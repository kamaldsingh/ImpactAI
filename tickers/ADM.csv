certainly. [operator instructions] eric larson with buckingham research. your line is open.
eric larson -- buckingham research -- analyst
yeah. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, eric.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, eric.
eric larson -- buckingham research -- analyst
so my first -- my first question is ray's comments on fourth quarter ag services. it's -- obviously we don't know your ownership position to net debt segment was actually quite a bit stronger than i had thought for the quarter. so when you look at kind of the difficult harvest maybe farmers holding pretty tight to new crop, if you're limiting some of your merchandising opportunities, how does the fourth quarter -- how does all that play into your outlook for the fourth quarter?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think you're right. i mean, the general export environment remains somewhat challenge for the entire us agricultural industry, but sequentially we're having a later harvest this year. so we will be procuring. i mean we have procured a lot. we will continue to procure. we will be exporting of all of the two markets outside of china.
the other thing to note is that, with the wet harvest that we're having. we are anticipating to gain some significant drawing revenue as well within our business. and then also just want to remind people that, our ag services division really has diversified significantly. and so when you take a look at some of the other businesses such as the stevedoring business such as the global trade business, such as the destination marketing business, every year those businesses represent a greater contribution to our overall results within ag services.
so, as i indicated in the call. i mean, we do believe on a sequential basis, ag services will be stronger in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
eric larson -- buckingham research -- analyst
okay. on a year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis, will you expect it to be flat, down, up sequentially, obviously a little bit better than q3, but how might that compare with q4, a year ago?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. versus last year, but probably be similar to slightly better directionally in that area, just speaking of what we're seeing here.
eric larson -- buckingham research -- analyst
okay. so, and then the combination of crush, your crushing results and wilmar, i would assume that wilmar is facing some pretty tough comps in q4. so, i would assume that, that was probably going to be down year-over-year as well, would that be a fair observation.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we said on crush again -- so crush will be -- compared to the third quarter, crush, we expect to be sequentially down in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter. again a lot of it will be a function crush margins kind of evolve, right, in the fourth quarter. on the case of wilmar, i mean, wilmar will be announced in earnings in a couple of weeks. so i think you'll have a better perspective in terms of what it means for our fourth quarter after wilmar announces its results there.
eric larson -- buckingham research -- analyst
okay, thank you. i'll pass it on.

juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
i wanted to ask a question as it relates to argentina, given the political change there and the prospect for a potential return to elevated export taxes, is it possible that dynamic, that constrict the exports of oilseeds derivative products out of argentina. so that could be a net positive for your overall crushing margins operations. i know you don't have argentina exposure, but just curious to hear your thoughts there. and then also kind of just opposing that with potentially weaker meal demand at philippines and vietnam as a result of the asf in the near term would be helpful. thanks.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, ben, so argentina change governments and of course part of these government in their previous experience has got some export taxes for the country. the country faces significant pace of their debt going forward. so of course, the economic situation is to be consolidated. and obviously the ag industry is one of the biggest revenue producers of argentina. so, the possibilities there, we don't know yet, december 10th is when they take power. i will say at this point in time, what's happening in argentina is crush is down, because basically the farmer given the results of the elections are holding to their grain.
so in that sense, we see lower crush which is always helpful for profitability in europe, i will say when crush from argentina is low. so whether that's going to happen next year or not, and to what degree. i think we will have to wait until december 10th.
your second question was on soybean meal demand. we actually continued to see strength outside china were forecast outside china, soybean meal growth is about 3%. and although there are a lot of headlines about asf may be expanding into southeast asia, we need to be mindful of the relative size of the market, like vietnam, versus a market like china. so i think that still the discussion is about china, that is what the gap in protein is.
and i will say, if you look at china and with the information we can get it feels to me that the decline in the herd has peaked or bottomed, whatever your perspective is on that. and i think that the incentives at big high prices are given and the producers are having record profits right now in china. they are starting to think about how to rebuild the herd. a lot of them have shifted. about a third of them have shifted into poultry production. that has softened a little bit decline in soybean meal, because obviously you need to feed them.
and a lot of people are looking at more sophisticated meals, because the whole production is being more professionalized and standards are rising. so i think that people are looking for higher quality feed producers and high quality feed of which soybean meal is inclusive in that. there is also these big prices that we have for pork, big pork inflation has created the incentives to increase weight before slaughtering. so we're seeing higher feed on animals as well. so i think in general, we continue to be positive about soybean meal demand going forward. we don't see a significant decline.
of course, i would say, we will have the balance that rebuild of the herd in china and all these things in china are going to be positive to demand, expansion in southeast asia is negative to demand. but i think given the magnitude of those, we are not that concerned about the expansion in south east asia.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay, very helpful. my second question relates to the ethanol business. you mentioned the formation of the subsidiary, curious around current improvement that we've seen in stocks, production levels kind of dipped in mid-september, they've been steadily climbing back. we have a lot of idled capacity in the us. i'm just curious to hear your thoughts around what you think about sustainability of improved performance in the near term. and then just your outlook to the extent that you can offer one in the intermediate term.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think, a couple of things. as juan indicated, we are setting up the stand-alone ethanol subsidiary as of december 1. just for context, starting january 1, we will report vantage corn processors as a separate sub-segment within carbohydrate solution. so clearly we're in the process of making sure transactions are occurring between the new subsidiary with adm. and so we're well on our way. and the good news is we've got quite a few interested parties that we're talking to right now at the initial stages about some form of sale joint venture or other type of structure transactions. so we're along the -- well along our way there in terms of our strategic alternatives.
you're correct. there has been idling of facilities, idling of production in united states with respect to ethanol, i think the ethanol margin environment this year clearly has been extremely challenging and as well oil [phonetic] production levels have come down. and that's frankly resulted in ethanol margins in the industry improving in the month of september, after labor day, which by the way it's unusual because normally after labor day you actually see ethanol margins deteriorate.
and so there has been some rebalancing of supply and demand. you point out, there is probably been an increase, a little bit of an increase in terms of production recently. we have to watch that carefully. i think what we've learned here, frankly is that when you get supply and demand a little bit more balanced, margins do improve in our industry here. and so we're looking at that very, very carefully. i think it is also important to note here in getting back to ethanol in terms of what ultimately will drive the ethanol margins higher is that we do need to drive incremental demand here.
and i think the discussions right now and the us trying to trade regarding ethanol are important, as a additional catalyst in terms of driving incremental demand for ethanol, which by the way, when we buy ethanol we've actually buying corn from united states. and so that's -- for the us agricultural industry, this is actually a very important part of the discussions here.
we also have the special refinery exemptions. we've had -- clearly have had some negative impact in 2019, but again there's further discussions in terms of that as we go forward. so i think that when you take a look at 2020. you asked the question. can it get worse than what we've seen in 2019? it's actually very difficult to see a scenario by the industry ethanol margins in 2020 being worse than 2019, because it's been tough in 2019. i'm somewhat encouraged to seeing, idling a facility. so there seems to be a little bit more discipline within the industry right now, in terms of just trying to better match supply and demand.
but again, i do believe that it is important that the us ethanol industry is strong, because that results in basically the us agricultural industry being strong. and so therefore, we remain optimistic that we'll get toward some solution that will drive incremental demand and hence stronger ethanol margins in the future for our industry here.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for your thoughts.

tom simonich with jpmorgan. your line is open.
tom simonich -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, tom. good morning.
tom simonich -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so, just following up on ethanol, could you give us your expectations for us ethanol exports in 2020 with and without china?
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think that 2020 scenario excluding china will be very similar to this year, which is approximately 1.5 billion gallons. i think if you include china, again a lot of it to be a function of when you get toward a trade deal and how that is phased in. we've always talked about the fact that china if they move toward an e10 national villain for the country based upon our calculations, they could easily by 1 billion gallons from united states.
i mean, because the deficit is fairly significant in terms of china production relative to their overall demand. now what number ultimately we'll get toward in terms of a trade negotiation. that's to be determined, based upon -- i suspect a phase in terms of a gallon or two [phonetic] over time here. so again, we've always thought that the potential could be up to 1 billion gallons down the road here.
tom simonich -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and on us corn exports, volumes are down 60% in 2019, '20 marketing year-to-date. when do you expect competition to ease at current exchange rates. in the usda, us corn [phonetic] goes down 8% in this marketing year and clearly there is still a long way to go, but how realistic is that projection?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think that is true. right now, us corn is not that competitive relative to say, south america, i mean, we do expect that eventually us corn will become competitive. our thinking is when we get into the first quarter, it's probably a good period whereby at that juncture us farmers will be looking probably to sell more of the corn, because as they start thinking about freeing up space and for next year.
so i think our assumptions right now in the fourth quarter, us exports in general will be all the challenge. and that's reflected in my guidance commentary here. getting the first quarter, you believe us corn will become more competitive, so that probably be more movements of us corn. i think the fact that you're not seeing that much pool of us corn in the fourth quarter. it actually is a benefit for the processors like us, because there is frankly a ton [phonetic] of us corn for us to actually pull in order to put into our corn processing plants. and so, from a processing business that's a benefit for us.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
then also -- tom also don't forget with these competitiveness over brazil, we are exhausting the inventories in brazil and due to the dryness, soybean was a little bit late in being planted that may make -- suffering been a little bit late as well. that may extend the window for the us to be competitive when ray mentioned in q1. so that's another possibility there.

michael piken with cleveland research. your line is open.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah, good morning. just wanted to dig a little bit deeper as we sort of think about the crushing environment in the us. i know previously you had said that potentially we could see something close to $1 margins, i guess on the board crush on the basis that if china has taken less soybean. if there is a lack of a trade agreement. i mean how do you see the market evolving, given that the us pork production numbers are up and the chicken production numbers are up and yet the crush margins have been on the board at least a little bit weaker.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, michael, thank you for the question. listen, we believe in the fundamentals of the crush margins business going forward. of course, the market right now is trying to digest alot of significant changes, whether it is chinese soybean buying patterns and the us, the size of the us crop. some of the timing of the asf impact that we will eventually see here. so i would say we've seen a decline in crush margins over the q3, but we also see in that when crush margins decline, the industry react, because demand continues to be, as i said before about 3% and fundamentally sound. so we've seen already crush in argentina taken down a little bit.
we've seen some of the plants that are dedicated to export in brazil, taking some of that capacity there. we've seen some shift in europe also from soybean to rate, just because there is more profitability there. so i think that we see the industry adjusting. in the us, we continue to see our customers announcing production increases going forward, and if you think about what happened over the last two weeks, we've seen a recovery in crush margins of about $0.15 per bushel. so they are kind of climbing back to maybe the five year average. so again, i think that we knew that it could be a short term blip when china accounts for sporadic purchases of us soybeans.
but the fundamentals are there. and we think all these blips are temporarily best. so we feel good about our q4. we came into q4 with a reasonable hedge book for crush. we also have some positions into q1. so we have visibility into what's happening, and we are fundamentally believers in the crush environment for 2020, given 3% growth outside china.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
terrific. and then just shifting gears, i know i've asked this question before. but on the readiness initiatives, do you have any more clarity on where we might see the accrued savings, which segments, like little bit of a breakdown in -- is nutrition getting any of it or, currently how for it would be...
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, i will say, michael, readiness come in several buckets as i was describing earlier. but i will say, given that a lot of those savings are coming from operations, the big businesses that own the big assets is where you see most of the benefits. so you're going to see it in corn, you're going to see it in oilseeds and ag services.
i would say nutrition earnings are driven mostly from growth and the impact that our value proposition have some customers and those applications. so we are outperforming market rates and we continue to grow our ebitda margin on sales on that and that's not readiness related. they are improving with readiness because the whole company is get invested and executing. but it's mostly the success of our value proposition. i would say most of the readiness efforts, you're going to see them in either corporate or corn and oilseeds and ag services.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst

vincent andrews with morgan stanley, your line is open.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is steve haynes on for vincent. just so maybe a quick question on capex. since you mentioned that you found some more opportunity to optimize capital allocation, kind of what's the go-forward run rate for capex, as we think about 2020?
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. when we look at 2020, we're still going through the plan, but it will be in the range of maybe $800 million. so if you think about it -- that's why we've been trickling down to those levels from the $1 billion level. depreciation and amortization, given neovia these days is about $1 billion. so it will be a little bit under that. and we feel comfortable. we said it before that our five year plan doesn't have anything spectacular, put there is mostly harvesting plan.
so you will see our capex in that range and it may fluctuate that we do things like one adm and all that, but it will not fluctuate more than just $50 million or $100 million up or down depending on the year, but putting something in the range of $800 million to $850 million is reasonable going forward for us for the few years ahead of us.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then if i could just squeeze in a follow-up, any updates on the house to you, in terms of us production and maybe some early thoughts on what's going on the southern hemisphere.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
the production of what, sorry, i couldn't hear a word.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just us corn production, us soybean productions and then just kind of the house view.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, well, the crop is late and now harvest started and then wet conditions make it stop. and i would say the farmer right now is shifting more to harvest in the beans, and they may come back to corn later. there has been rumors in south america about weather. i will say it has rained in argentina recently that has benefited the crops. so i wouldn't put lot of issuing to argentine weather. brazil, we're talking about dryness, but i live three years in brazil, brazil is a tropical country, it always rains. so it will catch up with that. so i would say, i wouldn't put a lot of weather into south america yet.
south america, weather is more important into january, february, we will. i guess here, i think the farmer will deal with this weather and will harvest the crop -- whether the crop initial results in terms of yield, you have your favorite numbers out there, may be coming a little bit softer in terms of yield that may be initially expected but too early to tell probably, steve.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you.

vincent anderson with stifel. your line is open.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. thank you. i appreciate your earlier commentary on african swine fever, but i was hoping you could talk about maybe what has surprised you the most in terms of how the situation has played out over the course of 2019, and how you're positioning yourself now and specifically, have you continue to see feed mills closing in china, given the somewhat more sustained demand that we've seen in feed than maybe we initially expected.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, vincent. i would say the thing that surprises the most probably is, maybe we -- without the acceleration of growth of production outside china was going to be faster its taking some of these countries, whether it is brazil and all that, a little bit of time to grow their chickens and all that. so i would say, we didn't see right now the extra impact you now we're crushing compounds about that extra demand that we are expecting. we think we're going to see that in 2020, but it didn't happen in the second half of the year.
i still maintain, what i said in the second quarter of our earnings call that second half for us will be stronger than first half. and we have line of sight on that and i can say that with confidence. so that hasn't changed. i would say in china, we see this structural shift into more professionally driven farms and productions. that as i said, is going to be a positive for us. we have not shut down any of our plans, and we are planning to, because we think that sophisticated feed rations and sophisticated feed producers like us will be seek to help the industry getting out of these. china will have to produce again and certainly we will not do it in the same conditions that they've done it today because that had broaden asf.
so we feel there is a lot of work to do and we're working closely with our chinese counterparts in that. i would say outside china, i think that given the conditions are different, although the disease has spread. i think that the ability to discount is to control the disease is better than what china has. so, the disease can impact your country and you're going to still continue to produce and continue to be an export that we have seen it with europe for many years. so we are a little bit more positive about that.
and as i said at the beginning is that there is magnitude between what happened in south east asia versus the amount of pork that is produced in china. it makes it just a china discussion at least from my perspective.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you. and just staying on the topic of asf we've read studies showing that the virus has a pretty decent half-life and contaminated feed, how exposed is your global feed network right now to potentially being part of the viruses spread. are you situated now in any countries with asf in terms of your feed production assets or are those assets really only moving feed, between other infected areas?
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a very good question, because we need to be very vigilant. so it makes for that nobody contributes to the spread of this disease. we see the spreads, because people move either pork, people move food around countries. i would say in the feed side, i mean we have extreme care in making sure as i said that feed doesn't grow into areas where, from areas with disease to areas without the disease, and without the proper care. so i would say we have extreme measures on that. as we have a extreme measures on everything we touch, i mean we are a food company, so quality and preservation of the value chain and value integrity, if you will, is paramount to us. so very much on top of our agenda.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. and actually if i could sneak in just a real quick follow-up, how strong would you say your feed in mid [phonetic] portfolio is right now and is that a place you see yourself making incremental investment if a vaccine is truly years off, like some experts are saying.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we expect our feed business is part of our growth in the nutrition division. of course, so you saw our investment in neovia, significantly expanding our footprint in asia. so we have very big prospects for that. and we understand, as you're pointing it out at the asf will be a multi-year impact in the industry. so we think we're going to have to work together with our chinese counterparts to bring new technologies and more sophisticated feeds and systems into the country and we are ready to do so.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks for your time.

robert moskow with credit suisse. your line is open.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, thanks. i wanted to do a little checking on the neovia acquisition. and just a math here like you paid $3 billion for wild, and it looks like the returns are good on that acquisition. it's $360 million of operating profit or so, but neovia you paid $1.8 billion. it looks like maybe $30 million of operating income per year right now. i think when you bought it, it was earning over $100 million. can you please correct me if my math is wrong and if not maybe tell us again, is there, has there been a step backward on this business in year one after the acquisition?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think, rob, i think that when you look at soybean, nutrition line, you could be careful because, lysine, as juan indicated, which is part of the animal nutrition line, it's actually suffering from the impact of excess lysine, the world due to asf. and so there is a negative number in the animal nutrition line which kind of mass -- kind of the benefits of neovia.
so when we look at neovia relative to our deal model, it's basically in line with our deal model in the first year. again we closed one month later. we also had some adjustments due to inventory, due to ppa, but you take that out of the consideration. it's in line with their deal model right now. and so when we look out into the future, especially given that the cost synergies are coming in a lot faster than what we thought. we feel good about the acquisition in terms of the context of our financial objectives including return objectives right now.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
where your return objectives more stringent on neovia or more liberal than for wild?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
they're consistent. i mean, we always said that's important on the strategic acquisitions that by the time we get to year three that we're earning in excess of our cost of capital.

adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, good morning. you hear me.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. i was hoping you guys could comment a little bit on the outlook in starches and sweeteners. and just maybe any thoughts on how the contracting season is progressing and more broadly, the impact of some of the dislocations in corn basis, co-products and late harvest and how that's impacting kind of the business and how you think about some of the improvement from your own operations that you should be having going into 2020.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so a lot to wrap up in the question. so i would say, let's start with the contracting season, i mean is going as expected. i think there is no, i mean, i think everybody wants to see what's happening with corn and how the planting goes. so it may be a little bit more, may be a little slower than other years, but is progressing along and is ongoing, so we normally comment as you know in our next earnings call. so when we talk at the end of january or february on this and the results of that is going ok.
i would say this quarter, it was a tough quarter for carbohydrate solutions in general. you saw that we have higher corn costs, higher corn costs than normally by this time of the year we will see a little bit more of a break -- given the harvest. and this year we see maybe a little bit better or may be basis break in a little bit more on the west than then maybe in east.
i would say the biggest drivers this quarter of the shortfall, if you will have been higher corn cost, which were offset a little bit by better manufacturing costs, given the improvements that we then indicated, but not completely. and then some issues that we have in europe, we have a business in europe that has been affected by the turkey sweeteners quota. and that's probably something that maybe you didn't have that much visibility as you look at the numbers from the outside.
i think from a volumes perspective, volumes have evolved as expected i would say, sweeteners, remain consistent with what we've been communicated in which year-to-date, they are down less than 2%. when we look at starches, this is a better story and starches story is, our volumes were basically flat, because we are out of capacity, but we've been able to play with the product mix and shift time of that to the higher value margins. and so we have expanded margins and of course, of our announcement of the repurposing of marshall. so, to be able to shift some of our 42 capacity into starches, just because of the growth that, and the opportunities we seen in that, especially in the food area.
so all in all, we continue to be positive about this business. sweeteners and starches or starches and sweetener is a very solid type of business and we get good returns here. so we are positive about it.
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
adam, just to give a perspective, i know like on a quarter-to-quarter basis were down $38 million in starches and sweeteners compared to last year, but it's important get to context. i mean, milling last year we had some very strong procurement gains. this year, we have smaller procurement gains. and so the milling division were down about $10 million. and then on the corn starches and sweeteners, the majority of the other variance actually relate to european operations as juan indicated. we're down in north america a bit due to just higher net corn costs.
but the majority of the variance is really attributable to more of the emea operations, which is again a lot of this deal in the turkish quota situation, is just due to the european sugar prices, which by the way is starting to recover right now, so there is a lot of transitory issues that are in europe, which are going to pass here.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that color is really helpful. and then just second for me. last quarter you had kind of talked about give or take $500 million of operating earnings improvement potential in 2020 from the readiness initiatives and normalizing of production at the decatur and the absence of just the absence of some of the flooding in the north american weather, the spring, does that guidance or that view still hold, that opportunity still in front of you.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think adam we like to present it that way because those are things under our control. and those are not forecast, but actually plans that our actions behind those things. so we continue our -- and probably with the exception of the weather that we hope that is not going to be as exceptional as it was this year. but part of that is to continue to fix the leakages of the issue that we have indicator on lysine that we work, we are finalizing that, but we're not going to have those issues in the 2020.
we're going to have the full run rate of some of the organizational changes we have this year and we are controlling that pretty tightly. so it's going to happen. as i described before, i think readiness, we're going to have another $600 million of run rate increments. and we have those, we have the process, so we don't need to invent anything. we just need to move the project along. and then we have all the incremental harvesting from m&a and the growth and you saw the results of nutrition this quarter.
and you're going to see similar jumps in nutrition as we go forward, we look at q4 even q4 for nutrition, we think the possibility of also about doubling the results of q4 last year. so when you have almost two consecutive quarters of doubling. you can think of what is the potential for next year. so we feel very good about that number of maybe $500 million to $600 million improvements that are under our control come into the p&l next year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst

yeah, i mean basis as juan commented, basis is actually fairly high. i mean, particularly on the east coast, the eastern part of united states, the western side has come off a little bit but again on a -- when you look at it from a seasonal perspective, we've got extremely high basis compared to historical norms. our -- i mentioned that part of the reason why our third quarter and north american sweetener results were slightly down versus last year is just due to the fact that we had higher net corn costs, we normally hedge a lot of it, but there is a certain portion we don't hedge. and so for the unhedged portion we incurred some higher costs.
as we kind of look forward, we do believe at some juncture, corn will get commercialized. i mean the crop is out there, it's a late harvest. i mean remember only 41% of the us corn has been harvested right now versus five year average of 60%. so it is the late harvest, but some juncture that the harvest will occur, there will be accumulation. and at some juncture there'll be commercialization, especially as us corn becomes more competitive in the world markets. and so the timing of when basis will break, is it going to be, latter part of the fourth quarter? is it going to be the first quarter? to be determined, at some juncture we do believe that there will be a break in the basis here. and that will benefit the originators like us.
heather jones -- heather jones research -- analyst
and my final question is just asf and one of the times when i was on the call i heard juan mentioning that there, given the margins in china and all there is some producers that are trying to expand. and i was just wondering if you could add further color on that. because like vietnam, continues to have recurrent breaks china is having recurrent breaks. so it's like wondering if you could qualify the magnitude you're seeing there.
and then secondly if you could give further color on when you expect the benefit to show, and 2020 because of the trade issues, the impact on us producers has been delayed and like do you expect that expansion start in early '20 or do you think that's going to happen more in late '20 and just if you could give us some more details on that.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so difficult to speculate in all these -- but i would say, given the information we have on the ground in china, we do know that producers are increasing the weight of the peaks before slaughtering. we do know that -- we certainly know we have data from our team that about one-third of the producers have shifted to poultry production given the opportunity there.
and we do know that the incentive, that price is providing to some of these producers, especially for the more industrial ones, they are starting to rebuild the herd. those were they ones that were preserved the most, if you will, and less impacted and they have better sanitary [phonetic] conditions. very difficult for me to put any numbers beyond these heather in terms of what, what we know, because it's a large country with many operations like this.
in terms of the impact to us, i would say we're going to see the impact in 2020. we're starting to see the impact in brazil or in europe. i think the impact on the us, i mean, you see our customers haven't getting ready whether is getting rid of -- i mean or getting ready to export, it will depend on what's happened with the 62% tariff that china is imposing to that, if they want to get rid of with that, if they want to issue a tariff exemption, or is there is, this is part of the phase 1 deal, we will have to see, it's difficult to handicap.
i would say we will see it in europe and south america certainly started on the first half, whether we see in north america will depend on the geopolitics of all these which i want handicap at this point.
heather jones -- heather jones research -- analyst
that was excellent. thank you so much.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

your final question comes from the line of ken zaslow with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning. i know there's been a lot of questions asked about this, but just, is there a way to just frame how much the delayed harvest has actually impeded your profit in 2019?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i guess that's a complicated -- complicated question.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i know, and someone have...
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there is just other factors, right, impact is whole, it's not just a supply issue, in terms of us procuring the crop. it is also demand since the china is not really aggressively in the market here. so it's a complicated issue, to say that just because of a delayed harvest, it has this much impact. i do think that, ken, the way we kind of think about it is that eventually the harvest will occur, eventually we're going to be procuring all the products, eventually united states is going to be competitive in corn and soybeans. and so, eventually we will be moving the crop out to the world markets here.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think, ken, the way i tend to think about it is sometimes is not that much the volume or the delay in the harvest is, what that does to the farmers market in beef pattern, if you will. and i think what it does today, since they don't know the size they're holding to the grain. and that's where the impact comes, that's where we're having high basis today when we should -- basis should break more at the harvest, but the farmer doesn't know with 40% and at this time of the year being late, what kind of crop he has. so i think as ray said at the end, we're going to have a big crop. there are big inventories, all that will be moved to the market. we will move that. we will try a lot of that, because it's going to be with an early, but i think the main issue is how all these things, whether it is china trade or whether it is the delay impacts farmer commercialization. that's probably the biggest disrupt for us. and today you see it in our, in some of the impact, we are getting in basis in the us.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, but you do you think that over time, i mean it is profit but between the china trade deal as well as delayed harvest that you will regain somewhere in 2020 or 2021 that will come fully back to you that 2019 will be kind of aberrational in terms of the profit level. is that a fair assessment?
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it depends some -- so some will come back, because we will commercialize that and we have the assets to do that. so we will go through our assets. some also will depend on the timing, because part of our previous years, ag services, great q4s, remember counted on both having an export, simultaneous strong soy and corn export programs out of the goal. that's what made elevation margins pulp. so part of that will depend on that dynamics and we will have to see it in the q4 of 2020 if you will.
but in the meantime, i think that our team has done well, look at this quarter. this quarter results product services given the lack of export volumes for corn, we're very significant. so i'm proud of how the team has been playing it. and i think the river getting back into navigation and normal rates has helped a lot that at the beginning of the year for the first half was almost impossible demand. so i think the team has done an outstanding job and ensure they will do the same in 2020.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

please turn to slide 3. i will now turn the call over to juan.
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. good morning, everyone. thank you all for joining us today. this morning we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.77, down from $0.92 in the prior year quarter. our adjusted segment operating profit was $764 million. our team delivered solid results this quarter.
we stayed focused on the levers we could control advancing our strategic plan despite the difficult external environment. north american grain export volumes and margins remained limited. crush margins were part of the record high 2018 levels and ethanol industry margins remained challenged. despite all of these, we delivered the performance consistent with the perspectives we provided last quarter, including the strong year-over-year growth in our nutrition business.
throughout the quarter, we continued to deliver on our strategic plan. in our optimize pillar we are successfully capturing synergies offered by the midyear combination of our ag services and oilseeds business. by looking at the combined value chain of the new business, we've identified a wide range of opportunities to improve capital efficiency.
we have already executed more than $200 million of capital reduction initiatives. as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our us origination footprint, we completed our previously announced transaction with cargill to exchange grain elevators in illinois and indiana. we also celebrated the opening of our new state-of-the-art mill in mendota, illinois, an important milestone in our ongoing process of replacing older, higher cost plants with more efficient facilities.
and as we anticipated earlier this year, we're starting to see the positive impact of the measures we took to improve the long-term reliability of our decatur complex. in our drive pillar, we are continuing to see growing benefits of the improved analytics, technologies and processes we put in place after we launched readiness last year.
we're implementing innovative uses of ai, machine learning and robotic process automation across the company to do everything from identifying and solving it issues to reducing costs and improving efficiencies in our global business services center to helping our customer-facing teams, meet needs with more speed and flexibility.
on the organizational redesign we completed in the first half of the year, including transforming our it foundational services and centralizing our global operations organization is delivering higher service levels at lower costs. in our expand pillar, a key element of our growth strategy is focusing on major global trends. trends that have the potential to fundamentally change markets and in which we are solidifying our global leadership position.
the first of those game-changing trends is one we see in the headlines every day now, flexitarian diets. adm has a rich history of a leader in plant-based meat alternatives. today our full-time tree [phonetic] of great tasting, innovative flavors, ingredients & solutions make us the provider of choice for customers looking to grow with this fast moving market.
our new plant protein facilities in campo grande, brazil and enderlin, north dakota are supporting the increased demand from our global customer base. and in the third quarter, we entered into a partnership with the world's largest beef patty producer to co-develop and produce a 100% alternative protein burger that is now being offered in brazil.
another major global trend is nutrition for health. we are capitalizing on our investments in biopolis and protexin with the goal of building a leadership position in science-based microbiome solutions for human and animal health. there are tremendous opportunities here, such as our recent announcement of promising results from clinical trials of our probiotics for skin health.
another growing trend is sustainable materials. our long-standing expertise and technology and fermentation and our research and development capabilities give us industry-leading abilities to provide the review of feedstocks and underpin the creation of innovative sustainable progress.
last year in partnership with dupont, we opened the world's first production facility for sbme, which has applications as a sustainable replacement for plastics. on last month, we announced an agreement with lg chem to develop sustainable super-absorbent polymers. this is a growing earlier and we plan to continue to expand our presence on it.
please turn to slide 4. readiness continues to underpin our strategic work and help drive our results. this quarter our list of completed initiatives has grown to 218 which taken together will account for about $515 million in run rate benefits on an annual basis. we remain on target for our two year goal of $1.2 billion in annual run rate benefits by the end of 2020.
as of the end of the third quarter, readiness have contributed close to $200 million in 2019 in year accrued results. we are confident we will reach our goal of $250 million to $300 million of accrued benefits by the end of this year. finally, more than half of our global workforce of 40,000 has now completed our comprehensive ability to execute or aid to retraining since we began the program.
this training is a critical part of readiness. it lays the foundation for the permanent culture change that we're working to instill to make our company better. in some ways, we are entering a new phase of readiness. we are moving on to a more complex to more complex projects that will take longer to complete, but will deliver more fundamental changes to how we run our company.
and while external conditions in 2019 are impacting overall results, the benefits we're seeing from readiness are real. and more importantly, they are long lasting. these changes will make adm better for the long run.
i'll discuss readiness more later. now, ray will take us through our business performance. ray?
ray g. young -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
please turn to slide number 5, beginning this quarter, we are simplifying the financial information that i will be speaking to, on our calls. however, all the data we have included in the past will be included in the appendix of our quarterly slide deck. as juan mentioned adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.77, down from the $0.92 per share in the prior year quarter.
excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $764 million down 11%. our trailing four quarter average adjusted roic was 6.5% slightly below our 2019 wacc of 6.75%. the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was approximately 19% in line with the range of guidance we provided last quarter.
for the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%, which was our initial guidance. we generated about $1.7 billion of cash from operations before working capital in the first nine months of the year, slightly lower than the prior year period. return of capital for the first nine months was about $740 million, including about $150 million in opportunistic share repurchases throughout the year to offset dilution. we finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 30% up from the 27% in the year ago quarter and continuing to improve from the first quarter high relate to the acquisition of neovia. capital spending for the year is forecast to be around $850 million in line with our previous guidance of $800 million to $900 million.
turning to slide 6, other business results were $47 million, significantly above the prior-year period, largely due to favorable underwriting results in captive insurance. revised full year estimate for other will be in the $70 million to $80 million range, lower than the $80 million to $90 million. we previously guided, largely due to lower expected underwriting performance in the fourth quarter. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $139 million were down versus the prior-year period, principally due to lower accruals for performance-related compensation and the benefits of our restructuring earlier this year. partially offset by higher spending in it, as part of our business process transformation investment and by readiness-related cost.
as a result we're expecting full year unallocated corporate cost to be in a range of $625 million to $650 million, significantly below the $700 million initial guidance we previously communicated. net interest expense for the quarter was similar to last year's quarter. we continue to expect full year interest expense on a segment presentation basis to be in the range of $350 million to $375 million, down from our initial guidance of $400 million.
corporate results also include non-cash early retirement charges and global workforce restructuring charges of $47 million or $0.07 per share in the lifo credit of $16 million or $0.02 per share. next, i'll discuss our business segment performance for the quarter. please turn to slide number 7.
our newly combined ag services and oilseeds business reported results that were lower than the third quarter of 2018, but up over the second quarter of this year. ag services results were in line with the prior year quarter. in north america improved merchandising results, particularly from ownership positions in corn and soybeans help to offset a weak us export environment.
south american results were higher as we capture better origination margin opportunities in brazil compared to the previous year and export volumes from argentina increased. crush results were down year-over-year. global crush margins have come down from the record high levels of last year, but our teams nevertheless delivered solid margins in north america and emea in the third quarter.
in south america, margins were pressured by higher input costs caused by continued chinese demand for brazilian soybeans. overall, our global crush margins benefited from positive net timing effects of approximately $50 million during the third quarter. refined products and other results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2018, largely driven by significant improvements in our golden peanut and tree nuts business. wilmar results were lower year-over-year.
now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect ag services and oilseeds results to be substantially lower year-over-year, though performance should be stronger than the third quarter of this year with ag services expected to be sequentially better and crushing expected to be sequentially down.
slide 8 please. carbohydrate solutions results were substantially lower than the year-ago period. starches and sweetener results were down versus the third quarter of 2018. in north america, higher net corn costs, pressured margins, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs including the benefits of our work to improve the reliability of our decatur corn complex.
starch volumes remained steady. in emea continued challenging market conditions including pressure from turkish sweetener quotas and lower liquid sweetener prices impacting central and eastern european operations led to low results for the year. in wheat milling, an increase in sales volume was more than offset by lower margins due to limited opportunities in wheat procurement. bioproducts results were significantly lower driven by high industry inventories and higher net corn costs in north america, leading to a challenged industry margin environment. ethanol margin conditions remain negatively impacted by the lack of chinese purchases from the us and by the small refinery exemptions.
looking ahead with typical seasonal reductions in sales volumes for sweeteners and for ethanol, as well as the continued difficult conditions for the ethanol business, we expect fourth quarter results in carbohydrate solutions to remain challenged, but with the continued benefits of our improvements at the decatur complex we expect fourth quarter results to be sequentially similar to the quarter just ended.
on to slide number 9. nutrition results were substantially higher with operating profits approaching double the year ago quarter. wfsi results were significantly higher than prior-year quarter, with growth across the portfolio. wild flavors delivered its strongest quarterly profit ever. sales were up 16% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. organic sales, excluding acquisitions were up 7%.
in specialty ingredients, the protein business continue to expand powered by our leadership position in supplying solutions to meet growing customer demand for alternative proteins. continued contributions from our growth investments in bioactives and fibers support higher results in the health & wellness business.
animal nutrition results were up substantially year-over-year as our neovia acquisition continues to contribute. vitamin additives were another strong performer, particularly coming off the year ago period when margins were significantly compressed. lysine production is showing improvement, though market pricing has been negatively impacted by the lower global demand due to the effects of the african swine fever in asia. with a robust pipeline of new opportunities and continued benefits from investments we expect nutrition's growth story to continue in the fourth quarter. with results once again approaching double the prior year fourth quarter profit of $62 million.
wfsi should continue to benefit from increasing sales in flavors and alternative proteins solutions. neovia will contribute to improve animal nutrition results. the results will be impacted by the lysine production in the world markets. juan?
juan r. luciano -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. please turn to slide 10. as ray explained market conditions in the third quarter remained challenging. yet we delivered what we said we would, three months ago. we pull the levers that were under our control to turning a solid performance and i appreciate the team's good work.
we also continue to focus on the three key areas of our growth and returns algorithm. first, we improved underperforming businesses. golden peanuts and tree nuts, our decatur complex and lysine production are all showing improved results. and we are now targeting december 1st for the launch of vantage corn processors, our stand-alone ethanol subsidiary.
this is an important step as we continue to evaluate the strategic alternatives for our dry mills. second, readiness continues to spur our efforts to make adm a more efficient, more innovative and more customer-focused company. we are seeing some truly exciting readiness initiatives advance in the back half of this year.
for example, we've completed the pilot program in one of our oilseeds processing facilities that utilizes advanced analytics to deliver real time analysis and -- of production data, significantly increasing efficiency and quality. we're now rolling this technology out to more plans, leveraging the center of excellence structure we put into place for our global operations.
we've also piloted and are rolling out an innovative data mining and analytics package that will provide our merchandising and sales teams with an important new tool set to better capture market opportunities. we're also seeing good progress and results from the third pillar of our algorithm, harvesting our growth investments. back at the beginning of the year, we said we expected 2019, to be a breakout year for nutrition. for the first three quarters of 2019, our nutrition business has delivered $316 million in adjusted operating profit, just shy of the total for all of 2018. additionally, we are delivering on our synergy targets for our neovia integration and that business is strongly contributing to our results.
and we're also seeing the benefits of growth in our core businesses. from our expanding stevedoring and destination marketing businesses to the development of new applications from our full portfolio of vegetable oils to our increasing capabilities in food grade and industrial starches.
we are making good progress, however, while we believe our results this quarter were solid in the context of the external headwinds we face. our team nevertheless is not satisfied. there is still more we can and will do to reach our returns objectives. looking ahead, we expect some external headwinds to continue in the foreseeable future. conditions are fluid, however external conditions, good or bad, do not change our fundamental plan. we will remain focused on taking actions under our control to improve our near term results.
and we will continue to advance our strategic objectives including driving growth from the major global trends i discussed earlier. we remain confident that our strategy combined with our continued disciplined capital allocation, position us well for stronger results in 2020 and beyond.
with that, jack, please open the line for questions.
",2019-Q3,ADM
-0.5847,1.0,1.0,0.7446,":
operator
[operator instructions]. your first question is from michael piken of cleveland research.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah, good morning. congratulations on the great quarter. just wanted to dig a little bit more into your thoughts on how us crushing is going to play out throughout the year. i understand 1q is going to be really strong, but are you worried about tightness and availability of soybeans as we move into the spring and summer and how are you sort of positioning your crushing business in case the markets gets a little bit tighter?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. michael, thank you for the question. good morning. listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for oilseeds and ag services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. if you think about 2021, we're starting with tailwinds from 2020. so, we're starting from a different position. and we're starting the year with improved global crush margins versus q1 last year. so, we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. we see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptional crop and recover after many years of softness in the soft seed crush. and i'd remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in soft seed and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. so, that's a competitive advantage for adm.
we see a strong demand for mill and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today -- are about 20% higher than at the same time last year. and not only coming from food demand, but also from fuel. a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean demand and margins. and we think that that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand.
so, all in all, we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then, just as a follow-up, in your slide deck, you talked about -- on slide 13 -- having $295 million of cumulative crush deferred timing gains. is that all showing up in oilseed crush or is that across the whole portfolio? and if you could give us any sort of help in terms of the cadence of when we might see that realized? is it going to be primarily in 1q or more spread -- evenly spread throughout the first half? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. michael, it's ray here. so, this is in the crush part of the ag services and oilseeds. as you pointed out, we increased by $125 million in the quarter. so, now we have a balance about $295 million in timing effects. we expect that roughly half will get reversed in the first quarter based upon the book that we have right now. and then, the other half will be reversed over the second and third quarters. and actually, we will see how prices move, but this is our current expectations in terms of how we expect this to play out over the course of '21.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question is from adam samuelson of goldman sachs.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, i guess, my first question was going to be around the carbohydrate solutions business. and i know you've talked about kind of seeing pathway for growth there and understanding kind of -- especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and weak volumes on the hfcs side. but help us think through some of the different pieces there. ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. let me start here. so, it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? because 2020 -- when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by covid-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? so, what they did was they really managed product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. they managed the ethanol production well and frankly had a positive impact on industry margins through the dialing actions it took. but what a lot of people forget is, we have an international business that's growing. right? so, we're expanding capacity over in europe. and the european operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. they contributed there. and in the north america milling operations, their footprint optimization is really paying off, with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19.
so, when you think about 2021, this playbook continues. right? so, number one, we do expect stabilizations in the north american starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery in demand for certain products occur, with the dissipation of lockdowns. secondly, they continue to drive great product portfolio mix, particularly in the area liquid dextrose and maltodextrins and citric acid. those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. thirdly, continued international growth. so, think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. our european operations whereby we've added capacity continues to drive growth. they're going to be another contributor. and then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
now, getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we started off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. but if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in march. we don't see that, right? so, when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis, but we do expect that the industry supply demand balances in the ethanol industry to get balanced as we move through the year. for several reasons.
number one, china actually has been buying us ethanol. that's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. and we believe that they've already made commitments already in the first half of the year for us ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. and so, we'll have to see where china ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of us ethanol.
secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol toward other products. so, that's going to have an impact in industry supply and demand.
thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remains idled. and from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. and hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that.
and then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the supreme court rules on it will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. and if you take a look at rins pricing right now, there is an expectation in the us that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just a recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year and then, secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the sres will play out.
so, overall, adam, we feel good about how we start the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses, but we do see -- particularly in the area of ethanol, we see greenshoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's a lot of really helpful color. and if i could just squeeze a second one just on the balance sheet. just given the move-up in commodity prices, the increased cost of inventory, how do we think about kind of the tolerance for more offensive capital deployment in terms of buybacks or m&a over the course of -- over '21? how much gunpowder do you think you have as we sit here today?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
well, we finished the year, actually, from a leverage perspective on a debt to ebitda ratio in reasonable position because, as you know, inventory financing from a rating agency perspective, you get rmi credit. right? so, with the movement in higher commodity prices which move working capital higher, clearly, we're financing it. and one of the things very different than the last crisis back in 2008 is that we've really diversified our working capital lines. and so, i feel good about our ability to finance higher working capital levels. but from a leverage perspective, with the rmi credits, our leverage -- our balance sheet remains strong. and so, we believe we've got firepower in order to continue to look at opportunistic m&a, opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. i really appreciate all the color. i'll pass it on. thank you.

your next question is from vincent andrews of morgan stanley.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and good morning, everyone. ray, just wanted to ask you -- i just wanted to ask you both about the inverse that we see in the corn and soy markets and how you're going to manage that in the ag services business this year and what challenges or opportunities does that present for you?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, vince. listen, the inverse certainly is indicating the farmers and everybody to bring the product to the market. so, we see a little bit of destocking. of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- hold inventory through the inverse. what we are seeing is that that inverse is bringing -- is bringing clear seasons for exports for north america and south america. and we think that that's an advantage for the ag services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. so, you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the tide shifted immediately for the us. the us is starting from an extended window of exports because brazil started a little bit late the planting.
so, we are starting with good margins. we are starting with good exports for the first quarter. for the first quarter, vince, we expect us record volumes for q1. and then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong q4. so, we're very, very optimistic about it.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. if i could just follow up on freight rates, they really have run up. is that something that you benefit from because presumably you have long-term contracts that those freight rates have to get pushed into sort of the market pricing and you just maybe get the benefit on the revenue line, but don't experience the cost? or is there a different dynamic there?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
no. i think you are correct in your assessment. and you also have to understand the value of the full value chain that we're running adm. when i describe. for example, record exports, that means also record loads for artco. so, we get a secondary stream of profits from there for the full value chain. we have stevedoring. we have the barges and we have the export terminal. so, the whole -- when you have that kind of volumes. the whole value chain gets enhanced margins all through the chain.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, very good. i appreciate the comments. i'll pass it along.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from ben bienvenu of stephens.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
good morning, ben.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to ask your outlook for the year for 2021. you made a note in your press release and your comments that you expect improved market conditions. i suspect in light of the detailed comments that you gave, you're referring to the carbohydrate solutions group particularly, but i'd be curious what you're expecting on the ag services and oilseeds? is 2020 a number that you think is probable to be eclipsed for ebit based on the market view that you have right now? or how should we be thinking about that sort of?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. ben, when i think about the three businesses for 2021, and when we think about the strong 2021, the ag services and oilseeds business will be a very, very strong year. as i said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with -- maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in rpo business or maybe south american oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business. we still expect exports from ag services to be very strong. we have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which i think we're going to have a strong year. we don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. so, we plan another outstanding year for ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carb solutions, i think that that's the business, as ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impacted by covid-19. and we think that -- last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. and we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some export to china in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020.
and the nutrition business will continue to grow. we are investing in that business and it's a business that have a strong organic growth program and we see in that range as i mentioned before. when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition, as we grow nutrition to the $1 billion op during our plan, we look for a 15% cagar to get there and that's what we're expecting for this year. so, that's kind of how i think about 2021.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's great. and if i could, as it relates to 1q, in particular for carbohydrate solutions, you noted you expect results to be significantly higher than 1q '20, but lower than 4q '20. that's a pretty big range. is there any more granularity you could provide there. should we be thinking about something north of $100 million based on the current market view? or is that too high? maybe just any more specificity, if you're willing to give it, on that segment, in particular in 1q. and then, i'll let leave it...
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
a lot of it's going be a function of kind of where ethanol moves over the course of the year. we expect it to be over $100 million. we expect it to be over $100 million. so, where we land, a lot of it is where ethanol kind of moves over the next couple of months here. but again, if you recall, last year, we had about $65 million of negative corn oil mark-to-market. that won't get repeated. so, that's going to be a benefit in our first quarter results this year.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you both. and best of luck in this year.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your next question is from robert moskow of credit suisse.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. congratulations on a great year. i wanted to know if you have any color for us on the impact of rising corn costs. there is some comparison -- i guess, benefits compared to -- benefits compared to last year where you had -- corn oil was out of sync. but is rising corn cost going to be a problem for carbohydrate solutions at any point? and maybe you could talk more specifically about high fructose corn syrup negotiations. and were you able to increase your prices to offset the higher corn costs? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. rob, it's ray here. a couple of things to note. first of all, the team did an outstanding job on risk management. so, without disclosing everything that they do, it's fair to say that we had a lot of our requirements for 2021 hedged before the significant run-up in terms of corn costs. so, i think that the team did some great work in terms of anticipating how s&ds would actually work over the course of 2021.
with respect to the contracts, just a reminder, not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. we have multi-year contracts. and so, certain amount of contracts got negotiated. and the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go through 2021 relative to 2020 through a combination of contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our cost there.
the other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen whole product values go up. that's a benefit for our businesses as well. so, i think in the fourth quarter, we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs. we expect that the team is also going to be able to manage through '21 with good net corn costs as well. so, i think the teams -- the carbs sol team, they'd done an outstanding job on the risk management side and managing through the higher corn cost environment here.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
rob, if i may add, i think something that gives us confidence because, of course, the team is pretty good at doing this, is that in very tight markets, then the fundamentals become more important because markets move more based on fundamentals. and there, the information we have, the visibility we have in the network becomes much more important to make decisions than in other times when maybe materials are a little bit longer and softer. then there are more variables that come into play.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
and maybe you can't give this much detail, but in the contracts that you were negotiating, were you able to negotiate prices higher in reaction to higher corn or was it not like that?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
i think, rob, let's keep it to the fact that we've been able to manage in total, the portfolio, the contracts and been able to maintain the margins year-over-year. that's a level of, i think, disclosure we want to make at this point. thank you.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks.
operator
your next question is from ken zaslow of bmo.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i have two questions. first, the capex spending has gone up. what are you incrementally spending on and what do you think the returns are? and when will you actually get the returns associated with that? and how do we think about the incremental projects there? that's my first question.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
so, ken, a couple of things on the increased capex. one, i mentioned that we are in the midst of the business transformation program. so, 2021 will be one of our peak years in the 1adm project. so, we do have some incremental capitalized cost associated with the program. that's part of our capex budget.
secondly, with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over. it got pushed from 2020 into 2021. some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects, some of them are just non-discretionary expenditure projects. so, there is a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to 2021 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute.
and then thirdly, we do have growth projects. we mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area. so, we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021.
so, those are the three buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 to 2021. again, the range $900 million is a large range. we haven't approved some of these projects, and we're just putting it in terms of a placeholder. but part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns and determining would we actually spend it in the course of ' 21 or not. but as you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to prove these projects.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
and i'd remind you, ken, that, first of all, we are also becoming a larger company, so there are projects now that are organic projects coming from the new neovia acquisition, the animal nutrition, we are expanding our bioactives production in valencia, spain. so, we are becoming a larger company. and i also remind you that we have a program to divest, to reduce capital investment and we achieved $300 million in that side of the ledger. so, we'll continue with the same capital discipline than before. you can be assured of that.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and then, my second question. really more of a clarification. you said, in 2021, eps and operating profit will be higher year-over-year or could be significantly higher. i've got the exact word. but does that include or exclude the $295 million? and then i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
you're referring to the $295 million of timing effects, ken?
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. are you going to be able to grow numbers outside that $295 million? or is that $295 million included in what you think is going to be a year-over-year?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
it's all included there. it's all included in the number there, ken. all included.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
would you be able to grow even without that? or is that part of the -- i guess i'm just trying to figure out, when you say significant growth, kind of is that beyond the $295 million or is that including? if you didn't have the $295 million, would you still be able to grow? and i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's lot of puts and takes there, ken, right? and so, i think it's fair to say that our pre-tax numbers are going to grow significantly, and there is going to be a little bit of -- you take a little bit off with a higher tax rate. i think that's probably the more important factors. our higher tax rate will skim off a lot of the pre-tax improvement that we're going to drive, '21 versus '20.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, guys, very much.

thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
just following up on us export strength. how much us corn do you expect china to import beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes, tom. sorry. i was trying to get my mask off. we're expecting china to take about 25 million tons of corn. so, you know the situation there in china. we think that the inventories are -- reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there. you can see that in the prices that we've seen. and china didn't have a great crop. so, we expect significant imports for both oilseeds and corn.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
sorry. do you think that 25 million tons is sustainable beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we think so. we think so. of course, not all comes from the us. come from different sources. but it is. and china is trying other things as well. they are reducing a little bit their wheat stocks. they have imported a lot of wheat from australia as well. remember that all this is driven by the recovery from asf. they are trying to rebuild the herd. but also, by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains in the ration. so, we think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in china's appetite for all these commodities.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you. and maybe you could break down your nutrition outlook for 2021. you mentioned the 15% segment profit growth. how does that compare -- so human versus animal nutrition?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. they have different dynamics. so, human nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline and we feel very strongly about that. our pipeline continues to grow and our win rates continues to grow. animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by covid, in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at homes, while on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. so, i would say there are puts and takes there. difficult to judge ahead of time.
i think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that, that's a business that is investing in growth, but it also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. and i think we're going to continue to see that, with, as i said, a different path to growth, with animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in asia and in parts of latin america, and then in human nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in north america and europe.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. i'll pass it on.

eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a really good year.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you, eric.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, eric.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
so, one, i just wanted to dive a little -- i just want to add a little bit -- my first question is on nutrition is to add a little bit more clarity to that. last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. you've built a lot of plants in south america, in asia for your nutrition business. and i still expect that harvesting -- that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition? and i'm sure it differs between human and animal. but can you help us with that a little bit?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say the harvesting continues. these plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in campo grande. so, we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully.
i would say the 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will. again, another round of investment. some of those things are capabilities, whether it is customer insights and marketing, whether it is new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually. and even a lot of organic growth. we have -- we kind of went live in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. and to be honest, because the covid environment didn't allow for a lot of project work. and now, we are going into more of that. so, you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that, in capabilities and plants.
and we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. we are a science-based nutrition company. but you see, for example, in the quarter, we got two awards. we got the fie award for innovation in pea protein and we got the big innovation award for bpl1, one of our probiotics. so, we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest -- and the harvesting, you see in how our roic continues to grow in that business. and you see the success of our value proposition in how the ebitda margins continue to grow in our business.
so, we are very happy. but, eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. we are probably halfway through that build.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the color there. so, juan, the question that i haven't -- you've talked a lot about demand around the world, which is even surprisingly strong despite the grain pricing environment that we have, which is pretty high, and we're still seeing good exports, but when you look at the us crop, upcoming planting season this year, you look at what's going on in south america, which is -- clearly, the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of brazil and they're not going to get that. we're seeing wheat in russia. it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. it might take a couple of years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. can you kind of encapsulate how adm is looking at the next two years regarding demand and supply of global grains?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. we see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there. and to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been destocking, going hand to mouth with this inverse. so, we see truly a strong demand. and tight balance sheets. as you said, corn and oilseeds, i think they're going to touch a pipeline balance sheet. wheat is a little bit stronger, but the black sea has not had a great wheat season, although australia has a wheat growing season. so, we see -- this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply demand balances to be rebuilt. so, we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years, even with farmers, imagine like you, trying to plant more because i think that these prices will bring more acres into production. but we need those extra acres right now.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. not only plant more acres, but we'll also try to maximize our yield. so, it's a combination of both. so, thank you, gentlemen. i'll pass it on.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your final question is from ben theurer of barclays.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
yeah. good morning, juan, ray. and congrats on the results. just wanted to follow up on the capex related to the different businesses. and clearly, you've been putting a lot of emphasis on the growth and the prospects within nutrition and you just said this will be another year in the need of investments in order to get to that 15% cagr you've been talking about. so, if we think about the capex in general, that $900 million to maybe a $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last two years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that capex to the different segments, and in particularly to the nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you're adding to that business?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. something that you have to understand -- and i'm going to speak at high level here. but the nutrition has a different op to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. these projects are -- so sometimes you have big projects like campo grande for specialty proteins. but the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of capex to get one unit of op, sometimes in nutrition, you get a one-on-one. so, i think the issue is that, because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their p&l because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business.
but i would say, the nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. so, when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition organic growth project, those are small projects. they are not in the hundreds of millions of dollar type of projects.
so, i would say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. that's why we are growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion even when we're doing 1adm and all that. so, i think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's a couple -- ben, there's a couple of large projects in the carb solutions business that we're finishing up in 2021. so, the bulgaria expansion, we're finishing up. we're finishing up the building on the feed house in clinton. so, there is a couple of chunky investments that we're just finishing up over the course of '21.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay, perfect. ray, thanks. and then, one final one, just netting it out, you've been talking about the ethanol imports over to china, but then how is that netting out versus brazil and what you're seeing there? is it just tit-for-tat south to north or how is the balance currently on that export business to china?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
i think, listen, exports to china, we've been talking a lot about that. we expect this year, we will be at the record high. so, they are taking because corn is expensive in china. you also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are at all-time high. so, in brazil, you make a choice. so, it's different than the us. in brazil, you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol. and of course, sugar prices are a big temptation this year. so, we expect higher exports and maybe we expect a little bit of a less pressure from brazil in that sense.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst

juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. this morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior-year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.15 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019.
for the full year, we delivered record adjusted eps of $3.59, $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019, four straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth, and trailing four-quarter adjusted roic of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. we maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.
the team managed a wide variety of risks superbly and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth.
i'd like to thank our team for the tremendous performance. i'll highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. in our optimize pillar, around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from covid-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain, and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world.
beyond that, for the year, our ag services and oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives. and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business, from digital technologies like our grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers, and adm.
in our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1adm business transformation projects, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence.
we continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. we achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. and we are partnering with farmers in their efforts to pull better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
in our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our plantplus foods joint venture.
and amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilized new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
our carbohydrate solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and usp grade alcohol for hand sanitizer. and the adm team showed its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
finally, i'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness runway benefits by the end of the year. readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. perhaps, most importantly, today, we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture. it's how we work.
thanks to these impressive achievements, i'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. this dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 89 years.
it's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow.
even more important is how we are building for the future. we've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
i'll be talking about that shortly. but first, let me turn the call over to ray to take us through our business performance. ray?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, juan. and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide number 4. as juan mentioned, adjusted eps for the quarter was $1.21, down from $1.42 in the prior-year quarter. as a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
our trailing four-quarter average adjusted roic was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual wacc. and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ebitda was about $3.7 billion.
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. the calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of us tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold.
absent the effect of eps adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%.
looking ahead, we're expecting full-year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
we generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends.
we finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. for 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
slide 5 please. other business results were substantially lower than the prior-year quarter. adm investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior-year quarter. for 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020.
in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased it and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from neovia.
other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses, partially offset by the absence of prior-year investment gains.
for 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
net interest expense for the quarter was lower than the last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. for 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
slide 6, please. the ag services and oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year, with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. ag services results were significantly higher year-over-year. in north america, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from china, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. south american origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020.
global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand.
approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected. crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior-year period. the business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. there was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved soft seed margins.
refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results driven primarily by solid south american margins.
wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake.
for the full year, ag services and oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time high global crush volumes. in addition, we're proud of the teams that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year.
looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for ag services and oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong north american export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
slide 7, please. the carbohydrate solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. the starches and sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intercompany insurance settlements.
earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins. vantage corn processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect a challenging ethanol industry environment. the team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for usp grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills.
considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our carbohydrate solutions team for delivering full-year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. the team achieved record high operating profits from starches in the year. they acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 vcp dry mill plans, helping address industry supply and demand balances. and the wheat milling business' modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in mendota, illinois helped power a significant improvement over full-year 2019 for that business.
looking ahead, we expect carbohydrate solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
slide 8 please. the nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. in human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter, driven by good sales and product mix in north america and emeai.
continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics and natural health and nutrition. prior-year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic spiber relationship.
human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intercompany insurance settlement.
animal nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in asia and emeai and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in latin america.
we're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
for the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. the nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continued to expand ebitda margins. we exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition.
looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year, but the first quarter should be similar to the prior-year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
with that, let me turn it over to juan to conclude. juan?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 9 please. i'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. i am proud of what we achieved and i'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights.
in 2020, ag services and oilseeds capitalized on its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet the strong demand. in 2021, we expect ag services and oilseeds' strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive soft seed footprint, and important strategic work to continue to drive results.
in addition, we expect the global demand environment for ag services and oilseeds to remain strong. china should continue to be a significant buyer. we see continued strong global growth in mill demand and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for foodservice and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel.
that is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carbohydrate solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. the team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. and their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off.
now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. we expect solid profit growth for the year for carbohydrate solutions.
nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trend areas and partnered with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth, consistent with our strategic plan.
across adm, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. we are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise, and we are making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
in 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset, and continuing to generate benefits from readiness.
with the strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit and another record year of eps in 2021.
with that, shelby, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions]. your first question is from michael piken of cleveland research.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah, good morning. congratulations on the great quarter. just wanted to dig a little bit more into your thoughts on how us crushing is going to play out throughout the year. i understand 1q is going to be really strong, but are you worried about tightness and availability of soybeans as we move into the spring and summer and how are you sort of positioning your crushing business in case the markets gets a little bit tighter?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. michael, thank you for the question. good morning. listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for oilseeds and ag services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. if you think about 2021, we're starting with tailwinds from 2020. so, we're starting from a different position. and we're starting the year with improved global crush margins versus q1 last year. so, we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. we see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptional crop and recover after many years of softness in the soft seed crush. and i'd remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in soft seed and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. so, that's a competitive advantage for adm.
we see a strong demand for mill and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today -- are about 20% higher than at the same time last year. and not only coming from food demand, but also from fuel. a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean demand and margins. and we think that that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand.
so, all in all, we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then, just as a follow-up, in your slide deck, you talked about -- on slide 13 -- having $295 million of cumulative crush deferred timing gains. is that all showing up in oilseed crush or is that across the whole portfolio? and if you could give us any sort of help in terms of the cadence of when we might see that realized? is it going to be primarily in 1q or more spread -- evenly spread throughout the first half? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. michael, it's ray here. so, this is in the crush part of the ag services and oilseeds. as you pointed out, we increased by $125 million in the quarter. so, now we have a balance about $295 million in timing effects. we expect that roughly half will get reversed in the first quarter based upon the book that we have right now. and then, the other half will be reversed over the second and third quarters. and actually, we will see how prices move, but this is our current expectations in terms of how we expect this to play out over the course of '21.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst

your next question is from adam samuelson of goldman sachs.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, i guess, my first question was going to be around the carbohydrate solutions business. and i know you've talked about kind of seeing pathway for growth there and understanding kind of -- especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and weak volumes on the hfcs side. but help us think through some of the different pieces there. ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. let me start here. so, it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? because 2020 -- when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by covid-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? so, what they did was they really managed product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. they managed the ethanol production well and frankly had a positive impact on industry margins through the dialing actions it took. but what a lot of people forget is, we have an international business that's growing. right? so, we're expanding capacity over in europe. and the european operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. they contributed there. and in the north america milling operations, their footprint optimization is really paying off, with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19.
so, when you think about 2021, this playbook continues. right? so, number one, we do expect stabilizations in the north american starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery in demand for certain products occur, with the dissipation of lockdowns. secondly, they continue to drive great product portfolio mix, particularly in the area liquid dextrose and maltodextrins and citric acid. those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. thirdly, continued international growth. so, think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. our european operations whereby we've added capacity continues to drive growth. they're going to be another contributor. and then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
now, getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we started off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. but if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in march. we don't see that, right? so, when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis, but we do expect that the industry supply demand balances in the ethanol industry to get balanced as we move through the year. for several reasons.
number one, china actually has been buying us ethanol. that's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. and we believe that they've already made commitments already in the first half of the year for us ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. and so, we'll have to see where china ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of us ethanol.
secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol toward other products. so, that's going to have an impact in industry supply and demand.
thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remains idled. and from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. and hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that.
and then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the supreme court rules on it will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. and if you take a look at rins pricing right now, there is an expectation in the us that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just a recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year and then, secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the sres will play out.
so, overall, adam, we feel good about how we start the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses, but we do see -- particularly in the area of ethanol, we see greenshoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's a lot of really helpful color. and if i could just squeeze a second one just on the balance sheet. just given the move-up in commodity prices, the increased cost of inventory, how do we think about kind of the tolerance for more offensive capital deployment in terms of buybacks or m&a over the course of -- over '21? how much gunpowder do you think you have as we sit here today?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
well, we finished the year, actually, from a leverage perspective on a debt to ebitda ratio in reasonable position because, as you know, inventory financing from a rating agency perspective, you get rmi credit. right? so, with the movement in higher commodity prices which move working capital higher, clearly, we're financing it. and one of the things very different than the last crisis back in 2008 is that we've really diversified our working capital lines. and so, i feel good about our ability to finance higher working capital levels. but from a leverage perspective, with the rmi credits, our leverage -- our balance sheet remains strong. and so, we believe we've got firepower in order to continue to look at opportunistic m&a, opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. i really appreciate all the color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
operator
your next question is from vincent andrews of morgan stanley.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and good morning, everyone. ray, just wanted to ask you -- i just wanted to ask you both about the inverse that we see in the corn and soy markets and how you're going to manage that in the ag services business this year and what challenges or opportunities does that present for you?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, vince. listen, the inverse certainly is indicating the farmers and everybody to bring the product to the market. so, we see a little bit of destocking. of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- hold inventory through the inverse. what we are seeing is that that inverse is bringing -- is bringing clear seasons for exports for north america and south america. and we think that that's an advantage for the ag services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. so, you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the tide shifted immediately for the us. the us is starting from an extended window of exports because brazil started a little bit late the planting.
so, we are starting with good margins. we are starting with good exports for the first quarter. for the first quarter, vince, we expect us record volumes for q1. and then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong q4. so, we're very, very optimistic about it.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. if i could just follow up on freight rates, they really have run up. is that something that you benefit from because presumably you have long-term contracts that those freight rates have to get pushed into sort of the market pricing and you just maybe get the benefit on the revenue line, but don't experience the cost? or is there a different dynamic there?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
no. i think you are correct in your assessment. and you also have to understand the value of the full value chain that we're running adm. when i describe. for example, record exports, that means also record loads for artco. so, we get a secondary stream of profits from there for the full value chain. we have stevedoring. we have the barges and we have the export terminal. so, the whole -- when you have that kind of volumes. the whole value chain gets enhanced margins all through the chain.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, very good. i appreciate the comments. i'll pass it along.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your next question is from ben bienvenu of stephens.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
good morning, ben.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to ask your outlook for the year for 2021. you made a note in your press release and your comments that you expect improved market conditions. i suspect in light of the detailed comments that you gave, you're referring to the carbohydrate solutions group particularly, but i'd be curious what you're expecting on the ag services and oilseeds? is 2020 a number that you think is probable to be eclipsed for ebit based on the market view that you have right now? or how should we be thinking about that sort of?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. ben, when i think about the three businesses for 2021, and when we think about the strong 2021, the ag services and oilseeds business will be a very, very strong year. as i said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with -- maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in rpo business or maybe south american oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business. we still expect exports from ag services to be very strong. we have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which i think we're going to have a strong year. we don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. so, we plan another outstanding year for ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carb solutions, i think that that's the business, as ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impacted by covid-19. and we think that -- last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. and we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some export to china in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020.
and the nutrition business will continue to grow. we are investing in that business and it's a business that have a strong organic growth program and we see in that range as i mentioned before. when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition, as we grow nutrition to the $1 billion op during our plan, we look for a 15% cagar to get there and that's what we're expecting for this year. so, that's kind of how i think about 2021.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's great. and if i could, as it relates to 1q, in particular for carbohydrate solutions, you noted you expect results to be significantly higher than 1q '20, but lower than 4q '20. that's a pretty big range. is there any more granularity you could provide there. should we be thinking about something north of $100 million based on the current market view? or is that too high? maybe just any more specificity, if you're willing to give it, on that segment, in particular in 1q. and then, i'll let leave it...
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
a lot of it's going be a function of kind of where ethanol moves over the course of the year. we expect it to be over $100 million. we expect it to be over $100 million. so, where we land, a lot of it is where ethanol kind of moves over the next couple of months here. but again, if you recall, last year, we had about $65 million of negative corn oil mark-to-market. that won't get repeated. so, that's going to be a benefit in our first quarter results this year.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you both. and best of luck in this year.

your next question is from robert moskow of credit suisse.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. congratulations on a great year. i wanted to know if you have any color for us on the impact of rising corn costs. there is some comparison -- i guess, benefits compared to -- benefits compared to last year where you had -- corn oil was out of sync. but is rising corn cost going to be a problem for carbohydrate solutions at any point? and maybe you could talk more specifically about high fructose corn syrup negotiations. and were you able to increase your prices to offset the higher corn costs? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. rob, it's ray here. a couple of things to note. first of all, the team did an outstanding job on risk management. so, without disclosing everything that they do, it's fair to say that we had a lot of our requirements for 2021 hedged before the significant run-up in terms of corn costs. so, i think that the team did some great work in terms of anticipating how s&ds would actually work over the course of 2021.
with respect to the contracts, just a reminder, not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. we have multi-year contracts. and so, certain amount of contracts got negotiated. and the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go through 2021 relative to 2020 through a combination of contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our cost there.
the other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen whole product values go up. that's a benefit for our businesses as well. so, i think in the fourth quarter, we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs. we expect that the team is also going to be able to manage through '21 with good net corn costs as well. so, i think the teams -- the carbs sol team, they'd done an outstanding job on the risk management side and managing through the higher corn cost environment here.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
rob, if i may add, i think something that gives us confidence because, of course, the team is pretty good at doing this, is that in very tight markets, then the fundamentals become more important because markets move more based on fundamentals. and there, the information we have, the visibility we have in the network becomes much more important to make decisions than in other times when maybe materials are a little bit longer and softer. then there are more variables that come into play.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
and maybe you can't give this much detail, but in the contracts that you were negotiating, were you able to negotiate prices higher in reaction to higher corn or was it not like that?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
i think, rob, let's keep it to the fact that we've been able to manage in total, the portfolio, the contracts and been able to maintain the margins year-over-year. that's a level of, i think, disclosure we want to make at this point. thank you.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

your next question is from ken zaslow of bmo.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i have two questions. first, the capex spending has gone up. what are you incrementally spending on and what do you think the returns are? and when will you actually get the returns associated with that? and how do we think about the incremental projects there? that's my first question.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
so, ken, a couple of things on the increased capex. one, i mentioned that we are in the midst of the business transformation program. so, 2021 will be one of our peak years in the 1adm project. so, we do have some incremental capitalized cost associated with the program. that's part of our capex budget.
secondly, with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over. it got pushed from 2020 into 2021. some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects, some of them are just non-discretionary expenditure projects. so, there is a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to 2021 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute.
and then thirdly, we do have growth projects. we mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area. so, we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021.
so, those are the three buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 to 2021. again, the range $900 million is a large range. we haven't approved some of these projects, and we're just putting it in terms of a placeholder. but part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns and determining would we actually spend it in the course of ' 21 or not. but as you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to prove these projects.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
and i'd remind you, ken, that, first of all, we are also becoming a larger company, so there are projects now that are organic projects coming from the new neovia acquisition, the animal nutrition, we are expanding our bioactives production in valencia, spain. so, we are becoming a larger company. and i also remind you that we have a program to divest, to reduce capital investment and we achieved $300 million in that side of the ledger. so, we'll continue with the same capital discipline than before. you can be assured of that.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and then, my second question. really more of a clarification. you said, in 2021, eps and operating profit will be higher year-over-year or could be significantly higher. i've got the exact word. but does that include or exclude the $295 million? and then i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
you're referring to the $295 million of timing effects, ken?
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. are you going to be able to grow numbers outside that $295 million? or is that $295 million included in what you think is going to be a year-over-year?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
it's all included there. it's all included in the number there, ken. all included.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
would you be able to grow even without that? or is that part of the -- i guess i'm just trying to figure out, when you say significant growth, kind of is that beyond the $295 million or is that including? if you didn't have the $295 million, would you still be able to grow? and i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's lot of puts and takes there, ken, right? and so, i think it's fair to say that our pre-tax numbers are going to grow significantly, and there is going to be a little bit of -- you take a little bit off with a higher tax rate. i think that's probably the more important factors. our higher tax rate will skim off a lot of the pre-tax improvement that we're going to drive, '21 versus '20.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, guys, very much.

your next question is from tom simonitsch of jp morgan.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
just following up on us export strength. how much us corn do you expect china to import beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes, tom. sorry. i was trying to get my mask off. we're expecting china to take about 25 million tons of corn. so, you know the situation there in china. we think that the inventories are -- reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there. you can see that in the prices that we've seen. and china didn't have a great crop. so, we expect significant imports for both oilseeds and corn.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
sorry. do you think that 25 million tons is sustainable beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we think so. we think so. of course, not all comes from the us. come from different sources. but it is. and china is trying other things as well. they are reducing a little bit their wheat stocks. they have imported a lot of wheat from australia as well. remember that all this is driven by the recovery from asf. they are trying to rebuild the herd. but also, by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains in the ration. so, we think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in china's appetite for all these commodities.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you. and maybe you could break down your nutrition outlook for 2021. you mentioned the 15% segment profit growth. how does that compare -- so human versus animal nutrition?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. they have different dynamics. so, human nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline and we feel very strongly about that. our pipeline continues to grow and our win rates continues to grow. animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by covid, in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at homes, while on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. so, i would say there are puts and takes there. difficult to judge ahead of time.
i think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that, that's a business that is investing in growth, but it also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. and i think we're going to continue to see that, with, as i said, a different path to growth, with animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in asia and in parts of latin america, and then in human nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in north america and europe.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. i'll pass it on.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your next question is from eric larson of global securities.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a really good year.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you, eric.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, eric.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
so, one, i just wanted to dive a little -- i just want to add a little bit -- my first question is on nutrition is to add a little bit more clarity to that. last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. you've built a lot of plants in south america, in asia for your nutrition business. and i still expect that harvesting -- that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition? and i'm sure it differs between human and animal. but can you help us with that a little bit?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say the harvesting continues. these plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in campo grande. so, we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully.
i would say the 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will. again, another round of investment. some of those things are capabilities, whether it is customer insights and marketing, whether it is new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually. and even a lot of organic growth. we have -- we kind of went live in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. and to be honest, because the covid environment didn't allow for a lot of project work. and now, we are going into more of that. so, you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that, in capabilities and plants.
and we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. we are a science-based nutrition company. but you see, for example, in the quarter, we got two awards. we got the fie award for innovation in pea protein and we got the big innovation award for bpl1, one of our probiotics. so, we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest -- and the harvesting, you see in how our roic continues to grow in that business. and you see the success of our value proposition in how the ebitda margins continue to grow in our business.
so, we are very happy. but, eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. we are probably halfway through that build.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the color there. so, juan, the question that i haven't -- you've talked a lot about demand around the world, which is even surprisingly strong despite the grain pricing environment that we have, which is pretty high, and we're still seeing good exports, but when you look at the us crop, upcoming planting season this year, you look at what's going on in south america, which is -- clearly, the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of brazil and they're not going to get that. we're seeing wheat in russia. it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. it might take a couple of years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. can you kind of encapsulate how adm is looking at the next two years regarding demand and supply of global grains?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. we see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there. and to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been destocking, going hand to mouth with this inverse. so, we see truly a strong demand. and tight balance sheets. as you said, corn and oilseeds, i think they're going to touch a pipeline balance sheet. wheat is a little bit stronger, but the black sea has not had a great wheat season, although australia has a wheat growing season. so, we see -- this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply demand balances to be rebuilt. so, we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years, even with farmers, imagine like you, trying to plant more because i think that these prices will bring more acres into production. but we need those extra acres right now.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. not only plant more acres, but we'll also try to maximize our yield. so, it's a combination of both. so, thank you, gentlemen. i'll pass it on.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, eric.
operator
your final question is from ben theurer of barclays.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
yeah. good morning, juan, ray. and congrats on the results. just wanted to follow up on the capex related to the different businesses. and clearly, you've been putting a lot of emphasis on the growth and the prospects within nutrition and you just said this will be another year in the need of investments in order to get to that 15% cagr you've been talking about. so, if we think about the capex in general, that $900 million to maybe a $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last two years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that capex to the different segments, and in particularly to the nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you're adding to that business?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. something that you have to understand -- and i'm going to speak at high level here. but the nutrition has a different op to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. these projects are -- so sometimes you have big projects like campo grande for specialty proteins. but the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of capex to get one unit of op, sometimes in nutrition, you get a one-on-one. so, i think the issue is that, because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their p&l because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business.
but i would say, the nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. so, when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition organic growth project, those are small projects. they are not in the hundreds of millions of dollar type of projects.
so, i would say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. that's why we are growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion even when we're doing 1adm and all that. so, i think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's a couple -- ben, there's a couple of large projects in the carb solutions business that we're finishing up in 2021. so, the bulgaria expansion, we're finishing up. we're finishing up the building on the feed house in clinton. so, there is a couple of chunky investments that we're just finishing up over the course of '21.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay, perfect. ray, thanks. and then, one final one, just netting it out, you've been talking about the ethanol imports over to china, but then how is that netting out versus brazil and what you're seeing there? is it just tit-for-tat south to north or how is the balance currently on that export business to china?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
i think, listen, exports to china, we've been talking a lot about that. we expect this year, we will be at the record high. so, they are taking because corn is expensive in china. you also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are at all-time high. so, in brazil, you make a choice. so, it's different than the us. in brazil, you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol. and of course, sugar prices are a big temptation this year. so, we expect higher exports and maybe we expect a little bit of a less pressure from brazil in that sense.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you very much. leave it here.

please turn to slide 3. i will now turn the call over to juan.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. this morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior-year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.15 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019.
for the full year, we delivered record adjusted eps of $3.59, $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019, four straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth, and trailing four-quarter adjusted roic of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. we maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.
the team managed a wide variety of risks superbly and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth.
i'd like to thank our team for the tremendous performance. i'll highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. in our optimize pillar, around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from covid-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain, and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world.
beyond that, for the year, our ag services and oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives. and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business, from digital technologies like our grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers, and adm.
in our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1adm business transformation projects, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence.
we continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. we achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. and we are partnering with farmers in their efforts to pull better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
in our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our plantplus foods joint venture.
and amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilized new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
our carbohydrate solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and usp grade alcohol for hand sanitizer. and the adm team showed its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
finally, i'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness runway benefits by the end of the year. readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. perhaps, most importantly, today, we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture. it's how we work.
thanks to these impressive achievements, i'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. this dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 89 years.
it's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow.
even more important is how we are building for the future. we've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
i'll be talking about that shortly. but first, let me turn the call over to ray to take us through our business performance. ray?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, juan. and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide number 4. as juan mentioned, adjusted eps for the quarter was $1.21, down from $1.42 in the prior-year quarter. as a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
our trailing four-quarter average adjusted roic was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual wacc. and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ebitda was about $3.7 billion.
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. the calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of us tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold.
absent the effect of eps adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%.
looking ahead, we're expecting full-year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
we generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends.
we finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. for 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
slide 5 please. other business results were substantially lower than the prior-year quarter. adm investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior-year quarter. for 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020.
in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased it and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from neovia.
other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses, partially offset by the absence of prior-year investment gains.
for 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
net interest expense for the quarter was lower than the last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. for 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
slide 6, please. the ag services and oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year, with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. ag services results were significantly higher year-over-year. in north america, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from china, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. south american origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020.
global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand.
approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected. crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior-year period. the business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. there was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved soft seed margins.
refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results driven primarily by solid south american margins.
wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake.
for the full year, ag services and oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time high global crush volumes. in addition, we're proud of the teams that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year.
looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for ag services and oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong north american export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
slide 7, please. the carbohydrate solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. the starches and sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intercompany insurance settlements.
earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins. vantage corn processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect a challenging ethanol industry environment. the team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for usp grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills.
considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our carbohydrate solutions team for delivering full-year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. the team achieved record high operating profits from starches in the year. they acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 vcp dry mill plans, helping address industry supply and demand balances. and the wheat milling business' modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in mendota, illinois helped power a significant improvement over full-year 2019 for that business.
looking ahead, we expect carbohydrate solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
slide 8 please. the nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. in human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter, driven by good sales and product mix in north america and emeai.
continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics and natural health and nutrition. prior-year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic spiber relationship.
human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intercompany insurance settlement.
animal nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in asia and emeai and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in latin america.
we're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
for the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. the nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continued to expand ebitda margins. we exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition.
looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year, but the first quarter should be similar to the prior-year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
with that, let me turn it over to juan to conclude. juan?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 9 please. i'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. i am proud of what we achieved and i'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights.
in 2020, ag services and oilseeds capitalized on its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet the strong demand. in 2021, we expect ag services and oilseeds' strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive soft seed footprint, and important strategic work to continue to drive results.
in addition, we expect the global demand environment for ag services and oilseeds to remain strong. china should continue to be a significant buyer. we see continued strong global growth in mill demand and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for foodservice and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel.
that is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carbohydrate solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. the team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. and their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off.
now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. we expect solid profit growth for the year for carbohydrate solutions.
nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trend areas and partnered with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth, consistent with our strategic plan.
across adm, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. we are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise, and we are making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
in 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset, and continuing to generate benefits from readiness.
with the strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit and another record year of eps in 2021.
with that, shelby, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions]. your first question is from michael piken of cleveland research.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah, good morning. congratulations on the great quarter. just wanted to dig a little bit more into your thoughts on how us crushing is going to play out throughout the year. i understand 1q is going to be really strong, but are you worried about tightness and availability of soybeans as we move into the spring and summer and how are you sort of positioning your crushing business in case the markets gets a little bit tighter?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. michael, thank you for the question. good morning. listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for oilseeds and ag services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. if you think about 2021, we're starting with tailwinds from 2020. so, we're starting from a different position. and we're starting the year with improved global crush margins versus q1 last year. so, we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. we see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptional crop and recover after many years of softness in the soft seed crush. and i'd remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in soft seed and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. so, that's a competitive advantage for adm.
we see a strong demand for mill and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today -- are about 20% higher than at the same time last year. and not only coming from food demand, but also from fuel. a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean demand and margins. and we think that that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand.
so, all in all, we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then, just as a follow-up, in your slide deck, you talked about -- on slide 13 -- having $295 million of cumulative crush deferred timing gains. is that all showing up in oilseed crush or is that across the whole portfolio? and if you could give us any sort of help in terms of the cadence of when we might see that realized? is it going to be primarily in 1q or more spread -- evenly spread throughout the first half? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. michael, it's ray here. so, this is in the crush part of the ag services and oilseeds. as you pointed out, we increased by $125 million in the quarter. so, now we have a balance about $295 million in timing effects. we expect that roughly half will get reversed in the first quarter based upon the book that we have right now. and then, the other half will be reversed over the second and third quarters. and actually, we will see how prices move, but this is our current expectations in terms of how we expect this to play out over the course of '21.

so, i guess, my first question was going to be around the carbohydrate solutions business. and i know you've talked about kind of seeing pathway for growth there and understanding kind of -- especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and weak volumes on the hfcs side. but help us think through some of the different pieces there. ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. let me start here. so, it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? because 2020 -- when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by covid-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? so, what they did was they really managed product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. they managed the ethanol production well and frankly had a positive impact on industry margins through the dialing actions it took. but what a lot of people forget is, we have an international business that's growing. right? so, we're expanding capacity over in europe. and the european operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019. they contributed there. and in the north america milling operations, their footprint optimization is really paying off, with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19.
so, when you think about 2021, this playbook continues. right? so, number one, we do expect stabilizations in the north american starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery in demand for certain products occur, with the dissipation of lockdowns. secondly, they continue to drive great product portfolio mix, particularly in the area liquid dextrose and maltodextrins and citric acid. those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. thirdly, continued international growth. so, think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. our european operations whereby we've added capacity continues to drive growth. they're going to be another contributor. and then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
now, getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we started off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. but if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in march. we don't see that, right? so, when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis, but we do expect that the industry supply demand balances in the ethanol industry to get balanced as we move through the year. for several reasons.
number one, china actually has been buying us ethanol. that's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. and we believe that they've already made commitments already in the first half of the year for us ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. and so, we'll have to see where china ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of us ethanol.
secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol toward other products. so, that's going to have an impact in industry supply and demand.
thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remains idled. and from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. and hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that.
and then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the supreme court rules on it will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. and if you take a look at rins pricing right now, there is an expectation in the us that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just a recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year and then, secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the sres will play out.
so, overall, adam, we feel good about how we start the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses, but we do see -- particularly in the area of ethanol, we see greenshoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's a lot of really helpful color. and if i could just squeeze a second one just on the balance sheet. just given the move-up in commodity prices, the increased cost of inventory, how do we think about kind of the tolerance for more offensive capital deployment in terms of buybacks or m&a over the course of -- over '21? how much gunpowder do you think you have as we sit here today?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
well, we finished the year, actually, from a leverage perspective on a debt to ebitda ratio in reasonable position because, as you know, inventory financing from a rating agency perspective, you get rmi credit. right? so, with the movement in higher commodity prices which move working capital higher, clearly, we're financing it. and one of the things very different than the last crisis back in 2008 is that we've really diversified our working capital lines. and so, i feel good about our ability to finance higher working capital levels. but from a leverage perspective, with the rmi credits, our leverage -- our balance sheet remains strong. and so, we believe we've got firepower in order to continue to look at opportunistic m&a, opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. i really appreciate all the color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
operator
your next question is from vincent andrews of morgan stanley.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and good morning, everyone. ray, just wanted to ask you -- i just wanted to ask you both about the inverse that we see in the corn and soy markets and how you're going to manage that in the ag services business this year and what challenges or opportunities does that present for you?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, vince. listen, the inverse certainly is indicating the farmers and everybody to bring the product to the market. so, we see a little bit of destocking. of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- hold inventory through the inverse. what we are seeing is that that inverse is bringing -- is bringing clear seasons for exports for north america and south america. and we think that that's an advantage for the ag services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. so, you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the tide shifted immediately for the us. the us is starting from an extended window of exports because brazil started a little bit late the planting.
so, we are starting with good margins. we are starting with good exports for the first quarter. for the first quarter, vince, we expect us record volumes for q1. and then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong q4. so, we're very, very optimistic about it.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. if i could just follow up on freight rates, they really have run up. is that something that you benefit from because presumably you have long-term contracts that those freight rates have to get pushed into sort of the market pricing and you just maybe get the benefit on the revenue line, but don't experience the cost? or is there a different dynamic there?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
no. i think you are correct in your assessment. and you also have to understand the value of the full value chain that we're running adm. when i describe. for example, record exports, that means also record loads for artco. so, we get a secondary stream of profits from there for the full value chain. we have stevedoring. we have the barges and we have the export terminal. so, the whole -- when you have that kind of volumes. the whole value chain gets enhanced margins all through the chain.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, very good. i appreciate the comments. i'll pass it along.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from ben bienvenu of stephens.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
good morning, ben.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to ask your outlook for the year for 2021. you made a note in your press release and your comments that you expect improved market conditions. i suspect in light of the detailed comments that you gave, you're referring to the carbohydrate solutions group particularly, but i'd be curious what you're expecting on the ag services and oilseeds? is 2020 a number that you think is probable to be eclipsed for ebit based on the market view that you have right now? or how should we be thinking about that sort of?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. ben, when i think about the three businesses for 2021, and when we think about the strong 2021, the ag services and oilseeds business will be a very, very strong year. as i said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with -- maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in rpo business or maybe south american oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business. we still expect exports from ag services to be very strong. we have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which i think we're going to have a strong year. we don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. so, we plan another outstanding year for ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carb solutions, i think that that's the business, as ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impacted by covid-19. and we think that -- last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. and we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some export to china in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020.
and the nutrition business will continue to grow. we are investing in that business and it's a business that have a strong organic growth program and we see in that range as i mentioned before. when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition, as we grow nutrition to the $1 billion op during our plan, we look for a 15% cagar to get there and that's what we're expecting for this year. so, that's kind of how i think about 2021.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's great. and if i could, as it relates to 1q, in particular for carbohydrate solutions, you noted you expect results to be significantly higher than 1q '20, but lower than 4q '20. that's a pretty big range. is there any more granularity you could provide there. should we be thinking about something north of $100 million based on the current market view? or is that too high? maybe just any more specificity, if you're willing to give it, on that segment, in particular in 1q. and then, i'll let leave it...
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
a lot of it's going be a function of kind of where ethanol moves over the course of the year. we expect it to be over $100 million. we expect it to be over $100 million. so, where we land, a lot of it is where ethanol kind of moves over the next couple of months here. but again, if you recall, last year, we had about $65 million of negative corn oil mark-to-market. that won't get repeated. so, that's going to be a benefit in our first quarter results this year.
benjamin bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you both. and best of luck in this year.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your next question is from robert moskow of credit suisse.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. congratulations on a great year. i wanted to know if you have any color for us on the impact of rising corn costs. there is some comparison -- i guess, benefits compared to -- benefits compared to last year where you had -- corn oil was out of sync. but is rising corn cost going to be a problem for carbohydrate solutions at any point? and maybe you could talk more specifically about high fructose corn syrup negotiations. and were you able to increase your prices to offset the higher corn costs? thanks.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. rob, it's ray here. a couple of things to note. first of all, the team did an outstanding job on risk management. so, without disclosing everything that they do, it's fair to say that we had a lot of our requirements for 2021 hedged before the significant run-up in terms of corn costs. so, i think that the team did some great work in terms of anticipating how s&ds would actually work over the course of 2021.
with respect to the contracts, just a reminder, not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. we have multi-year contracts. and so, certain amount of contracts got negotiated. and the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go through 2021 relative to 2020 through a combination of contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our cost there.
the other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen whole product values go up. that's a benefit for our businesses as well. so, i think in the fourth quarter, we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs. we expect that the team is also going to be able to manage through '21 with good net corn costs as well. so, i think the teams -- the carbs sol team, they'd done an outstanding job on the risk management side and managing through the higher corn cost environment here.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
rob, if i may add, i think something that gives us confidence because, of course, the team is pretty good at doing this, is that in very tight markets, then the fundamentals become more important because markets move more based on fundamentals. and there, the information we have, the visibility we have in the network becomes much more important to make decisions than in other times when maybe materials are a little bit longer and softer. then there are more variables that come into play.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
and maybe you can't give this much detail, but in the contracts that you were negotiating, were you able to negotiate prices higher in reaction to higher corn or was it not like that?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
i think, rob, let's keep it to the fact that we've been able to manage in total, the portfolio, the contracts and been able to maintain the margins year-over-year. that's a level of, i think, disclosure we want to make at this point. thank you.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks.
operator
your next question is from ken zaslow of bmo.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i have two questions. first, the capex spending has gone up. what are you incrementally spending on and what do you think the returns are? and when will you actually get the returns associated with that? and how do we think about the incremental projects there? that's my first question.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
so, ken, a couple of things on the increased capex. one, i mentioned that we are in the midst of the business transformation program. so, 2021 will be one of our peak years in the 1adm project. so, we do have some incremental capitalized cost associated with the program. that's part of our capex budget.
secondly, with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over. it got pushed from 2020 into 2021. some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects, some of them are just non-discretionary expenditure projects. so, there is a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to 2021 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute.
and then thirdly, we do have growth projects. we mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area. so, we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021.
so, those are the three buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 to 2021. again, the range $900 million is a large range. we haven't approved some of these projects, and we're just putting it in terms of a placeholder. but part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns and determining would we actually spend it in the course of ' 21 or not. but as you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to prove these projects.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
and i'd remind you, ken, that, first of all, we are also becoming a larger company, so there are projects now that are organic projects coming from the new neovia acquisition, the animal nutrition, we are expanding our bioactives production in valencia, spain. so, we are becoming a larger company. and i also remind you that we have a program to divest, to reduce capital investment and we achieved $300 million in that side of the ledger. so, we'll continue with the same capital discipline than before. you can be assured of that.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and then, my second question. really more of a clarification. you said, in 2021, eps and operating profit will be higher year-over-year or could be significantly higher. i've got the exact word. but does that include or exclude the $295 million? and then i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
you're referring to the $295 million of timing effects, ken?
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. are you going to be able to grow numbers outside that $295 million? or is that $295 million included in what you think is going to be a year-over-year?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
it's all included there. it's all included in the number there, ken. all included.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
would you be able to grow even without that? or is that part of the -- i guess i'm just trying to figure out, when you say significant growth, kind of is that beyond the $295 million or is that including? if you didn't have the $295 million, would you still be able to grow? and i'll leave it there.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's lot of puts and takes there, ken, right? and so, i think it's fair to say that our pre-tax numbers are going to grow significantly, and there is going to be a little bit of -- you take a little bit off with a higher tax rate. i think that's probably the more important factors. our higher tax rate will skim off a lot of the pre-tax improvement that we're going to drive, '21 versus '20.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, guys, very much.

your next question is from tom simonitsch of jp morgan.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
just following up on us export strength. how much us corn do you expect china to import beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes, tom. sorry. i was trying to get my mask off. we're expecting china to take about 25 million tons of corn. so, you know the situation there in china. we think that the inventories are -- reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there. you can see that in the prices that we've seen. and china didn't have a great crop. so, we expect significant imports for both oilseeds and corn.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
sorry. do you think that 25 million tons is sustainable beyond this marketing year?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we think so. we think so. of course, not all comes from the us. come from different sources. but it is. and china is trying other things as well. they are reducing a little bit their wheat stocks. they have imported a lot of wheat from australia as well. remember that all this is driven by the recovery from asf. they are trying to rebuild the herd. but also, by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains in the ration. so, we think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in china's appetite for all these commodities.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you. and maybe you could break down your nutrition outlook for 2021. you mentioned the 15% segment profit growth. how does that compare -- so human versus animal nutrition?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yeah. they have different dynamics. so, human nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline and we feel very strongly about that. our pipeline continues to grow and our win rates continues to grow. animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by covid, in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at homes, while on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. so, i would say there are puts and takes there. difficult to judge ahead of time.
i think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that, that's a business that is investing in growth, but it also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. and i think we're going to continue to see that, with, as i said, a different path to growth, with animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in asia and in parts of latin america, and then in human nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in north america and europe.
thomas simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. i'll pass it on.

your next question is from eric larson of global securities.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a really good year.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you, eric.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, eric.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
so, one, i just wanted to dive a little -- i just want to add a little bit -- my first question is on nutrition is to add a little bit more clarity to that. last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. you've built a lot of plants in south america, in asia for your nutrition business. and i still expect that harvesting -- that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition? and i'm sure it differs between human and animal. but can you help us with that a little bit?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say the harvesting continues. these plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in campo grande. so, we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully.
i would say the 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will. again, another round of investment. some of those things are capabilities, whether it is customer insights and marketing, whether it is new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually. and even a lot of organic growth. we have -- we kind of went live in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. and to be honest, because the covid environment didn't allow for a lot of project work. and now, we are going into more of that. so, you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that, in capabilities and plants.
and we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. we are a science-based nutrition company. but you see, for example, in the quarter, we got two awards. we got the fie award for innovation in pea protein and we got the big innovation award for bpl1, one of our probiotics. so, we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest -- and the harvesting, you see in how our roic continues to grow in that business. and you see the success of our value proposition in how the ebitda margins continue to grow in our business.
so, we are very happy. but, eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. we are probably halfway through that build.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the color there. so, juan, the question that i haven't -- you've talked a lot about demand around the world, which is even surprisingly strong despite the grain pricing environment that we have, which is pretty high, and we're still seeing good exports, but when you look at the us crop, upcoming planting season this year, you look at what's going on in south america, which is -- clearly, the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of brazil and they're not going to get that. we're seeing wheat in russia. it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. it might take a couple of years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. can you kind of encapsulate how adm is looking at the next two years regarding demand and supply of global grains?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. we see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there. and to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been destocking, going hand to mouth with this inverse. so, we see truly a strong demand. and tight balance sheets. as you said, corn and oilseeds, i think they're going to touch a pipeline balance sheet. wheat is a little bit stronger, but the black sea has not had a great wheat season, although australia has a wheat growing season. so, we see -- this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply demand balances to be rebuilt. so, we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years, even with farmers, imagine like you, trying to plant more because i think that these prices will bring more acres into production. but we need those extra acres right now.
eric larson -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yeah. not only plant more acres, but we'll also try to maximize our yield. so, it's a combination of both. so, thank you, gentlemen. i'll pass it on.
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer

your final question is from ben theurer of barclays.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
yeah. good morning, juan, ray. and congrats on the results. just wanted to follow up on the capex related to the different businesses. and clearly, you've been putting a lot of emphasis on the growth and the prospects within nutrition and you just said this will be another year in the need of investments in order to get to that 15% cagr you've been talking about. so, if we think about the capex in general, that $900 million to maybe a $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last two years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that capex to the different segments, and in particularly to the nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you're adding to that business?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
yes. something that you have to understand -- and i'm going to speak at high level here. but the nutrition has a different op to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. these projects are -- so sometimes you have big projects like campo grande for specialty proteins. but the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of capex to get one unit of op, sometimes in nutrition, you get a one-on-one. so, i think the issue is that, because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their p&l because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business.
but i would say, the nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. so, when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition organic growth project, those are small projects. they are not in the hundreds of millions of dollar type of projects.
so, i would say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. that's why we are growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion even when we're doing 1adm and all that. so, i think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective.
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
there's a couple -- ben, there's a couple of large projects in the carb solutions business that we're finishing up in 2021. so, the bulgaria expansion, we're finishing up. we're finishing up the building on the feed house in clinton. so, there is a couple of chunky investments that we're just finishing up over the course of '21.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay, perfect. ray, thanks. and then, one final one, just netting it out, you've been talking about the ethanol imports over to china, but then how is that netting out versus brazil and what you're seeing there? is it just tit-for-tat south to north or how is the balance currently on that export business to china?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
i think, listen, exports to china, we've been talking a lot about that. we expect this year, we will be at the record high. so, they are taking because corn is expensive in china. you also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are at all-time high. so, in brazil, you make a choice. so, it's different than the us. in brazil, you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol. and of course, sugar prices are a big temptation this year. so, we expect higher exports and maybe we expect a little bit of a less pressure from brazil in that sense.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you very much. leave it here.

juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. this morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior-year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.15 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019.
for the full year, we delivered record adjusted eps of $3.59, $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019, four straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth, and trailing four-quarter adjusted roic of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. we maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.
the team managed a wide variety of risks superbly and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth.
i'd like to thank our team for the tremendous performance. i'll highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. in our optimize pillar, around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from covid-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain, and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world.
beyond that, for the year, our ag services and oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives. and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business, from digital technologies like our grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers, and adm.
in our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1adm business transformation projects, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence.
we continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. we achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. and we are partnering with farmers in their efforts to pull better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
in our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our plantplus foods joint venture.
and amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilized new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
our carbohydrate solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and usp grade alcohol for hand sanitizer. and the adm team showed its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
finally, i'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness runway benefits by the end of the year. readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. perhaps, most importantly, today, we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture. it's how we work.
thanks to these impressive achievements, i'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. this dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 89 years.
it's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow.
even more important is how we are building for the future. we've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
i'll be talking about that shortly. but first, let me turn the call over to ray to take us through our business performance. ray?
ray g. young -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, juan. and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide number 4. as juan mentioned, adjusted eps for the quarter was $1.21, down from $1.42 in the prior-year quarter. as a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
our trailing four-quarter average adjusted roic was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual wacc. and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ebitda was about $3.7 billion.
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. the calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of us tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold.
absent the effect of eps adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%.
looking ahead, we're expecting full-year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
we generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends.
we finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. for 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
slide 5 please. other business results were substantially lower than the prior-year quarter. adm investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior-year quarter. for 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020.
in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased it and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from neovia.
other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses, partially offset by the absence of prior-year investment gains.
for 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
net interest expense for the quarter was lower than the last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. for 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
slide 6, please. the ag services and oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year, with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. ag services results were significantly higher year-over-year. in north america, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from china, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. south american origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020.
global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand.
approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected. crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior-year period. the business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. there was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved soft seed margins.
refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results driven primarily by solid south american margins.
wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake.
for the full year, ag services and oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time high global crush volumes. in addition, we're proud of the teams that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year.
looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for ag services and oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong north american export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
slide 7, please. the carbohydrate solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. the starches and sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intercompany insurance settlements.
earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins. vantage corn processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect a challenging ethanol industry environment. the team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for usp grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills.
considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our carbohydrate solutions team for delivering full-year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. the team achieved record high operating profits from starches in the year. they acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 vcp dry mill plans, helping address industry supply and demand balances. and the wheat milling business' modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in mendota, illinois helped power a significant improvement over full-year 2019 for that business.
looking ahead, we expect carbohydrate solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
slide 8 please. the nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. in human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter, driven by good sales and product mix in north america and emeai.
continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics and natural health and nutrition. prior-year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic spiber relationship.
human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intercompany insurance settlement.
animal nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in asia and emeai and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in latin america.
we're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
for the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. the nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continued to expand ebitda margins. we exceeded our neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. we are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition.
looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year, but the first quarter should be similar to the prior-year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
with that, let me turn it over to juan to conclude. juan?
juan r. luciano -- chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 9 please. i'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. i am proud of what we achieved and i'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights.
in 2020, ag services and oilseeds capitalized on its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet the strong demand. in 2021, we expect ag services and oilseeds' strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive soft seed footprint, and important strategic work to continue to drive results.
in addition, we expect the global demand environment for ag services and oilseeds to remain strong. china should continue to be a significant buyer. we see continued strong global growth in mill demand and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for foodservice and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel.
that is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from ag services and oilseeds in 2021.
carbohydrate solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. the team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. and their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off.
now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. we expect solid profit growth for the year for carbohydrate solutions.
nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trend areas and partnered with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth, consistent with our strategic plan.
across adm, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. we are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise, and we are making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
in 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset, and continuing to generate benefits from readiness.
with the strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit and another record year of eps in 2021.
with that, shelby, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal. your line is open.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
just want to touch base. you kind of -- your comment was -- which was actually really interesting, that you expect growth, sustainable growth for years to come. so with that, just a couple of points. one is, do you look at 2021 or 2020 as the base year from which you can grow? and then second, what are the key demand drivers that you see beyond 2021 that will continue to propel you? or is it more internal actions that would create the growth?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, ken. listen, as i was referring in my remarks, we see the future with a lot of optimism. i mean we think that fundamentally, we have, as you know, a strong agenda of both now productivity and innovation where there are things that we can control, that we drive under our control. and we've been executing a similar plan. so now you're going to see it strengthen. and it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. but all this is in the -- as supported by these three strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. so let me give you a little bit of flavor there.
we continue to see strong demand. you see food security, of course, as the global population grows. protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. and as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. we see that in china, we see that in the u.s. and we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. so that's in an environment, ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. so we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events.
and we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions. so products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. we have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. so again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply/demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
so 2020 or 2021, would you say, is your year from which we could start thinking about growth?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that we -- 2021, we're going to grow significantly versus 2020. so in 2021, we are establishing this sharpening again. so if you will, maybe we can reset to that level to 2021, and we start from here. we have a rolling five-year plan, as you know, ken, that we constantly update. and we constantly make it more robust, so we can deliver earnings growth year-over-year.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
great. i appreciate. thank you.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ken.

your next question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. your line is open.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. so i guess my first question, really just trying to think about the market environment a little bit, and obviously, a lot of crop currents happening at the moment. specifically, i want to think about on the oilseeds franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. and as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. but as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention, hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from trans fat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years? and then i got a capital allocation question afterwards.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
adam, listen, we said it before, we feel very strongly about the future of our oilseeds business. it's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all these, and we were always waiting for the oil story. the oil story, i mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last eight years, if you will. so they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. we invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. we have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. so that's an advantage for us. and now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel.
so it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. and to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. these are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. and they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of -- and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. so continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe. but again, adam, very, very encouraged by all these developments and very happy for our strategic oilseeds business.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful, juan. and my second question is really on the balance sheet. maybe this is more for ray. and i'm just trying to think about kind of cash capital deployment from here. obviously, you have to be very sensitive to the increase in commodity prices and the impact that has on readily marketable inventories. but i mean impressively, your credit capacity has actually gone up on a year-on-year basis despite the rising in rmis. and so i'm just trying to think about what would it take to see cash return to shareholders or more aggressive or offensive m&a moving forward? it seems like there's a lot of underlying cash generation in the business, and it doesn't seem like we've got a clear kind of target of where it's going at the moment?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, adam, first of all, the balance sheet is what i consider one of the greatest assets of adm. and while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to march of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? and so i think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. it's not a surprise. commodity prices continue to go up right now. and so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. and -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. as you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace.
and so to the extent that there are distressed assets that makes sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. that's one of the big advantages of our adm balance sheet. so -- but we all know eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. and then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. but again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. that's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. but i'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's a really helpful color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, adam.

your next question comes from tom simonitsch of jpmorgan. your line is open.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, tom.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. hey. could you give us some more color around your -- how you're managing your crush assets this year compared to any other? to what extent are you locking in crush capacity for the next few quarters? and on the oil side, how are you approaching negotiations with potential renewable diesel customers versus your more traditional food customers?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i can say we have a reasonable visibility on the q2 for oilseeds as we have a book build. and we stay a little bit more open for the q3 and q4. that's probably to the extent that i will disclose. in terms of food versus oil customers, listen, we're staying close to both. of course, we provide -- we have long-term relationships with our food customers that -- we've been working with them through all these and educating them on this new demand that is coming. and we are forging new relationships with customers from renewable green diesel that, of course, the big issue for that industry is feedstock availability. so we're having a lot of discussions that range from the tactical to the strategic discussions with some of them as they decide on their future investments. so that's what i will describe the relationship.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then just a question on nutrition. i think you mentioned a shift in demand for texturants. can you provide some more color there?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've seen some softness in some of those segments. but i would say this is a little bit of a transition time in -- nutrition goes to so many applications, and depending on the geography, food services in some parts are coming back, and in some other parts, that's still delayed. so i would say, in general, and i'm very pleased actually, nutrition surpassed my own expectations this quarter by growing profitability by around 9% and revenue 5%. it was -- the demand recovery from covid and the impact of that in different markets is very uneven around the world as the world is getting access to vaccination at different rates.
so we are seeing that. so as i said, this was a quarter of, remember, investment in nutrition. so we were expecting results similar to last year. we end up delivering results that are 9% better than last year, so very happy with this. we had some specific pockets of softness, maybe some chewing gum kind of softness, some softness in some places in animal nutrition. but overall, very strong flavors, beverages, supplements, fibers, probiotics, specialty proteins. so the main trends remain there.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and maybe just one more question from me. if you wouldn't mind, could you share your house view of u.s. planted acres of corn versus beans?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say, in our view, given the early planting, the start that we have in the u.s., i think we have corn about 17%, and soybeans at about 8% at the moment. we believe that there's probably upside to the usda numbers. so we believe that by the next time usda will report acres, we're probably going to find maybe five more million acres combined between soy and corn kind of evenly split, if you will, give or take between the two.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

your next question comes from luke washer, bank of america. your line is open.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. good morning, everbody.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
hi luke.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey luke.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
so i wanted to touch on swimming oil a little bit. i know you've talked a little bit about renewable diesel trend. but have you seen soybean oil demand ramp this quarter relative to your expectations, perhaps at the beginning of this quarter? and is this largely driven by renewable diesel demand? or are you also seeing increased demand for edible oils? and is there any disruption that's happening with the prices where they are?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. listen, we continue to see strong demand. i think that as some restaurants and some places are reopening, we started to see food services coming back a little bit. to be honest, we saw that across the company, not only in soybean oil. i would say march orders were significantly better than january and february. and i think we see that continuing in april. so again, a -- recovery, but we can see that. i would say, of course, we knew when green diesel customers are starting to show in demand. so we see that increased demand. so in general, we see a strong demand. in terms of disruption of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. probably the only example i can pinpoint is brazil with biodiesel that reduced from b13 to b10.
that's probably the only thing you can say. things have become expensive, at least. and brazil, as i made -- as i've mentioned in my onset remarks, brazil is having a very difficult time with covid. so i think the overall economy is suffering. and i think the government is trying to alleviate some -- to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. so -- but that's probably the only example i can pinpoint to at this point of demand disruption.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
and then maybe one more on nutrition. can you talk about what's driving your confidence in the 15% cagr that you expect this year? what are the ways that you're driving operating profit margins higher? is this simply growing in higher-margin businesses? or are you doing cross-selling or any other actions you're taking? maybe just some of the puts and takes for this year.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, absolutely. listen, remember that the 15% came from -- we put together the 5-year plan. and when we see us achieving our target of $1 billion op basically by 2024, give or take, in order to get there, we need to grow 15%. so we were planning to start this -- and this year, it's not an exception to that. we plan 15%. when we started the year, we were planning to start the year, as i said, kind of flattish versus -- and the business continue to show strength. how that strength come part is revenue growth. part of my confidence is given by the pipeline. we have a strong pipeline. we are very -- the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer by customer and the projects. and that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow.
so those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by your customers. certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. and that allows us to increase profitability, even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. and there are different parts, well, for example, for flavors and for plant-based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. for parts like animal nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. and so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio. but that complexity also brings a lot of growth opportunities. and that's why we would have the confidence that it's a very balanced business from an opportunity perspective, supported by a very strong pipeline.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst

your next question comes from robert moskow of credit suisse. your line is open.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you and congratulations. i have a question about the crush margins in the quarter. i mean such an outstanding result. and i think you've mentioned that risk management or just execution played a role. if you look at spot margins during the quarter, just looking at board prices, they weren't nearly this good. but i've heard that you and others have been delivering results much better than that. so i guess my question is, can you explain why it's so different from what we see in the spot markets? and is this sustainable into 2q? or are there some unusual aspects of first quarter that we should know about?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, listen, it was a very clean quarter. there's nothing that you should know about other than cash crush margins remain very healthy. we have a strong product demand from both meal and specialty oil. and these margins remain considerably stronger than what board crush indicates, particularly in north america and europe. if you look at board crush in north america or europe per month is about $25 per ton, and then we see margins on a cash basis of around $40 per ton. so there is a significant difference there. i would say we see -- as i said before, we have reasonable visibility into q2 given the book of business we have. so we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there.
so i mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. softseed margins have been good. they moderated a little bit since q1, but they continue to be very good. so oil values continue to be strong. and demand for our customers in mill in north america, our customers are enjoying good margins at this point in time. so they are trying to produce as much as they can. so we see strong demand from both lakes of the crush. so we feel good about it at the moment.

i want to focus on -- with two questions on the carbohydrate solutions business, which was really, really solid in the quarter. and focusing first on those starches and the sweeteners business. to the extent you can, can you disaggregate the contribution from your ethanol production out of your wet mills versus the kind of core starches and sweeteners business? and on that starches and sweeteners business, were net corn cost a tailwind for you guys? i know you favorably hedged your gross corn costs in 4q. so i'm wondering kind of what the relationship between that hedged corn versus the strong co-product values delivered as it relates to your realized net corn costs?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, ben. so let me do a reverse order. so net corn cost was a tailwind for us. i mean clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. and hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. and hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. with respect to the question on that disaggregating starches and sweeteners from ethanol. my only comment is one of the big improvements in starches and sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter -- last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact.
if you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. we didn't have it this year. so that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. from a volume perspective, when you look at the starches and sweeteners business right now, we're still -- i'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. and corn syrup is still down versus last year. so we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the food service sector is not fully recovered. we indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of march. but from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? so therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. but we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year.
so i guess, overall, i mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. and frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
very good. okay. great. my second question is on vcp and your decision to restart your dry mills. we're seeing improving driving demand, gasoline demand off of kind of low this year and last year. i'm curious, though, we've seen production in the weekly eia numbers come out that have been a little bit lagging, i think, what might be expected when thinking about your facilities coming back online. can you help us think about your outlook for as much visibility as you have as it relates to ethanol smb? and when you think about the velocity of restarting your mills, what is your focus there? are you worried about that disrupting the smb and ethanol? to the extent you can give us any color on they have grown in the first three months of the year.
there are import of proteins that's up like 20%. and they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. so that's what we're seeing. of course, corn prices have been expensive in china. and so china has been taking as much as wheat as they can from europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. but they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. and during this year, we think that both corn reserves and wheat reserves needs to be replenished at one point in time. we don't think that that's happening now. nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. but we think that, that may happen later in the year. okay. and one, if i could just ask you a follow-up about your comments on sort of bio-based products that you made during your prepared remarks. were you just referring to sort of the existing initiatives around fdme and carb sol and spiber and acrylic acid or are there new things that you're looking at? or going back to some of the old stuff like pha or just -- what did you want to tell us about that, anything incremental?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that there is a portfolio of things. some of the ones you mentioned, we are not going back to pha. but there are some more in areas like construction or pharma or personal care. we continue to find customers that have application development capabilities, but they want to change their input. and instead of being natural gas on oil, they want it plant-based. and for that, listen, we have -- we stand on a great source of sugar, that is the carb solution business. we have fermentation technologies, and we have a good cost position here in the u.s. and as we have the capability, the critical mass. so i think that we are an attractive partner that everybody that is brainstorming or looking for a solution to match their sustainability targets is having discussions with our team. so there are some things that we cannot unveil right now, but we may unveil it over the course of the year.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
thanks very much.

your next question comes from michael piken of cleveland research. your line is open.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah. good morning, ray. i just wanted to talk a little bit about south america. maybe we could start with brazil and just -- it seems like there's been some weather issues with the safrinha crop. and just trying to understand how you see kind of your volumes and business shaping out in south america over the next couple of quarters? and if net-net, at this point, do we -- are we cheering for a bigger south american crop or a smaller south american crop with respect to your overall global footprint?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, michael. yes. south america, the weather in south america, of course, delayed a little bit the crop, and certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. we still expect -- traditionally, april and may are dry weather months in brazil. so that's not great for this, and that's what putting a little bit of the premium in -- the weather premium on corn. so we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. and brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. so that is an impact in the market. what are we rooting for? we are rooting for larger crops. we like to move crops. so the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons. so that's in check.
and i think what brazil is doing at the moment is maybe getting a little bit of corn from argentina. certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. because adjusted, as i said before, the b13 biodiesel to b10. so it's a year in which brazil needs to navigate with -- on very tight stocks. and so it's going to be a difficult year and a year of heavy management for the brazilian, the crush and the grain side of things.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then as a follow-up, just thinking ahead to 2022 with the projected growth in renewable biodiesel combined with a very -- or a tightening corn market. i mean how do you sort of see the acreage playing out in the u.s. for 2022 between corn and soybeans to meet this demand? and i guess from your perspective, i know you guys have some swing capacity, but the -- it seems like there's other crushing capacity up in canada. softseed, three of their competitors have announced expansions. how do you see kind of the margin environment working out if we need to plant more corn next year?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that, of course, the farmer react to pricing. and although this may be too late to shift a lot of acres to corn given how late we are already, i think, first of all, they will try to plant as much as possible next year as well, given prices will continue to be elevated. i think, listen, as it gets tied, the market, that's an advantage of our value chain. our procurement, our long value chain, the fact that we have such a good coverage of everywhere. in a tight market, that's where our footprint shines and we get the competitive advantage, if you will.
so we like to have more crops. but in periods in which crops are going to be tied, we have a good system to make sure we get our hands into the crops. and because of sometimes basis go up. but to be honest, given the strong demand and the good profitability of our customers, i think we will be able to price those in. so i think that we are looking constructively about in terms of margins for the future.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
and your thoughts on the acreage shift?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
it's too early to tell. and there are too many factors. i mean we are still trying to plant -- we haven't planted like 10% of our this crop, it's difficult to speculate about the 2022 crop.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from ben theurer of barclays. your line is open.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, juan, ray and thanks for taking my question.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
congrats on the results.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
two quick ones. so first of all, you gave a little bit of guidance into the different segments, but could you elaborate first on the ag service piece within aso, how you think about that turning into 2q and particularly in light what we're seeing in your appendix on the cumulative crush deferred timing gains? because i remember last call, you said the vast majority of the close to $300 million is likely to reverse within the first half. and we haven't seen much in 1q. so how do we think -- shall we think about those timing gains? and how shall we think about the underlying business within ag service in particular over the second quarter?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. for ag services, seasonally, q2 will be lower than q1, right? i mean that's what happens. i mean north america, we had a very strong q1 in terms of north american exports. again, partly as juan indicated, a delayed south american harvest. it allowed the export window in north america to really benefit. and then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. so second quarter for ag services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. the demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter.
on your question on timing differences, remember, this is crushing, right? i mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight. that will reverse over the course of the year. in the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. and just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had, at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. and the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. so some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects.
and so i just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year. so that's just my only caution i want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then just, ray, not pushing much here, but how do you think about the ag service on a year-over-year basis, not on a sequential basis, just compared to second quarter of last year because there was obviously a lot of things going on and some structure and some of the plans, just trying to understand how we should put the second quarter of '21 into contetxt with the second quarter of '20?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so in my prepared remarks, i did say that we'll likely going to have lower ag service results this year second quarter compared to last year, right? so i mean -- and don't forget, remember, last year, we were benefiting a lot from south america farmer selling, right? and that was extremely strong last year first quarter, but particularly second quarter. so we're not going to see that impact this year. so that's going to be the primary driver as to why ag services this year q2 will be lower than last year's q2.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you very much. i'll leave it here. thanks. congrats again.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from eric larson of seaport global securities. your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you and congratulations, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
hi, eric.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, eric.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i'll make it really quick. i have a couple of questions that -- one is a real near-term question, kind of exports over the next couple of quarters. the usda is way behind, i think, in what they're giving china credit for, for corn exports through the year, something like six million or seven million metric tons. and yet we're seeing the cash markets' futures are strong, but the cash markets are nothing short of astonishing. so are we trying to fill some of those on price, maybe china contracts from u.s. farmers? are they just holding back? i guess how tight really is the u.s. corn market? and we know the oil markets are really tight. canada is importing grade seeds from the ukraine. so we know that the north american oilseed markets are tight, but how tight is the u.s. corn market right now given cash prices?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes, eric, listen, we think, as i said before, that the u.s. continues to be competitive in the second quarter for corn exports. so we're going to see some of those exports. as ray was saying before, ag services probably elevation margin will not be the same because we won't have the same program of soybean on top of that. china continues to be buying everything they can. they are buying corn, but they're buying wheat, as i said before, from several places. and we have certain weather spots in the world. canada and france are too cold and too dry. that has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from the cyclone.
so the exportability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading, that has created some pressure. so for the moment, corn continues to be competitive. the u.s. is exporting corn. but pretty soon, it will become landed in china, a little bit more expensive than wheat. but then wheat is getting tighter because of the bad weather. so we are looking at all those dynamics. so it's very difficult to answer the spot question specifically, but that's what our team does all day, is looking at all those dynamics and making sure we alter our product flows to fit the best origin.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. yes. okay. well, china is playing every bushel of barley and sorghum and i think they're around the world everywhere.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
so the final question is a longer-term question that i'm really somewhat concerned about. we've seen the biden administration now talk about a 30% conservation plan, meaning they want to put 30% of u.s. -- of all u.s. land and 30% of all water into conservation programs. at the same time, increase the crp program. does that mean that we're in a land grab here? i know we're in early stages. does the fed buy land? do we encourage people to put it aside? does it take more farmland out of production, now at a time when we really actually need the production? how do you -- what are your initial reads of the biden's recently announced conservation plans?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. listen, i think the administration has shown from the beginning that, of course, fighting climate change was going to be one of their priorities, which we support, and we have a strong sustainability program. i think that we need to start working, and it's important to work very closely with the farmers to try to listen, to -- the farmer understand the responsibility. we have, at the moment, maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which i think will increase yield without needing more land. and i think that there will be a discussion with the administration, and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short-term feeding needs of the world.
the world needs the u.s. capacity as they need the brazilian capacity. so these prices show that we need those acres. so i think that this cannot be automatic. it's something that we will have to work out, balancing all the stakeholders, people that need the food with the long-term needs for conserving the planet.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
all right. thank you everyone.

i will now turn the call over to juan.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. this morning, i'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted op growth. our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual wacc and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period.
i'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. i'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. turn to slide four, please. first, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. from a geographic perspective, china was one of the first countries to emerge from covid-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. in the u.s. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. vaccine rollout has been slower in emea but is accelerating now.
and so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. of course, some countries like brazil and india are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. from a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. and we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. in summary, recovery from covid and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio.
please turn to slide five. another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the u.s. about a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in cedar rapids, iowa and columbus, nebraska. we committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. as we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on march 31. mobility and driving miles increasing as covid-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. support from the epa for the renewable fuel standard. and china resuming purchases of u.s. ethanol in the first half of 2021. with all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production.
at the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. from a portfolio management perspective, we're still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. and as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. slide six, please. one of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. in q1, our covantis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry.
similarly, in the u.s. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. we're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. in europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions.
we're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. last year, as travel was restricted, we launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities, including real-time tasting. now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. in march, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. and earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge, plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in singapore.
these new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. slide seven, please. finally, i want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. it includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. it encompasses our strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility, utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations in decatur, illinois.
sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan-derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. one critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. we joined the brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. and in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the brazilian cerrado. now we are taking our efforts to a new level. last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities.
as part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect south american soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. i'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. we know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. but more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. i'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy.
but now i'd like to turn the call over to ray, who will take us through our business performance. ray?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, juan. good morning, everyone. slide eight, please. the ag services and oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. ag services results were substantially higher year-over-year. results were driven by a record q1 for our north american origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong chinese demand. as expected, results in south america were significantly lower versus the prior year period. farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter.
lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected south american results. results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight positions. those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. while overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both north america and emea, refined oils.
global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. equity earnings from wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for ag services and oilseeds to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, driven by potentially record global demand for north american agricultural products. for the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger crushing and rpo expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower ag service results. slide nine, please. the carbohydrate solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth.
our starches and sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. the business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. in general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of march. starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. vantage corn processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in usp-grade industrial alcohol.
looking ahead, second quarter results for carbohydrate solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our two vcp dry mills and the recovery of the foodservice segment. slide 10, please. the nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. human nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages.
favorable product mix in north america, improved margins in emea and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. specialty ingredients results were lower, primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. health and wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products, driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. animal nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in south america. this was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix.
looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. slide 11, please. let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by more favorable adm investor services earnings. for the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for eps purposes, which are referenced in slide 24 in the appendix.
these adjustment items included: one, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against golden peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws; two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition; and three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the wilmar exchangeable bond. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year, due primarily to our continued investments in it and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations.
we are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. as expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. we still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion.
as part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another u.s. pension liability transfer transaction on april one with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the u.s. insurance market. this effectively reduces our u.s. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the u.s. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective.
with that, i'll turn it back to juan.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 12, please. i'm proud of the team for our great start to 2021. and i'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. we began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the three cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. we launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. we call that getting fit for the journey. once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on three core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results.
during this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, m&a and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on two strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level.
the productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or coes in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our one adm business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term.
we'll expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic m&a and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. we'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. and of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues.
as i look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, i'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. the demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. and we are delivering on our potential and our promise. that is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were three months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and eps versus our record 2020. and as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear covid recovery, will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come.
with that, chris, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal. your line is open.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
just want to touch base. you kind of -- your comment was -- which was actually really interesting, that you expect growth, sustainable growth for years to come. so with that, just a couple of points. one is, do you look at 2021 or 2020 as the base year from which you can grow? and then second, what are the key demand drivers that you see beyond 2021 that will continue to propel you? or is it more internal actions that would create the growth?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, ken. listen, as i was referring in my remarks, we see the future with a lot of optimism. i mean we think that fundamentally, we have, as you know, a strong agenda of both now productivity and innovation where there are things that we can control, that we drive under our control. and we've been executing a similar plan. so now you're going to see it strengthen. and it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. but all this is in the -- as supported by these three strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. so let me give you a little bit of flavor there.
we continue to see strong demand. you see food security, of course, as the global population grows. protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. and as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. we see that in china, we see that in the u.s. and we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. so that's in an environment, ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. so we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events.
and we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions. so products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. we have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. so again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply/demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
so 2020 or 2021, would you say, is your year from which we could start thinking about growth?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that we -- 2021, we're going to grow significantly versus 2020. so in 2021, we are establishing this sharpening again. so if you will, maybe we can reset to that level to 2021, and we start from here. we have a rolling five-year plan, as you know, ken, that we constantly update. and we constantly make it more robust, so we can deliver earnings growth year-over-year.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
great. i appreciate. thank you.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. your line is open.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. so i guess my first question, really just trying to think about the market environment a little bit, and obviously, a lot of crop currents happening at the moment. specifically, i want to think about on the oilseeds franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. and as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. but as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention, hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from trans fat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years? and then i got a capital allocation question afterwards.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
adam, listen, we said it before, we feel very strongly about the future of our oilseeds business. it's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all these, and we were always waiting for the oil story. the oil story, i mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last eight years, if you will. so they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. we invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. we have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. so that's an advantage for us. and now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel.
so it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. and to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. these are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. and they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of -- and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. so continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe. but again, adam, very, very encouraged by all these developments and very happy for our strategic oilseeds business.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful, juan. and my second question is really on the balance sheet. maybe this is more for ray. and i'm just trying to think about kind of cash capital deployment from here. obviously, you have to be very sensitive to the increase in commodity prices and the impact that has on readily marketable inventories. but i mean impressively, your credit capacity has actually gone up on a year-on-year basis despite the rising in rmis. and so i'm just trying to think about what would it take to see cash return to shareholders or more aggressive or offensive m&a moving forward? it seems like there's a lot of underlying cash generation in the business, and it doesn't seem like we've got a clear kind of target of where it's going at the moment?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, adam, first of all, the balance sheet is what i consider one of the greatest assets of adm. and while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to march of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? and so i think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. it's not a surprise. commodity prices continue to go up right now. and so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. and -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. as you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace.
and so to the extent that there are distressed assets that makes sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. that's one of the big advantages of our adm balance sheet. so -- but we all know eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. and then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. but again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. that's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. but i'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's a really helpful color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer

your next question comes from tom simonitsch of jpmorgan. your line is open.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, tom.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. hey. could you give us some more color around your -- how you're managing your crush assets this year compared to any other? to what extent are you locking in crush capacity for the next few quarters? and on the oil side, how are you approaching negotiations with potential renewable diesel customers versus your more traditional food customers?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i can say we have a reasonable visibility on the q2 for oilseeds as we have a book build. and we stay a little bit more open for the q3 and q4. that's probably to the extent that i will disclose. in terms of food versus oil customers, listen, we're staying close to both. of course, we provide -- we have long-term relationships with our food customers that -- we've been working with them through all these and educating them on this new demand that is coming. and we are forging new relationships with customers from renewable green diesel that, of course, the big issue for that industry is feedstock availability. so we're having a lot of discussions that range from the tactical to the strategic discussions with some of them as they decide on their future investments. so that's what i will describe the relationship.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then just a question on nutrition. i think you mentioned a shift in demand for texturants. can you provide some more color there?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've seen some softness in some of those segments. but i would say this is a little bit of a transition time in -- nutrition goes to so many applications, and depending on the geography, food services in some parts are coming back, and in some other parts, that's still delayed. so i would say, in general, and i'm very pleased actually, nutrition surpassed my own expectations this quarter by growing profitability by around 9% and revenue 5%. it was -- the demand recovery from covid and the impact of that in different markets is very uneven around the world as the world is getting access to vaccination at different rates.
so we are seeing that. so as i said, this was a quarter of, remember, investment in nutrition. so we were expecting results similar to last year. we end up delivering results that are 9% better than last year, so very happy with this. we had some specific pockets of softness, maybe some chewing gum kind of softness, some softness in some places in animal nutrition. but overall, very strong flavors, beverages, supplements, fibers, probiotics, specialty proteins. so the main trends remain there.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and maybe just one more question from me. if you wouldn't mind, could you share your house view of u.s. planted acres of corn versus beans?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say, in our view, given the early planting, the start that we have in the u.s., i think we have corn about 17%, and soybeans at about 8% at the moment. we believe that there's probably upside to the usda numbers. so we believe that by the next time usda will report acres, we're probably going to find maybe five more million acres combined between soy and corn kind of evenly split, if you will, give or take between the two.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

your next question comes from luke washer, bank of america. your line is open.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. good morning, everbody.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
hi luke.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey luke.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
so i wanted to touch on swimming oil a little bit. i know you've talked a little bit about renewable diesel trend. but have you seen soybean oil demand ramp this quarter relative to your expectations, perhaps at the beginning of this quarter? and is this largely driven by renewable diesel demand? or are you also seeing increased demand for edible oils? and is there any disruption that's happening with the prices where they are?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. listen, we continue to see strong demand. i think that as some restaurants and some places are reopening, we started to see food services coming back a little bit. to be honest, we saw that across the company, not only in soybean oil. i would say march orders were significantly better than january and february. and i think we see that continuing in april. so again, a -- recovery, but we can see that. i would say, of course, we knew when green diesel customers are starting to show in demand. so we see that increased demand. so in general, we see a strong demand. in terms of disruption of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. probably the only example i can pinpoint is brazil with biodiesel that reduced from b13 to b10.
that's probably the only thing you can say. things have become expensive, at least. and brazil, as i made -- as i've mentioned in my onset remarks, brazil is having a very difficult time with covid. so i think the overall economy is suffering. and i think the government is trying to alleviate some -- to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. so -- but that's probably the only example i can pinpoint to at this point of demand disruption.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
and then maybe one more on nutrition. can you talk about what's driving your confidence in the 15% cagr that you expect this year? what are the ways that you're driving operating profit margins higher? is this simply growing in higher-margin businesses? or are you doing cross-selling or any other actions you're taking? maybe just some of the puts and takes for this year.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, absolutely. listen, remember that the 15% came from -- we put together the 5-year plan. and when we see us achieving our target of $1 billion op basically by 2024, give or take, in order to get there, we need to grow 15%. so we were planning to start this -- and this year, it's not an exception to that. we plan 15%. when we started the year, we were planning to start the year, as i said, kind of flattish versus -- and the business continue to show strength. how that strength come part is revenue growth. part of my confidence is given by the pipeline. we have a strong pipeline. we are very -- the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer by customer and the projects. and that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow.
so those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by your customers. certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. and that allows us to increase profitability, even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. and there are different parts, well, for example, for flavors and for plant-based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. for parts like animal nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. and so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio. but that complexity also brings a lot of growth opportunities. and that's why we would have the confidence that it's a very balanced business from an opportunity perspective, supported by a very strong pipeline.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.

your next question comes from robert moskow of credit suisse. your line is open.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you and congratulations. i have a question about the crush margins in the quarter. i mean such an outstanding result. and i think you've mentioned that risk management or just execution played a role. if you look at spot margins during the quarter, just looking at board prices, they weren't nearly this good. but i've heard that you and others have been delivering results much better than that. so i guess my question is, can you explain why it's so different from what we see in the spot markets? and is this sustainable into 2q? or are there some unusual aspects of first quarter that we should know about?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, listen, it was a very clean quarter. there's nothing that you should know about other than cash crush margins remain very healthy. we have a strong product demand from both meal and specialty oil. and these margins remain considerably stronger than what board crush indicates, particularly in north america and europe. if you look at board crush in north america or europe per month is about $25 per ton, and then we see margins on a cash basis of around $40 per ton. so there is a significant difference there. i would say we see -- as i said before, we have reasonable visibility into q2 given the book of business we have. so we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there.
so i mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. softseed margins have been good. they moderated a little bit since q1, but they continue to be very good. so oil values continue to be strong. and demand for our customers in mill in north america, our customers are enjoying good margins at this point in time. so they are trying to produce as much as they can. so we see strong demand from both lakes of the crush. so we feel good about it at the moment.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

your next question comes from ben bienvenu of stephens. your line is open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hi. good morning, everybody.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
i want to focus on -- with two questions on the carbohydrate solutions business, which was really, really solid in the quarter. and focusing first on those starches and the sweeteners business. to the extent you can, can you disaggregate the contribution from your ethanol production out of your wet mills versus the kind of core starches and sweeteners business? and on that starches and sweeteners business, were net corn cost a tailwind for you guys? i know you favorably hedged your gross corn costs in 4q. so i'm wondering kind of what the relationship between that hedged corn versus the strong co-product values delivered as it relates to your realized net corn costs?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, ben. so let me do a reverse order. so net corn cost was a tailwind for us. i mean clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. and hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. and hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. with respect to the question on that disaggregating starches and sweeteners from ethanol. my only comment is one of the big improvements in starches and sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter -- last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact.
if you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. we didn't have it this year. so that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. from a volume perspective, when you look at the starches and sweeteners business right now, we're still -- i'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. and corn syrup is still down versus last year. so we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the food service sector is not fully recovered. we indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of march. but from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? so therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. but we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year.
so i guess, overall, i mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. and frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
very good. okay. great. my second question is on vcp and your decision to restart your dry mills. we're seeing improving driving demand, gasoline demand off of kind of low this year and last year. i'm curious, though, we've seen production in the weekly eia numbers come out that have been a little bit lagging, i think, what might be expected when thinking about your facilities coming back online. can you help us think about your outlook for as much visibility as you have as it relates to ethanol smb? and when you think about the velocity of restarting your mills, what is your focus there? are you worried about that disrupting the smb and ethanol? to the extent you can give us any color on they have grown in the first three months of the year.
there are import of proteins that's up like 20%. and they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. so that's what we're seeing. of course, corn prices have been expensive in china. and so china has been taking as much as wheat as they can from europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. but they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. and during this year, we think that both corn reserves and wheat reserves needs to be replenished at one point in time. we don't think that that's happening now. nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. but we think that, that may happen later in the year. okay. and one, if i could just ask you a follow-up about your comments on sort of bio-based products that you made during your prepared remarks. were you just referring to sort of the existing initiatives around fdme and carb sol and spiber and acrylic acid or are there new things that you're looking at? or going back to some of the old stuff like pha or just -- what did you want to tell us about that, anything incremental?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that there is a portfolio of things. some of the ones you mentioned, we are not going back to pha. but there are some more in areas like construction or pharma or personal care. we continue to find customers that have application development capabilities, but they want to change their input. and instead of being natural gas on oil, they want it plant-based. and for that, listen, we have -- we stand on a great source of sugar, that is the carb solution business. we have fermentation technologies, and we have a good cost position here in the u.s. and as we have the capability, the critical mass. so i think that we are an attractive partner that everybody that is brainstorming or looking for a solution to match their sustainability targets is having discussions with our team. so there are some things that we cannot unveil right now, but we may unveil it over the course of the year.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
thanks very much.

your next question comes from michael piken of cleveland research. your line is open.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah. good morning, ray. i just wanted to talk a little bit about south america. maybe we could start with brazil and just -- it seems like there's been some weather issues with the safrinha crop. and just trying to understand how you see kind of your volumes and business shaping out in south america over the next couple of quarters? and if net-net, at this point, do we -- are we cheering for a bigger south american crop or a smaller south american crop with respect to your overall global footprint?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, michael. yes. south america, the weather in south america, of course, delayed a little bit the crop, and certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. we still expect -- traditionally, april and may are dry weather months in brazil. so that's not great for this, and that's what putting a little bit of the premium in -- the weather premium on corn. so we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. and brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. so that is an impact in the market. what are we rooting for? we are rooting for larger crops. we like to move crops. so the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons. so that's in check.
and i think what brazil is doing at the moment is maybe getting a little bit of corn from argentina. certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. because adjusted, as i said before, the b13 biodiesel to b10. so it's a year in which brazil needs to navigate with -- on very tight stocks. and so it's going to be a difficult year and a year of heavy management for the brazilian, the crush and the grain side of things.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then as a follow-up, just thinking ahead to 2022 with the projected growth in renewable biodiesel combined with a very -- or a tightening corn market. i mean how do you sort of see the acreage playing out in the u.s. for 2022 between corn and soybeans to meet this demand? and i guess from your perspective, i know you guys have some swing capacity, but the -- it seems like there's other crushing capacity up in canada. softseed, three of their competitors have announced expansions. how do you see kind of the margin environment working out if we need to plant more corn next year?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that, of course, the farmer react to pricing. and although this may be too late to shift a lot of acres to corn given how late we are already, i think, first of all, they will try to plant as much as possible next year as well, given prices will continue to be elevated. i think, listen, as it gets tied, the market, that's an advantage of our value chain. our procurement, our long value chain, the fact that we have such a good coverage of everywhere. in a tight market, that's where our footprint shines and we get the competitive advantage, if you will.
so we like to have more crops. but in periods in which crops are going to be tied, we have a good system to make sure we get our hands into the crops. and because of sometimes basis go up. but to be honest, given the strong demand and the good profitability of our customers, i think we will be able to price those in. so i think that we are looking constructively about in terms of margins for the future.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
and your thoughts on the acreage shift?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
it's too early to tell. and there are too many factors. i mean we are still trying to plant -- we haven't planted like 10% of our this crop, it's difficult to speculate about the 2022 crop.

ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
two quick ones. so first of all, you gave a little bit of guidance into the different segments, but could you elaborate first on the ag service piece within aso, how you think about that turning into 2q and particularly in light what we're seeing in your appendix on the cumulative crush deferred timing gains? because i remember last call, you said the vast majority of the close to $300 million is likely to reverse within the first half. and we haven't seen much in 1q. so how do we think -- shall we think about those timing gains? and how shall we think about the underlying business within ag service in particular over the second quarter?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. for ag services, seasonally, q2 will be lower than q1, right? i mean that's what happens. i mean north america, we had a very strong q1 in terms of north american exports. again, partly as juan indicated, a delayed south american harvest. it allowed the export window in north america to really benefit. and then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. so second quarter for ag services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. the demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter.
on your question on timing differences, remember, this is crushing, right? i mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight. that will reverse over the course of the year. in the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. and just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had, at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. and the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. so some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects.
and so i just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year. so that's just my only caution i want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then just, ray, not pushing much here, but how do you think about the ag service on a year-over-year basis, not on a sequential basis, just compared to second quarter of last year because there was obviously a lot of things going on and some structure and some of the plans, just trying to understand how we should put the second quarter of '21 into contetxt with the second quarter of '20?

yes. so in my prepared remarks, i did say that we'll likely going to have lower ag service results this year second quarter compared to last year, right? so i mean -- and don't forget, remember, last year, we were benefiting a lot from south america farmer selling, right? and that was extremely strong last year first quarter, but particularly second quarter. so we're not going to see that impact this year. so that's going to be the primary driver as to why ag services this year q2 will be lower than last year's q2.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you very much. i'll leave it here. thanks. congrats again.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from eric larson of seaport global securities. your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you and congratulations, everyone.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
hi, eric.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, eric.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i'll make it really quick. i have a couple of questions that -- one is a real near-term question, kind of exports over the next couple of quarters. the usda is way behind, i think, in what they're giving china credit for, for corn exports through the year, something like six million or seven million metric tons. and yet we're seeing the cash markets' futures are strong, but the cash markets are nothing short of astonishing. so are we trying to fill some of those on price, maybe china contracts from u.s. farmers? are they just holding back? i guess how tight really is the u.s. corn market? and we know the oil markets are really tight. canada is importing grade seeds from the ukraine. so we know that the north american oilseed markets are tight, but how tight is the u.s. corn market right now given cash prices?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes, eric, listen, we think, as i said before, that the u.s. continues to be competitive in the second quarter for corn exports. so we're going to see some of those exports. as ray was saying before, ag services probably elevation margin will not be the same because we won't have the same program of soybean on top of that. china continues to be buying everything they can. they are buying corn, but they're buying wheat, as i said before, from several places. and we have certain weather spots in the world. canada and france are too cold and too dry. that has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from the cyclone.
so the exportability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading, that has created some pressure. so for the moment, corn continues to be competitive. the u.s. is exporting corn. but pretty soon, it will become landed in china, a little bit more expensive than wheat. but then wheat is getting tighter because of the bad weather. so we are looking at all those dynamics. so it's very difficult to answer the spot question specifically, but that's what our team does all day, is looking at all those dynamics and making sure we alter our product flows to fit the best origin.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. yes. okay. well, china is playing every bushel of barley and sorghum and i think they're around the world everywhere.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
eric larson -- seaport global securities -- analyst
so the final question is a longer-term question that i'm really somewhat concerned about. we've seen the biden administration now talk about a 30% conservation plan, meaning they want to put 30% of u.s. -- of all u.s. land and 30% of all water into conservation programs. at the same time, increase the crp program. does that mean that we're in a land grab here? i know we're in early stages. does the fed buy land? do we encourage people to put it aside? does it take more farmland out of production, now at a time when we really actually need the production? how do you -- what are your initial reads of the biden's recently announced conservation plans?
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. listen, i think the administration has shown from the beginning that, of course, fighting climate change was going to be one of their priorities, which we support, and we have a strong sustainability program. i think that we need to start working, and it's important to work very closely with the farmers to try to listen, to -- the farmer understand the responsibility. we have, at the moment, maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which i think will increase yield without needing more land. and i think that there will be a discussion with the administration, and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short-term feeding needs of the world.
the world needs the u.s. capacity as they need the brazilian capacity. so these prices show that we need those acres. so i think that this cannot be automatic. it's something that we will have to work out, balancing all the stakeholders, people that need the food with the long-term needs for conserving the planet.
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
all right. thank you everyone.

operator
good morning. welcome to the adm first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to introduce your host for today's call, victoria de la huerga, vice president, investor relations for adm. ms. de la huerga, you may begin.

i will now turn the call over to juan.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, victoria. this morning, i'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted op growth. our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual wacc and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period.
i'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. i'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. turn to slide four, please. first, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. from a geographic perspective, china was one of the first countries to emerge from covid-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. in the u.s. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. vaccine rollout has been slower in emea but is accelerating now.
and so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. of course, some countries like brazil and india are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. from a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. and we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. in summary, recovery from covid and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio.
please turn to slide five. another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the u.s. about a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in cedar rapids, iowa and columbus, nebraska. we committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. as we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on march 31. mobility and driving miles increasing as covid-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. support from the epa for the renewable fuel standard. and china resuming purchases of u.s. ethanol in the first half of 2021. with all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production.
at the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. from a portfolio management perspective, we're still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. and as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. slide six, please. one of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. in q1, our covantis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry.
similarly, in the u.s. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. we're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. in europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions.
we're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. last year, as travel was restricted, we launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities, including real-time tasting. now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. in march, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. and earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge, plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in singapore.
these new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. slide seven, please. finally, i want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. it includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. it encompasses our strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility, utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations in decatur, illinois.
sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan-derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. one critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. we joined the brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. and in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the brazilian cerrado. now we are taking our efforts to a new level. last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities.
as part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect south american soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. i'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. we know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. but more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. i'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy.
but now i'd like to turn the call over to ray, who will take us through our business performance. ray?
ray guy young -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, juan. good morning, everyone. slide eight, please. the ag services and oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. ag services results were substantially higher year-over-year. results were driven by a record q1 for our north american origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong chinese demand. as expected, results in south america were significantly lower versus the prior year period. farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter.
lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected south american results. results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight positions. those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. while overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both north america and emea, refined oils.
global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. equity earnings from wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for ag services and oilseeds to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, driven by potentially record global demand for north american agricultural products. for the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger crushing and rpo expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower ag service results. slide nine, please. the carbohydrate solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth.
our starches and sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. the business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. in general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of march. starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. vantage corn processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in usp-grade industrial alcohol.
looking ahead, second quarter results for carbohydrate solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our two vcp dry mills and the recovery of the foodservice segment. slide 10, please. the nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. human nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages.
favorable product mix in north america, improved margins in emea and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. specialty ingredients results were lower, primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. health and wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products, driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. animal nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in south america. this was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix.
looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. slide 11, please. let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by more favorable adm investor services earnings. for the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for eps purposes, which are referenced in slide 24 in the appendix.
these adjustment items included: one, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against golden peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws; two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition; and three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the wilmar exchangeable bond. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year, due primarily to our continued investments in it and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations.
we are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. as expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. we still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion.
as part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another u.s. pension liability transfer transaction on april one with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the u.s. insurance market. this effectively reduces our u.s. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the u.s. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective.
with that, i'll turn it back to juan.
juan ricardo luciano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 12, please. i'm proud of the team for our great start to 2021. and i'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. we began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the three cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. we launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. we call that getting fit for the journey. once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on three core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results.
during this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, m&a and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on two strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level.
the productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or coes in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our one adm business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term.
we'll expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic m&a and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. we'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. and of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues.
as i look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, i'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. the demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. and we are delivering on our potential and our promise. that is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were three months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and eps versus our record 2020. and as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear covid recovery, will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come.
with that, chris, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question is from adam samuelson of goldman sachs.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you, and good morning, everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
ray young -- chief financial officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i want -- maybe just something you just mentioned in the prepared remarks the $4 to $4.50 baseline of eps this year and the high single-digit growth thereafter just to be clear is that -- should we take that as a reasonably formal eps range for 2021 just given the performance year-to-date? i just want to clarify just, how we're framing that.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, adam. listen, when we were -- when we put together the previous phase of the strategy, we were looking at growing as i said before from $3 to land in the $4 to $4.50 area and achieve 10% roic. as we started to see those goals in sight, we started on the development of the new phase of the strategy. so, we took that base of $4 to $4.50 and we created a five-year plan. when we put together that plan, with all these opportunities that i highlighted and focused on productivity and innovation, that plan shows that from that base of $4 to $4.50 will grow over the next five years at the rate of high single-digit growth per year. so that's what we said in the -- at the outlook. hello? are we still on the line?
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i'm sorry. and then, just a market macro question, if i may. just, we've seen some volatility in oilseed crush margins around the world of late. it seems like, especially, in china, the soy meal demand has waned a little bit, with the wheat substitution and it seems like the global industry is really crushing for veg oil, given all the rd demand around the world. can you just help us think about kind of how that rolls forward, as we think, especially with -- for you more heavily weighted toward soybeans and some pressure in terms of softseed crop availability on the oil side, as we go through the balance of the year and into 2022?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thank you, adam. so, listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crush for the rest of the year and into next year. and if i go by geography, as i always do, from a north american perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in north america in the $45 to $50 range. as you said, with a strong vegetable oil demand, in part driven by rgd, but we had already a very good oil demand and we see more recovery of our foodservices and more reopening of the economy. and that continues to enhance, of course, the oil share of the crush contribution. and also, the tightening supplies and logistical issues in south america are allowing also u.s. soybean meal to be a little bit more competitive in global markets. we see some compression in european soy margins, maybe to $10 to $20, as prices basically from south america oil imports are pressuring crush margins, especially this is the time of the year in which argentina and brazil are the most competitive. they are in the middle of the harvest. and of course they have reduced their biodiesel mandate, so there is more oil exportable, if you will.
although, the beauty of our long supply chain is that, as crush margins have softened in europe, we got the benefit in biodiesel and the rpv given that. brazil margins continue to remain solid for domestic plants, with maybe $25 to $35, despite the b10 biodiesel situation. and they are expected to remain solid as they move to higher b12 blend rates in the future starting i think in september. china margins are low due to high bean prices and lower soybean in demand. the herd is going through a rebalance there. and at the moment, there is a lot of wheat feed being fed. and -- but we're going to go through the harvest of wheat. and i think that's something that we see with optimism going forward is that, if you look at all the substitutes that we were facing last year whether it was sorghum or canola or sun or wheat, they have increased their inclusion in the russians. and now all those things are having either weather issues or which is going to go through the harvest. so we see now the ability of soybean meal and corn inclusions to go up and that's positive as we go forward.
as you mentioned on our watch list is canola margins. they have weakened. they were very strong in the first -- during the first half and -- but they have weakened on concern of a short drop, driven by the dryness in canada. and canola margins are probably going to remain volatile until there is more certainty around the canadian crop side. so, two factors that we feel good about here is how valuable our switch capacity is, in this dynamic environment margins have shifted. and also how important it is our integration our long value chain. if you think north america today is capturing it in crush and maybe less so in biodiesel in europe, we don't capture that much in crush, but we capture it in biodiesel. so, all this ability of our footprint to allow us to follow the margin, as it moves through the value chain has been very, very beneficial in these very volatile times.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's incredibly helpful color. thanks so much. i'll pass it on.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
adam, maybe on the first question that you mentioned, again, the $4 to $4.50, as i said before, just to clarify, is our baseline in which we ran the exercise, because that was the landing spot of our previous strategy. and it's not a forecast or guidance for this year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it, that's helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question is from ben theurer of barclays.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ray young -- chief financial officer
hi, ben. ben, are you on the line?
operator
we'll go to the next questioner. your next question is from luke washer of bank of america.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good morning.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, luke.
ray young -- chief financial officer
good morning, luke.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
so, i wanted to ask you a few quick questions on your carbon capture projects. i think they're really interesting. are you getting any 45q tax credits, for the implementation of that technology? and now that it appears that it's commercially viable, do you intend to start the permitting process or working with other partners to build out and start capturing carbon at some of the other plants?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. so the answer is, yes, to both. so we have a big permit for decatur that we plan to of course leverage. and then, yes, we are exploring our ability to do so for other plants. we've been doing this relatively quietly, luke since 2017. and as i said before, we have stored more than 3.5 million tons, safely underground. and this gives us the ability to start differentiating our products that we can assign some of the credits to some of these products and have those products be deemed low-carbon intensity product. so we have again, a big experience. we've been doing this for four years, in two different facilities. and we feel very good about the future. and this is going to be a growing part of our operations, for sure.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
and maybe just a quick follow-up on that, it -- this does lower the carbon score -- the carbon -- the ci scores of your plants, right?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
that's correct.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
okay.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. and then, maybe just a more short-term question on carb solutions, it looks like you really did well this quarter, particularly relative to expectations earlier this year. so can you talk through the -- i guess, the delta in your expectations and how things progress through the quarter? and maybe talk through the $90 million in positioning gains that you had? and then, you also talked about normalized results for corn oil. corn oil prices are really high right now. so are you saying that that is a bit of a new normal, because of renewable diesel? any other color there would be great.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. let me tell you why -- what -- one better if you will, as per your question. i think that this was the quarter that we needed to restart the ethanol dry mills that we have taken down, due to lack of demand. and we have from a technical perspective the perfect start-up. and certainly, they hit the ground with better margins than maybe we anticipated before bringing them up. second, as we explained before, we have very good risk management that the team positioned very well on corn and on the ethanol complex. and certainly sweeteners volumes came back versus last year, as customers were preparing for the summer. and to a certain degree you might have to take both q2 and q3 together from a sweetener perspective, because i think that a lot of customers bought in anticipation of refilling their pipeline given the summer and the openness with covid that we will go into experience in the u.s. so it was a strong volume month as well.
ray young -- chief financial officer
it's going to -- on your question on corn oil, we've seen convergence of corn oil with soybean oil again. recall last year, we saw a divergence because of the snack foods people staying at home high demand for corn oil, which is used for frying that caused corn oil prices to move up dramatically and it diverged from soybean oil and that's what's caused a lot of the mark-to-market issues that we had last year. we've worked through all those issues over the course of the period. we're actually seeing right now corn oil and soybean oil really converging. and so we're turning back to, let's say, the normal relationship that we've seen in the past.

your next question is from ken zaslow of bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
ray young -- chief financial officer
hi, ken.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
hi, ken. good morning.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
you keep on tempting us with this productivity and innovation. can you put some color in terms of quantification on how much this is going to create in not just 2021, but beyond that and how do you frame those two opportunities?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. ken, i would say, if you look at our past what we have been doing over the last five years probably -- and if you think about translating everything we've done in productivity and innovation we were probably two-third in productivity and one-third in innovation if you will of all the savings we were getting. as we look at as i said before at our plan going forward, the contribution between productivity and innovation is equal. it's about 50-50. and it's mainly driven by all these opportunities that i mentioned not only nutrition, but all the other things that we're seeing whether it's biomaterials or renewable green diesel and all the other things that we've done. again, when we look at our plan, when we start from this again theoretical $4 to $4.50 range and we apply all these projects that are included in productivity and innovation we see our program over the next five years growing in the high single-digit percentage every year in operating profit. so we feel very good about that.
we will be having ken in q4 an investor day where we will be disclosing much more details and much more granularity about all these. but you can see some of the things that we're doing already whether we are invested in spiritwood or the acquisition of sojaprotein or the expansions of our plant in valencia with biopolis and microbiome. so, all these areas are receiving organic growth dollars. this will be -- as we go forward ken and you look at this plan this is more an investment plan than maybe the previous period was. so you will see a little bit more capex and a little bit more investment given the size of the opportunities. when i was mentioning some of the sizes of these addressable markets we have if you added some of the things i was saying these are markets north of $300 billion in which we have positioned ourselves very, very well and we think that we're going to capture a nice share of those. so the opportunity ahead of us is significant.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
let me just follow on. when you're thinking about the high single-digit growth rate to what extent do you think that is associated with the improvement in -- or the structural improvement in rd over the next couple of years? and how much of that is internally creative?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. let me say, when i look at the three businesses and we move them forward through the five years we see ag services and oilseeds growth moderately, but it grows. we see carb solutions being flat to slightly declining in our forecasting. and then we see a strong growth in nutrition. that's kind of the -- if you will the algorithm of how the business has moved. the ag services and oilseeds part -- part of that has been our own improvement, part of that has been the industry. there has been some consolidations and the industry margins are strong. and there has been a strong demand and we trust that there's going to continue to be a strong demand. there are 400 million people in the middle class in china that are consuming very much like us type of consumer. and that's driving health and wellness, that's driving improving diets.
and then, there is sustainability that is driving a lot of the things that we're doing, not only rgd, because remember that before rgd, we were already having a very tight oil market based on food, on food oil. so, i think part is our structural issues and part is our own improvements that we have done over these years.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
thank you very much.

your next question is from michael piken of cleveland research.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yes. good morning. maybe we can dive a little bit deeper into nutrition, and it seems like that's a good chunk of where the increase came from. but maybe this 20% growth rate, should we expect for 2022 to expect 15% year-on-year growth from -- on top of this 20% level? and then also, what categories are you seeing the most growth in besides plant protein? thanks.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. michael, listen, when we look forward on nutrition. nutrition is going to grow somewhere in that range, between 15% and 20%. so, we said, 15% this year and half into the year we have moved into 20%; so something in that range. the business is going very strong. we've been able to grow that revenue during this quarter and we've been able to maintain margins, which it has been a very good job of controlling gross margins and ebitda margin on sales. our enthusiasm is not only for the categories in which we are positioned, but also on the win rates and the customer engagement. our customer engagement as of -- in 2021 have doubled our customer engagement last year. and as the economy is reopening and foodservice become more active, customers are more willing to launch new promotions and new products, something that they were not doing before. so, we see that acceleration, whether it's in beverages or in health and wellness or alternative proteins. so again, i think you should think conservatively 15% per year; more aggressively 20% per year. but in that range, we will be growing over the next few years.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then, a follow-up question just shifting gears. could you talk about the impact of the recent kind of supreme court ruling? and there's been some talks about possible changes to the renewable fuel standard. maybe your thoughts on the growth potential or lack thereof for the us ethanol market moving forward in light of some of these policy uncertainties? thanks.
ray young -- chief financial officer
yes, mike. yes, there's been a lot of news regarding the recent supreme court ruling and some of the comments from the epa. when you kind of cut through all the headlines, and try to understand like what's fundamentally happening, we still believe the biden administration and the epa is committed to fighting climate change and also decarbonizing the economy. and biofuels, frankly, is in a very important part of that agenda. so, the biden administration has made it very clear that they don't intend to grant sres or these small refinery exemptions like in the prior administrations. and as president biden himself has said, he said that we should be insisting not exempting. so, we do expect the biden epa to take a very balanced approach toward granting future sres. so, when you look at supply demand balances going forward and you take a look at the rins balances and you think about the recovery of driving miles as we move through the pandemic, our expectation is looking at supply/demand for ethanol -- for gasoline and then which translates to ethanol, we believe that it is going to result in a reasonably constructive ethanol environment for the industry over the medium-term.
now, at the same time, mike it is important to note that in the case of our -- we've made a strategic decision to monetize our dry mills. and so, we kind of halted that process during the pandemic frankly, because ethanol demand was very weak. but during that period, we did look at alternatives. we took advantage to, frankly, explore other options. and there's -- frankly, as juan talked about on the issue of sustainability, there's growing interest in sustainable materials and sustainable solutions. and it appears that there may be some opportunities for us to explore non-vehicle uses of ethanol and leveraging ethanol as a sustainable feedstock for other products. and so, one of the promising areas is the sustainable aviation fuel, saf. with the airline industry moving toward effectively a low-carbon or a net-zero future, saf appears to be an important component of how they will get there. and just for perspective, the us airline industry before the pandemic consumed 30 billion gallons of aviation fuel a year. so we are looking at the possibility of leveraging our decatur carbon sequestration site, which juan talked about, with our corn processing output as a feedstock for saf to get toward a low-carbon saf product.
so, in addition to looking at potential monetization of dry mills, we are looking at the saf concept, which frankly may give us another option for finding another use of the dry mills and then taking those ethanol gallons off the vehicle market.

our next question is from tom simonitsch of jpmorgan.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, tom.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning, everyone. hi. so following up on the sojaprotein acquisition yesterday, can you provide some more color around how your strategy for alternative proteins varies by region?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i think that the strategy in specialty proteins is stay close to our customers and match up with capabilities and supply this market that is growing very fast. the market is growing north of 10% per year. so -- and it's moving fast in terms of the products. the products are continued to be improved every quarter. so we have a strong position in north america, our heritage position in soy derivatives. then we build our position in south america, which is very strong. i remind you that that was $0.25 billion investment so significant. then we build pea protein capacity in north dakota. and now we're expanding that capacity to europe. we have a small capacity in europe. now with this, we have bought -- we have acquired the largest producer in europe, which again has a great footprint of -- in the middle of the non-gmo soybean harvest area but also it has a very nice set of products and they sell to 65 different countries in many, many applications. so we continue to build the capabilities. this will not be the last one that you're going to hear in terms of announcements for specialty protein. again, this is -- these are early days but it's a fast-growing market in which we have a leadership position and we pretend to -- we intend to expand.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
that's helpful. and a question on china. the usda cut its china soybean import forecast this month. what are you assuming for that trade in the near to medium term? and how would it impact your crushing footprint?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. listen, i think that we are maybe more optimistic about china medium-term than maybe with the news are giving right now. china has done an exceptional job of controlling covid. and as such, they have recovered from that very successfully. so there is a lot of economic activity and hence demand. they have done a terrific job in coming back from the asf pandemic. they have recovered. so they have the consumer and they have the animals to actually consume. of course, they are very strategic in their purchases. and right now, it's not the time to be buying a lot of beans because beans are expensive and there is a crop in the us coming. and we think that that's where -- when they're going to come. you also have to remember a couple of things, tom. over the last two or three weeks, we lost 15 million tons of production around the world due to weather issues. whether it was the drought in canada with -- that impacted canola and wheat, whether it was russia, whether it was the impact was on sand and in wheat and whether it was the corn crop in brazil because of drought, all these products are competitive products in the russian to soybean meal. so those products will not be available to compete with soybean meal which will give soybean meal a higher inclusion in the ration.
and in our estimate given the small canola crop in canada, we think that china will have to probably import 2 million tons of extra soybean -- soybeans to offset that canola gap that they have right now. so all in all we feel that we're still going to have strong exports -- export volumes in the q4 of this year from north america.
tom simonitsch -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. i will pass it on.

your next question is from robert moskow of credit suisse.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. i had a question about the new earnings base that you're putting out there. historically external factors can change quickly and can have a big impact on your earnings. and i want to know, what do we have to believe about the external environment to feel comfort that the earnings base is credible that it can -- that you can achieve -- that the earnings base is achievable under a variety of different external environments.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. rob, the way we thought about it when we put together the plan is and i think i expressed some of that before is of course we look at the things that we can see into the future. you can argue the magnitude but we give our forecast forward and we add inflation to that. and we say some of these things may come back to the middle if you will or reverse to the means or whatever you want to call it. so, let's put the negative side there. so, we consider some of that. and then we look at our productivity and innovation and we said, can we build a robust enough agenda in productivity and innovation that actually can offset some of those headwinds whether they are headwinds on ethanol or whether they are whatever your favorite crush margin into the future or whether it's inflation?
and we look at that and the result of that exercise is that productivity and innovation earnings stream coming forward offset all that potential decline that we have estimated and offset it and giving us a result that high single-digit growth rate in profits over the next five years. so that's the way we think about it. so this is not a scenario in which everything goes perfect and margins are at peak level for five years. in our scenario margins normalize we have inflation and then we are able to offset a lot of that through growth and through productivity. that's what we are saying in terms of our new base.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
right. and in terms of things that are going to normalize carbohydrates would be the first -- the most -- the biggest degree of normalization because it looks like it's going to earn $1 billion this year?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes. i would say, maybe when i was answering ken i think when we look at the three businesses, nutrition provides a lot of the growth in that scenario of course. you have to remember, when we started reporting nutrition yearly they were reporting about $300-and-something million. this quarter they crossed the barrier of $200 million. so now -- so it's significant. and you will see that in crescendo of course over the next few years as we reach $1 billion and beyond. carb solutions as you said is -- it basically declines over the period. and then we have a healthy, but not exuberant growth rate for ag services and oilseeds. so all in all, when you look at our numbers it doesn't look a far-fetched scenario. on the contrary it's a scenario that we're very confident that's why we are making it public today. and a lot of things under our control to be honest.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
and last question. you said that there's been consolidation in the soy crush industry and that is part of the reason for your confidence. but you are opening up a new crush plant now. can you give a little more color about how much consolidation there's been? what do you think crush capacity looks like today compared to a few years ago? and where do you think it's going in the next few years from an industry perspective?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. listen i think that there has been consolidation in the small regional players, which has been important. we have the example of algar in brazil. we also did the soybean joint venture with cargill in egypt. so -- and there have been others around the industry. i think it's important to notice that we've been working in this expansion, the spiritwood for the last two years. we just announced it now. but this is capacity that, of course, this one is helped by rgd. but when you think about soybean meal in north america, we need about two to three -- to offset -- 2% to 3% growth in demand every year. so we need a full-time full-fledged plant every couple of years just to keep up with demand and to be able to supply the growth. so we don't think that any of these build is excessive. on the contrary, we think that it's needed to allow demand to be fulfilled.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.

in the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question. again, please limit yourself to one question
your next question is from ben theurer of barclays.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
great. good morning, juan, ray, now we try it again. thank you very much, and congrats on the results.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning ben.
ray young -- chief financial officer
morning ben.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
just one question. if you could elaborate a little bit on those $90 million on positioning gains across ethanol and what's been driving that throughout the quarter. and is that something you think is something recurring, is this a one-off? how should we think about it because it was obviously sizable within the segment? thank you.
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah, ben. i mean our team's do an excellent job managing risk, right? and when you just talk about managing risk is both managing the risks of the inputs and the outputs. and so the positioning gains that we had in the quarter, in the second quarter, the $90 million it's a combination of what i call the ethanol complex, right? so it's a combination of how they're managing the corn, how they're managing ethanol, how they're managing rins, all these positions.
and as you know it was a very volatile quarter when you looked at the prices of corn and ethanol and rins but they managed exceptionally well. and so $90 million normally they would generate risk management gains. we highlighted it this quarter because this was an exceptional quarter. and by the way it wasn't just an exceptional quarter. it was an exceptional first half of the year, because when you take a look at the first half of the year, they probably had positioning gains roughly with a similar amount in the first quarter as well. so, therefore, the carb solutions team really hit all of the ballpark in terms of risk management in the first half of this year.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
so for the future we should expect some of it, but maybe not at the same magnitude. that's a fair assumption?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, again i mean i would never ask the carb solutions team to hold back. but again they will always manage their positions exceedingly well. and i would say this was probably an exceptional performance for the first half of the year.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay, perfect. i'll leave it here. thank you very much for squeezing me in again.
ray young -- chief financial officer

your next question is from vincent andrews of morgan stanley.
steve haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is steve haynes on for vincent. maybe i could just squeeze a quick one in on the biosolutions business portfolio. you talked about some of the other growth things. and you've announced -- you've made some announcements already in terms of some partnerships and agreements. but can you i guess maybe just help us think about going forward where your any specific target growth areas would be within that business?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. listen that is a business that to a certain degree started from a customer pool. we discovered one day that a lot of the products that we were selling in carb solutions were finding their way into non-food applications, non-beverage application. so now we have started with a new team on a more proactive approach to that. so we have a market based approach where we're targeting things like construction and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and other products. and we've been very successful. this team has been growing -- they have been growing sales about 10 -- at the 10% click. these are very profitable opportunities and opportunities that at this point in time require no capital, because these are existing products going into new applications.
so we have hired experts, marketing experts, and technical experts to be able to sell these into new applications. and we fill in an incredible customer pool. every ceo or company out there that is announcing this de-carbonization goal's for 2040 or whatever needs to shift to plant-based materials from oil based in order to de-carbonize. and we are the largest company in that space with the ability to provide the broadest footprint of products.
so you will continue to see growth there, and we are just getting started. that will be my comment. we cannot talk a lot about -- as you can understand about our customer engagement, because these are confidential agreements that we have and a lot of these the customers don't want to disclose what they are doing.
steve haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thank you.

your next question is from ben kallo of baird.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
hi. thank you very much for taking my question. the first one is just on south america gross margin. could you just talk about, if there's a structural change or is it just a temporary change as it relates to biodiesel headwinds? and then the second question is on m&a. i know you just did a deal so congratulations on that. but on larger acquisition front from your experience one as -- are there targets out there? and then two, is it easier for the heavy lifting of integration to do a large acquisition than the smaller tuck-in ones like you announced yesterday? thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ben. so let me address south america first. so, of course, our bigger participation is brazil. it has been a tough year for brazil this first half of the year in general. we expect second half of the year to have the possibility to be a little better. biodiesel is b12 now and that has been confirmed. we'll have to see the first auctions there. so crush margins are better. domestic margins are $25 to $30 per ton export is about $10. bottle oil and volumes and prices are better in the last two months. we started the year tough there.
remember that, this is a society that is going through the tougher parts of covid. so demand is difficult there. but we have seen an improvement. domestic meal the market is also paying for the higher soybeans. so that's good. we have -- brazil has reduced exports of corn of course, because of the drought. but the domestic market is paying the premium. so brazil is not going to run out of corn, and it's importing a little bit from brazil. so i would say in general with oil -- domestic oil being supported and the volumes being there and with biodiesel going back to b12, we expect the second half of the year to be a little bit better than maybe what the first half was.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
and then the second question on m&a, just on targets and appetite for a larger deal and then the integration of smaller deals versus many smaller deals versus the large ones?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. you know that, we've been relatively quiet. we continue to be very selective about this because valuations are in general for some properties are a little bit too high. so it -- this needs to be a perfect fit into our portfolio. and the perfect combination of things with sojaprotein is in terms of the footprint, the complementarily of the geographic nature of it and the quality of management, and the assets and the products.
in terms of what is easier to integrate, i think that sometimes bolt-ons are a little bit easier. we find they fit better in a business that is already structured. when you bring a large company you need more adjustments on both sides if you will, if you think about some of these companies that have continued to operate in adm almost like with the same agility they were operating before, whether you say protexin or biopolis and some of these companies. so i think that the smaller companies are probably an easy tuck-in than maybe large companies. large companies take us a little bit longer.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst

your next question is from ben bienvenu of stephens.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning everyone. i appreciate you squeezing me in.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
hi, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
one quick one from me. you talked about the operational flexibility to shift and flex between softseed crushing and oilseed crushing. when you think about the backdrop for oilseed crushing margins across all your geographies, but in north america in particular where things are quite strong, those strong driven by soybean oil this go around, do you think the market is able to digest appropriately switching from a higher oil yield to a higher meal yield given the kind of relative softness in the meal market? and just how do you think about toggling between those two crush capacities in a market like this?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
listen at this point in time, we are seeing good demand for both products. so, of course, as you know, there is a big pull from oil. there has been a big pull for oil. and then rgd is increasing a little bit of that, but our ability to place the mill given our footprint and our commercial operations is very strong. so that gives us a lot of confidence for north america for the second half.
listen let me be clear. the oilseeds and ag services business will have a very strong year much better than last year and we expect a strong second half as well that will drive the company to earnings that we never had before certainly. and certainly, we'll be probably on the higher side or maybe outside the range of 4 to 4.50 that i mentioned before that was the previous landing spot of our strategy. that's what we're seeing at the moment. so the year started strong and we think that the second half will be very strong.
okay. very good. thank you juan and best of luck in the back half.

your final question is from eric larson of seaport research partners.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. good morning everyone. i hope everybody is doing well.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, eric.
ray young -- chief financial officer
thank you, eric.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
so, on the -- i know we're short on time, i'll make this question pretty quick and pretty direct. it's really going back i think a little to maybe adam's first question, maybe drilling down on some demand functions here in the near term. obviously, you've addressed the global biodiesel markets, what's going on there the us ethanol all the job owning of rfs and all that stuff. but people are talking about some chinks in the armor in some of the chinese demand at least in the near term. they've walked away from a little bit of corn imports in july, which has bought a thimbleful, and i think it spooked the market.
but i think the real issue here is asf in china -- have they had a major setback in that? and we just don't know what to kind of believe what's coming out of there. and now you've had the floods in china that's impacted about 10% of their growing area has killed a lot of hogs. is that -- is some of the near-term demand function a piece of the chinese afs problems that they're having?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think that, of course, as you described, there are many issues going on and there is a little bit of a transition here. but the reality is that pork prices have come down, that will incentivate demand. but you also need to understand that, in the -- during the asf, people get to eat more poultry as well. and we have seen that demand growth. we think that when we have a better supply and cheaper supply of soybeans, things will come back a little bit more to normal. when we check with our customers over there, fundamentally, nothing has changed. and if you look at the -- as i said the middle class in china and you look at the indicators of that, which is the consumption of the big four protein, they are all higher than prepandemic levels. so the consumer is there, the animals are there to be fed.
and i think that the rest is just a matter of tactical approaches, whether we had the big run-up in hog prices in china, then the government intervened to try to control that. now they are lower. they said more wheat. i think that's going to shift to include more soybean in the portfolio -- in the inclusion. so, we think that at the end of the day, there may be many monthly gyrations, but over time, protein consumption continues to go up and they will import more soybeans to actually satisfy that demand. so, we feel very confident about the future of the demand in china.

thank you, vikram. i'm pleased to share with you results that continue to demonstrate our success in delivering strong and sustained earnings growth. this morning, we reported record second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 44% versus the second quarter of 2020.
our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was about $4.5 billion, almost $900 million more than a year ago. and i'm proud to report that our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 9.7%, which is both significantly higher than the 8.1% of the prior year period and also represents the achievement of our 10% objective. i'm proud of the entire adm team for their great results this quarter. we're living up to our promises and our purpose. and the continuing execution of our strategy is delivering impressive ongoing growth for our company, our customers and our shareholders. i'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. slide 4, please.
over the last decade, we made cultural, technology and process changes that help us revolutionize how we do our work every day. we started with operational excellence, added to that performance excellence and expanded into readiness, which encompassed a broader array of specific actions within our control to drive value creation, including profitable growth.
now, as we enter the next phase of our strategic transformation, the concept of readiness will continue to be embedded in everything we do, but we will categorize our efforts going forward as either productivity or innovation. productivity is about using new technologies and thinking to automate, digitize and standardize our processes. it's a lever under our control that allows us to enhance efficiencies and manage costs. one great example of our productivity work is the digitalization of our procurement center of excellence. we're implementing best-in-breed technology that's standardizing processes and reducing costs in our indirect procurement. most importantly, this advancement is unleashing our colleagues to drive even greater value by transforming their work from tactical to strategic. that's just one example of the kind of initiatives, we're pursuing under productivity. across the enterprise, our productivity efforts collectively are expected to deliver about $200 million in savings in calendar year 2021.
please turn to slide 5. the other pillar of our strategy is innovation. innovation is how we are delivering profitable growth. and one of the key ways we will support and propel our innovation work is through an initiative we launched this year called ifd. ifd is a fundamental realignment of our human nutrition business commercial organization and go-to-market approach, from a product-driven focus to a more customer-centric, market segment-driven structure, focused on three global market segments, global foods, global beverages, global health and wellness. we are now able to move from consumer insight to concept to prototype to final solution more efficiently than before. already, ifd is enabling us to expand our sales pipelines and register record win rates. and this is only the start. ifd is a broad and ambitious effort, encompassing talent development, digital analytic and sales-enabling tools and streamlined product development processes, all designed to better match our vast pantry and technical development capabilities to our customers' needs and accelerate our speed to market.
slide 6, please. all of our strategic work is being supported and strengthened by our unique opportunity to use adm's integrated value chain to advance the decarbonization of our industry. for example, late last year, our decatur-based carbon capture and storage partnership, the world's first large-scale project to store carbon from a biofuel source, surpassed three million metric tons of carbon dioxide safely and permanently stored more than a mile under the earth's surface. that's the equivalent of removing about 650,000 cars from the road for a full year. and our efforts are continuing. we expect to sequester an additional 2.5 million tons -- million metric tons every -- over the next five years and we have the ability to do even more. this project is a game changer, a valuable and unique asset in our efforts to decarbonize our production footprint and reduce the carbon intensity of our products, as demonstrated by our intention to work with eight rivers to help build an innovative zero-emission power plant that will utilize this carbon capture capability.
next slide, please. our reorganization efforts span the entire ag value chain, including transportation. plant-based liquid fuels will continue to play a growing role in transportation, both on the ground and in the air and we are investing to ensure we can meet that expanding demand. in the second quarter, we were proud to announce the construction of north dakota's first-ever dedicated soybean processing complex. we expect our new spiritwood facility 600 million pounds of annual oil production, to help support fast expanding production of renewable green diesel. we've already broken ground on the north dakota complex and we plan for it to be operational in 2023, in time to meet growing demand. we expect the demand for us green diesel to continue securing higher rate of growth, increasing by about one billion gallons per year, and reaching up to five billion gallons by 2025. vegetable oils will be a key feedstock to meet that growing demand. and when you consider that it takes about 7.5 pounds of soybean oil to produce one gallon of renewable green diesel, you can appreciate the large potential opportunity and why we are investing to grow our participation both in north dakota and with our expanded oil refining capacity in quincy, illinois.
slide 8, please. another area in which our on-farm storage capabilities are helping us meet demand for more sustainable products is plant-based proteins. we made substantial investments in this space from our campo grande soy protein complex to our pea protein facility in north dakota to our plantplus foods joint venture. and as the opportunity for plant-based proteins accelerates by 12% a year, we are investing further to expand our participation. yesterday, we announced an agreement to purchase sojaprotein, southern europe's largest producer of soy-based protein products. sojaprotein is a perfect fit for our growth strategy. it represents a strategic addition to our global protein production capacity. it is a successful growing company with 2020 sales of more than $100 million and an extensive list of customers in 65 countries in the meat alternative, confectionery, protein bar, pharmaceutical, pet food, and animal feed segments. and it's locally sourced. exclusively non-gmo products are closely aligned with european consumer preferences.
when i look back on these accomplishments, i see our ongoing strategic transformation is delivering at an accelerated pace. our productivity and innovation focuses are powering performance and growth in large and fast-growing market opportunities, particularly those being propelled by strong consumer sentiment around sustainability. that's painting a bright future for adm, which i will talk more about at the end of this call. but first, i'll turn it over to ray to talk about our business performance.
ray?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks juan and good morning everyone. move to slide nine please. the ag services and oilseeds team followed up on their exceptional first quarter with another outstanding quarter. ag services results were higher year-over-year. the north american origination business delivered an outstanding second quarter, managing its positions effectively in a dynamic pricing environment and also achieved significantly higher export volumes, driven by corn sales to china. south american origination was significantly lower than the previous year's quarter driven by slower farmer selling and high commodity prices, which impacted contract fulfillment.
global trade performance was lower than the second -- strong second quarter of 2020 when customers were building inventories in mid-covid-19. results were also impacted by timing impacts that should reverse. crushing had substantially higher year-over-year results. the business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in north america soy and eu softseeds. results were partially offset by weaker soybean crush margins in south america, driven by lower demand for biodiesel. in addition there were about $70 million in net incremental negative timing effects which should reverse in the coming quarters. refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, driven by continued recovery in foodservice as well as positive timing effects in north america, partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the brazilian biodiesel mandates. equity earnings from wilmar were higher year-over-year.
now, looking ahead, we expect q3 performance for ag services and oilseeds to be higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven by stronger results in crushing. we continue to anticipate full year results that will be significantly higher than 2020's very strong performance.
slide 10, please. the carbohydrate solutions team did a great job delivering results that were almost double those of the prior year period. starches and sweeteners, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results in a highly dynamic pricing environment, driven by about $90 million in positioning gains across the ethanol complex, as well as more normalized results from corn oil. sweetener volumes were higher reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel. ethanol margins improved versus the prior year period driven by a resurgence in driving miles in the united states. vantage corn processor results were much higher than the second quarter of 2020 supported by the resumption of production of our two dry mills, improved fuel ethanol margins and favorable performance in usp-grade industrial alcohol from our peoria complex. now looking ahead, we expect tightening corn markets and their effects on ethanol margins to result in a third quarter for carbohydrates solutions that is lower compared to the third quarter of 2020, which included strong risk management gains. however, we expect full year carbohydrate solutions results to be substantially higher than 2020.
slide 11, please. nutrition delivered record sales and profits with 15% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis and operating profit of more than $200 million. in human nutrition, revenue was 13% higher than the second quarter of last year on a constant currency basis and operating profits were up 24%. in north america and emea, the flavors business delivered strong volumes and improved product mix, particularly in the beverage segment. specialty ingredients delivered strong sales growth in specialty proteins, though results were lower due to certain onetime costs, mainly in texturants. in health & wellness, stronger sales and margins in probiotics were offset by higher cost in fibers due to planned facility downtime.
animal nutrition revenue growth was 17% higher year-over-year on a constant currency basis and profits were up 44% as improved demand and margins in amino acids, strength in feed additives and ingredients and better performance in emea more than offset covid-19 and labor-related impacts in other regions. now looking ahead, we expect nutrition once again to deliver higher year-over-year results in the third quarter. and with continued strong demand, product innovation and great go-to-market execution by the team, we are raising our expectations for full year profit growth to 20%.
slide 12, please. so, let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. other business results were substantially lower than the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. as expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $248 million were driven primarily by higher performance-related compensation accruals, higher it offering and project-related costs and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. in other corporate, results included a valuation gain in our adm ventures portfolio. looking at total corporate costs including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020.
the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 14%. we still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in a range of 14% to 16%. our balance sheet remains solid despite a higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 29% and available liquidity of almost $9.5 billion.
with that, i'll turn it back to juan.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 13 please. when i look back on our outstanding first half results following a record 2020, i see a team that is executing at a high level and a strategy that is delivering according to our plan. we have been constantly refreshing our portfolio, divesting from non-strategic businesses and redeploying capital consistent with our strategy. in doing so, we've built industry-leading capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs in high-growth categories such as meat alternatives, a category we expect to reach more than $100 billion in sales worldwide by 2030 and in which our plantplus foods joint venture, now is participating, selling consumer products across brazil and ready in its north american launch. another example is dietary supplements, a segment on track to have $80 billion in sales globally by 2025; and in which we're constantly expanding our product portfolio including our recently introduced bio-kult brighten, which includes ingredients to reduce tiredness and fatigue.
and then there is pet food, which is forecast to grow to more than $130 billion globally by 2025 and an area in which we launched our new premium cat food in mexico, earlier this year. the list goes on. renewable green diesel, pharmaceuticals and personal care, beverages all large high-growth opportunities powered by macro consumer trends like sustainability and health and wellbeing. and in each of those segments and more, our unparalleled global footprint, fully integrated value chain, customer insight, broad portfolio and speed to market are setting us ahead of the competition and fueling our growth. that's why, we are so optimistic about our path forward. of course, there are always going to be short-term factors for us to navigate. but those are not things that will impact our long-term success.
our confidence is rooted in the transformation we began a decade ago and which continues with our work in productivity and innovation, as well as our expanding participation in large and fast-growing market opportunities. so to conclude, we have a great start of the year and we expect to continue our momentum, in the second half to deliver very strong 2021 earnings. as we've discussed, we are moving to a new phase of our strategic growth plan. with what we have accomplished over the years on capital discipline targeted cost reductions and cash generation and moving through our portfolio transformation and our efforts to optimize business performance, drive efficiencies and expand strategically. i believe we have successfully increased our base earnings power from $3 a share back in 2015 to a range of $4 to $4.50 this year.
and now, as we enter the next stage of our growth leveraging the key macro trends of food security health and well-being and sustainability with our continued focus on productivity and innovation and with future targeted investments, we believe our medium-term,annual earnings trend growth rate will be in the high single-digit percentages from these $4 to $4.50 per share baseline.
with that, operator please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from ben bienvenu from stephens. ben, your line is open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone.
ray young -- chief financial officer
good morning, ben.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
hey, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
so i've got one long-term question with regards to your announcement yesterday around saf. and then i want to ask a clarifier on the guidance. well, so on the announcement yesterday, congratulations. a couple of questions. one is when you think about the total opportunity for saf, obviously the embedded demand is significant given saf seems like one of the most pertinent ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the jet fuel market, the economics and producers that were unclear at this time. so i'm curious did you think about engaging with gevo on this partnership? one, what got you comfortable to commit these facilities to this end market ultimately and then help us think about kind of the evolution of how the agreement will mature because it is a memorandum of understanding? why did you go with that initially versus a more legally binding agreement? and then if you could just talk just to a bigger picture how you feel about the ultimate demand and implication for the ethanol markets, that would be helpful. i know a lot in there, but i'd love to hear you talk. got it?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, ben. yeah, listen, you know we've been looking at options for the dry mills for sort of a very, very long time. so we've been studying there opportunities for the adm shareholders too as we try to divest these assets. certainly, when we look at the sustainability trends and the opportunities, remember, one of the issues we do are, they are very large, would become -- which became a little bit of an issue of the time of divesting them. so we were looking for opportunities that are sizable, we are that size turns into a competitive advantage. so certainly, when you look at all industries trying to be carbonize, the evolution in the industry is a marked industry that contributes to co2 and we have identified, and we have checked with partners, strategic partners, people in the industry that they say yes is this solution.
and i think we see also concurrently that both the u.s. and the european governments are looking at this a year from now, try you heard, but it's in the buy, then or so good granholm making statements about that. so we see a very, very positive environment developing for these a very sizable addressable market for us. and when you combined, i want to size with our raw material procurements on our costs and the ability to decarbonize based on our carbon capture and sequestration, but a few recall, we've been running since 2017, allow that complex to provide very competitive low ci fuels for the industry. there's going to be a lot of discussion from ci that, so we decided to announce these, so there are many opportunities and potentially it could happen, which is the creation of these two joint ventures. one of those joint ventures, adm's contribution will be the two dry mills as our objective is, as you know, to deconsolidate these two. so again, but still many discussions to happen and many, many partners to join us into this, we are thinking over time to have a minority position in decent having probably strategic financial partners to join us. so, but overall, you can be assured this is a better outcome for our shareholders in terms of the realization of value from these two dry mills. so we're very excited about the opportunities.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay. great. my next question is a clarifier and then a discussion to be expected you can on kind of 2022, first, great that i hear you say on the ag services and oilseeds for the fourth quarter you expect it to be higher than the third quarter, but you didn't say higher than the fourth quarter last year. is that -- are those kind of the goalposts we should be thinking about? that's part one. and then question two within that is export demand look strong for next year, obviously renewable diesel is continuing to gain steam, how do you feel about ag services and crushing and that broader ag services and oilseeds segments as we go into 2022?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. so ben, listen, as we think about q4 for adm and when we say we expect a strong q4, we look at strong crush margins demand, this is strong for broad things, but also the demand for oilseeds is very strong and high and then your rgv on top of that. we are facing an improved ethanol environment as we entered the q4. we are estimating exports from the u.s. in volume similar to last year. so -- and if you think about the capacity situation last year, we didn't have reserve this year. unfortunately one of our competitors' plant is down because of why that's so kind of about the same situation. and then we continue to see nutrition growing at 15% to 20%. so of course, we have inflation, we have energy issues the team is dealing with it and trying to mitigate, but we are coming into q4 and into q1 with a strong momentum.
if you look at q1, we feel very strong about crush margins. our export window given that in september with these and export that march is probably going to be extended into january and february a little bit like maybe even longer than last year. so we feel very good at the moment, but again with an environment that there are supply chain issues that our energy inflation rising. so we will have to manage all that, but from a demand perspective, we feel very good about it.

our next comes from luke washer from bank of america. luke, your line is now open.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. good morning, team.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning.
ray young -- chief financial officer
good morning, luke.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
so i just wanted to ask a quick question, follow-up on ben's. you mentioned that at the peoria facility and this new mou gevo, you've done a lot with your ethanol assets. so just a clarifying point, is your strategic review of the ethanol assets completed? are you still thinking about now how you're looking at your fuel ethanol capacity even in the wet mills? or how is your thinking that evolved?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. no, i would say that the conclusion of protection we review ended in the best option for peoria lift the divested which was basically shared about 135 million gallons of our ethanol capacity and then we are thinking about two-thirds of all our ethanol capacity in this the mou with gevo, exploring options to transfer that into sustainable aviation fluids. and again, in the process the consolidating because we're going to be contributing these two assets to the joint venture. so -- but of course we're going to have some exposure to ethanol on a long-term basis, because we're still on the webinars, but what you have to think about it is that in our analysis, the supply demand fundamentals change for ethanol. first of all, remember we always said we didn't like the undifferentiate in nature of dry mills, in wet mills, we have more options to protect margins and to protect returns, but second is by taking all this capacity out of the market, basically got 900 million gallons in about two years are going to move from vehicle ethanol to saf feedstock. then i think -- we think that supply demand fundamentals and the margin environment of ethanol will change. so we feel that, that concludes our strategic asset and of course, we need to now execute on this transaction would still have a lot to be discussed.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just staying on carbohydrate solutions quickly, ray, i believe you said that operating profit in 4q will be comparable to 4q of last year, ethanol margins to certainly gotten a lot better and it looks like you believe that they will continue to be pretty good in 4q. so when i think about the startches and sweetener side, it would seem that you're seeing quite a bit of maybe margin compression or at least lower operating profit, is this just a function of you have higher input costs? and then how are you thinking about what your selling some of your sweeteners and your starches that will offset some of that margin pressure potentially?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah, you're right. we're going to have some higher input costs which is energy costs, particularly over in europe. so that's a little bit the headwind. at the same time, you're right, in the ethanol margins that we're seeing right now in the market are extremely healthy, and that's just reflective of a very tight supply demand situation right now and industry inventories have fallen down to 20 million barrels right now. and when you take a look at driving miles and gasoline demand, we're basically back to pre-pandemic levels of demand again. and so, on the positive side, i would have to say the ethanol margins are pretty robust. on the issue of sweeteners and starches, what's interesting is, while a lot of people kind of focus on hfcs guide the business, the other parts of our business are doing extremely well. the non-hfcs business, for example, citric acid demand is extremely strong. startches demand extremely strong. so when we put it all together, that's the reason why we provide the guidance that there are some puts and takes. but we expect our fourth quarter for carbohydrate solutions to be similar to where we were last year.
luke washer -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. very good. thank you.

our next question comes from ken zaslow from bank of montreal. ken, please go ahead.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
good morning, guys.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
morning, ben.
ray young -- chief financial officer
morning, ben.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
the investments that you've made the several of in the 75% in the pet business, lg chem, the acas bio, so how much capital have you deployed to this? what is the return expected on the -- i'll leave -- i'll start there and then i'll ask a follow-up to that?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. i mean i think we haven't disclosed the amount of capital in terms of the lg chem, i mean that's still being discussed right now in terms of how the partnership will form on lactic acid and polylactic acid. the acas bio is not that significant. the big investment that you mentioned here is really the p4, the top-down investment, the parent company. and again, we decided to invest 75% into it, right. so therefore, i think we've kind of manage that capital there. so the total invested capital on these recent announcements actually is far less than $1 billion -- far less than $1 billion and this is consistent with the kind of the bolt-on type of investment numbers that we've talked about in the past, ken.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
and then on the -- so your bolt-on investment. but if i take that and then while you said that in 2022 for nutrition, you -- so second half 15 and then you kind of blood is up a little bit to 15% to 20%, which is always nice to hear. but if you're adding less than $1 billion, it sounds like more than a bread basket, is that number of loans to start to accelerate relative and not just it seems to 20% is a bad number. it just seems like you're starting to put more capital to work. would you start to see that number accelerate at what year and what type of returns that we expected or is it just not enough to make a difference? i'm just trying to kind of cement that my head?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, certainly, it can. we will see acceleration based on these investments. when we talked about our plan, our plan of 15%, that plan was not contemplating any significant acquisitions and we were thinking and getting to about a $1 billion op in a couple of years, so that trajectory continues and will be accelerated some of these deals. some of these deals you have to understand our just bolt-ons where we plug some capacity where we don't have like team soyaprotein things like that and some other ones become more platforms that actually give us the people to accelerate even more our growth side. so -- but we will continue in an investment phase on nutrition because the opportunities out there, our customers are reacting positively to our value proposition and we see our pipeline and our quarterly wins continue to grow. so as long as we can post numbers of revenue growth in the 15% range and op growth in the 20% range, we know it's a good deal for the shareholders. so we're very pleased with the direction.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
one of the big picture question. one you outlined in every you do it, the press release, a consumer trend better you believe there's going to be the future of where we're going. i just want, you laid out eight, when you think of your portfolio, what percentage of your portfolio using targets those eight today? and then when i think about in three to five years, what percentage of your portfolio will target those eight items? and then i'll leave it there and i appreciate your time.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, that's a very good question for which will provide more granularity on the december 10 investor day. but i would say in general terms and that's where do you see us working on the evolution of the carbohydrate solutions portfolio, probably the carbohydrate solutions portfolio because we have the big assets is there one more difficult to adjust for some of these. we think that ag services and oilseeds and nutrition are much more aligned to that, and now that we are evolving the portfolio of carb solutions, we feel that the significant percentage of adm's in couple of years will be aligned toward these trends, which makes us very, very optimistic about the future. we are very well positioned for all this long-term trends.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
but in the analyst day, your percentages or something to give some context like ahead by five years will be kind of percentage, some context is part of how you're thinking. so i just hope that you do that, we appreciate it. thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. we will provide that granularity. thank you.

our next question comes from michael piken from cleveland research, michael, your line is open.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yeah. i'm just understand a little bit better. your outlook you mentioned that the outlook for china and their grain demand is going to be strong. could you quantify what you think for their corn and soybean exports for the next year and then also could you share that with us?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, mike. we still believe that growth in demand is very strong and when we look and we check with our team in china, we still believe that china will need to import about a 100 [million tons we will take of soybeans and about 25 million tonnes of core. so of that form the majority will come from the u.s., a little bit from ukraine. so we think that the volumes, although maybe slightly in a different way than last year, right now consumers are a little bit more short-term more hand to mouth, if you will, because they were expecting from a little bit of a correction in prices, as we were hit in the heart of it. but we've seen chinese buyers come to the u.s. in the last few weeks and we feel very good about this export season. you have to remember that we were in a tight situation from a supply demand perspective given these important numbers and then when you add that some of that capacity has been taken out, this will make it for a tight export season that will probably have rolled forward maybe a month since in october -- of the beginning of october of all these facilities. we're still trying to recover power.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up is just, it seems like right now there are shortages of fertilizer and maybe glyphosate. what is your expectation for in brazil or even in the u.s., but do you think we're going to be able to have enough fertilizer to plant crops around the world? and what does that mean for your fertilizer business that more broadly speaking? are you worried about being able to get enough power plants that around the world or how -- what's the work around from that? thanks.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. at this point in time, it's a matter of price, of course, natural gas have driven these up different situation when you are in europe, when you are in north america, the north america is saying like five to six bucks, we're not sure, i got the europe has been saying maybe 30, but i would say at this point in time, it continues to be available for farmers only at higher price to some. we haven't detected the big shift in acreage from one to the other, it is still a little bit early from a planting intentions and you could think that potentially could be a shift from corn to soybeans, that it's not clear yet. and probably the numbers today are a little bit of tough hub for the farmer on what to go, so for acreage for next year.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.

our next question comes from tom simonitsch from jp morgan. tom, your line is open.
tom simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
morning, tom.
ray young -- chief financial officer
hey, tom.
tom simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
so you just opened a flavor production facility in china to serve as a supply hub in the region, what is your outlook for nutrition in asia-pacific compared to other regions? you've called out apac is an area of weakness in both human and animal nutrition in the last couple of quarters. so how much of that relative weakness is down to adm's current capabilities in the region as opposed to product?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. you are right on that. i think that we've been very proud of being nutrition, this mainly has been happening on the developed parts of the world, if you're willing which developing markets exposure is still all for adm, whether we're talking about south america or to asia-pacific. so in asia pacific, we've been a player in flavors for a while and this is -- this is just an expansion, this is that about and now we're a way from a consumption solution, very good; from a raw material perspective, we still very good; from an access to a big consumption, very good and this will be very important for our customers. our participation in asia was limited to one plan for flavors and about a handful of plans for animal nutrition, and we continue to build that position in animal nutrition. we feel very good about this and then this opportunity in flavors, we will enhance our capabilities, not just production, but also market development and probably to the customer innovation centers. so you will see us going and putting more flags on the world in the developing areas whether it is asia-pacific or south america, as we need to go and support our global customers. these are our customers that we do business every day here and some of them are represented there, but also we have a lot of new local customers that are required in this capability. so it's just a natural evolution of the business if you will.
tom simonitsch -- jp morgan -- analyst
thanks for that one. and just following up on saf, what is your operating plan for the two dry mills between now and 2025,when the saf production is expected to come online?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, we expect the construction around that area. there'll probably be some transition. but as we kind of look out over the next couple of years, we do expect that driving miles are going to be coming back. we're seeing tight s&d right now in terms of our industry. we're seeing frankly the rest of world is starting to recover from the pandemic. so we expect rest of the world driving miles to start recovering. and so, therefore, there is a lag in terms of recovery of exports of ethanol from united states to the rest of the world. so i think over the next couple of years, i think you're going to continue to see some level of demand recovery from outside of united states for ethanol. and then even china, as we've talked about, i mean their focus on the environment on energy, you could actually see china and you're returning back to the markets and we've seen -- we're seeing a little bit of that already.
ray young -- chief financial officer
so let me clarify from that operations perspective. we're not going to be doing anything to these dry mills. the dry mills will produce ethanol and then there is downstream technology and capabilities that gevo brings to the table to transform them into saf, but those two plants will continue to produce ethanol as they are, we are not planning to invest capital into that. our contribution is those two plans and then gevo takes it from there from a downstream perspective.

our next question comes from ben theurer from barclays. ben, please proceed.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. good morning, juan and ray. congrats on the results. just two quick follow-up questions, one on ag service and i understand your commentary around the expectation into the fourth quarter, but just trying to maybe get a little bit of a sense differently. so, clearly you had some implications in the third quarter because of hurricane ida and you expect some of those effects to reverse in coming quarters. are you comfortable enough that those almost immediately reversing and benefiting your fourth quarter? so to speak, have a chance to get some more close to where it was last year? so that would be my first question.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. i would say, we expect the strong quarter for ag services in this year and you have to understand, sometimes at the end of the year, it becomes complicated because there could be margin expansion in march and june construction here and the accounting rules [technical issues] read into q1 and we need to respect that. what we're talking what we can determine from middle of october, which is today is the fundamentals on the market and demand is a strong and the export capacity was tight starting into these and we started to see our -- so we feel good about it. so i think [technical issues] and it's difficult to call it sometimes in q4 versus q1 because we are accounting groups and we can determine that now. we have to determine that at the end of the year.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. and then if we take a look at the at the nutrition business and you've highlighted it in your prepared remarks, obviously the very strong performance on the animal nutrition side almost doubling operating profit that in human nutrition on the other side, growth was just in the high single digits. could you explore a little more on the details of what were the issues for the maybe little lower than what you would want to see growth in human nutrition? was it more of an impact because of input cost pressure or you just didn't pass it on significantly in the way you would have wanted to? or are there certain demand issues still in certain areas, just to understand a little better what's been driving the growth in human nutrition offsetting some of the growth, put it that way better?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. well, if you look at the human nutrition for the water, we grew about revenue about plus percent. i mean, it's actually a pretty good number and i think if you look at where ebitda margin on the sales, we were able to maintain that ebitda margin also, so when you grow twice the industry clip, if you will and you maintain margins, so i was pretty satisfied, of course, it is not the spectacular maybe improvement year-over-year that animal nutrition had, but it's because human nutrition has been more stable and doing that you saw and in animal, we're still going through the neovia integration and all those things, but no, i don't think it was a weak quarter at all actually. i think, as i said, we continue to grow or maybe twice the industry rate and maintaining very robust ebitda margins on sales. so ebitda margin on sales for flavors are north of 20% and we've been able to maintain despite...
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
congrats again. thank you very much.

our next question is from robert moskow from credit suisse. robert, please proceed.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, just a couple of cleanup questions. can you talk about your pricing outlook for corn sweeteners? it would appear that corn prices have been on kind of a roller coaster that they're down off their highs, how is that impacting negotiations for next year? and then i had a follow-up on the pea protein market.
ray young -- chief financial officer
hey, robert, it's ray here. so the contracting season is underway and we expect hfc as volumes and margins to remain strong in 2022. clearly there has been some volatility in terms of corn prices and that's frankly the input cost will get reflected in terms of our contract pricing and we do expect contract pricing to be higher next year compared to this year. volume wise, we do expect volumes for claim to be similar to what we've seen this year. we are seeing recovery in terms of the foodservice sector i think what -- when i look at carbohydrate solutions in total non-hfcs is actually a very important component as well, and we've seen non-hfc pretty attractive with a good margin [technical issues] side and that is reflective of really a strong demand environment, for citric acids, for starches, for dex drills and other products. so that's another important factor when you take a look [technical issues]
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then if you look at carbohydrate solutions business in top level for 2022, as i indicated earlier, would you think that the biofuel part of the business should be actually quite positive when you compare [technical issues]
ray young -- chief financial officer
[technical issues] year compared to this year. so when you put it all together, we do expect carb solutions have another strong [technical issues].
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then the follow-up on key proteins, you mentioned -- i think alternative protein briefly, i thought i heard that the pea crop in canada was kind of weak, but my perception is that doesn't matter that much to processors like yourself, but maybe you can help me understand whether it does or it doesn't and how much volume are you doing in that market for the alternative meat end markets?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
facility and we feel pretty good about that business actually. in systems and pea protein that we see in some of these new verticals and both business is a relatively new. they have almost no revenue in 2020 for us and they are providing alternative solutions. so at this point in time, soy is the main driver for us. op is our supplementary perspective is not a big impact, so we haven't felt any impacting our plant at all.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it, ok. thank you.

our next question comes from vincent andrews from morgan stanley, vincent, your line is open.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you and good morning, everyone. juan, i just wanted to ask you on the lg chem -- excise me, the lg chem jv, why we set up in two jvs rather than just sort of one-integrated production of lactic acid and then into tha, what's the thought process behind having sort of an upstream and a downstream setup?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. this is a matter of where the expertise of each company lies. and then, to be honest also, we want to be asset light as possible. so in areas where lg is dominant and they're going to build that downstream capacity, when we think about biosolutions, i would object vince is to make may be different ownership position, but we start making chemicals or application technology and all that, we cannot become a chemical company. so, in that we let the partner think of sort dominant position. so we make corn grain plus one, if you will, and then we let our partners take it from there. it's just a matter of optimized capital for us and not invest in areas where we are not -- that are not core for us -- core areas for us. we will continue to be food and feed and beverages. when we go into these materials, if we're going to produce grain liquid, that makes sense. and then we have the partner doing the best.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
once we get the full details of the agreement, we'll see where the economics are set up and that will make sense that your investments will be in your sort of center the plate focus and there some that. as a follow-up on the fertilizer issue, obviously available concerns, but it seems like what is happening is that the high prices are different fertilizer purchases, particularly in south america and up or so, the big soy groups are timing farmers to buy less fertilizer, et cetera and do your slide showing that farmer sales or i guess it, the five-year average, which is probably ok, but they're well below last year and five-year before. so what impact of that have on your origination business if the farmers slow to sell to be playing out for you moving into next year.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, i would say, south america, it's always an issue with a little bit more factors in terms of farmer selling just because of the currency and under the distortion of that, sometimes the government bring into the market. so at this point in time, we continue to see -- we continue to see maybe relatively slow farmer selling in argentina and that will probably continue. it's been a little bit better in brazil recently, but it's still a relatively slow versus the accelerated pace at which they sold last year.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. our next question comes from vincent anderson from [technical issues]
vincent anderson -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
[technical issues] from a little bit of a different direction knowing that the agreement to be finalized, but philosophically, it sounds like you're maybe trying to prioritise giving incremental return out of your core competency and fermentation technology. but maybe limiting direct participation in the pla market and i ask just because that is a bit more of a commodity business, then it feels like you've pushed more of your investments to a bit more.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, i think that as we said, we're trying to do -- i think as you said, we're trying to optimize our facilities and touch those facilities to demand that has more growth opportunity. in this issue, again, we don't want to go into making chemicals, that's a heavy capital intense and intensive industry and we want to make one derivative and then we serve all that capital to continue to grow in food, feed and beverages and health and wellness, that's what we're trying to do. so lg chem is a great partner. we're very honored to have been, they have very good technology and it's a little bit like the gevo discussion. we're going to continue to make ethanol, they will take it from there to make it, they say yes and with this partnership, we're going to make lactic, they're going to take it from there to make pls, it's kind of the similar market.
vincent anderson -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
that's perfect. thank you. and then just a quick point of clarification, if i understand the phrasing of the mou announcement, it sounded like you're considering investing in lactic acid capacity that would maybe exceed lg needs and then you would market the remaining product yourself. is that correct? and could you just talk briefly about the opportunity there as a stand-alone investment?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah. listen, part of that is correct. i mean lactic has -- you can go to many opportunities, but this is relatively only the teams are looking at these that there is a lot -- there are a lot of numbers, there are a lot of things that could still change, there are a lot of discussion. so i wouldn't like to venture that march since the teams are still discussing with lg chem by 2050, 2060, 2040, whatever that is, and they are looking back to their portfolio. they need to clean their portfolios, if you will, and one of their ways to do that is through a recycling, the other way to do it is still go in plant-based. so we are receiving a lot of inbound request on that and we're looking at outward offsets our ability to produce plant-based products and our carbon capture sequestration that provides an opportunity to make lower ci products and we are trying to maximize the opportunity for adm on all these. so some of these things may not be that well defined because we are in the process of optimizing on that volume for the adm shareholders. it's a great opportunity for us and we will be mindful of returns and we know into areas that we shouldn't be putting capital. the capital will be reserved for our main thrust of the strategy, which is to continue to grow in food and feed and beverage.
vincent anderson -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
understood. i appreciate the added detail. i look forward to hearing more about it.
ray young -- chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from eric larson from seaport research partners. eric, your line is open.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. so gevo and kind of the whole transaction and i know that one of your maybe not to put a bad word, what are your dislike [technical issues] facility of the earnings and in some of the factors your lack of ability to control some of those factors and when we talked about the dry mills in the past, one of the things was trying to reduce your earnings volatility. so in the economics of how you negotiate -- we don't know more aif, but have you been able to -- do you think you have been able to interim agreement that actually gives you more sustainability or i guess volatility of earnings on the economics of, let's say, up going forward relative to ethanol?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. you're correct that returns are important to us, but also dampen the volatility is in the mind of everything we do. so, of course, the team is considering that i can't disclose that much at this early on, but i think what you need to also think is that over time we will try to become a minority partner and some of the objective goals, this is to deconsolidate and take all those assets out of our participation. so, to a certain degree, we are acting [technical issues] nurse long term of this. that's why i talked before about strategic partners of financial power. i think we're going to be able to deconsolidate. we are going to be able to monetize some [technical issues]. if there is some upside to that, hopefully participate in all that. but you're correct, the objective [technical issues] participating things that aren't to volatility, but actually the dumpen volatility and we've been very consistent in that over the last 10 years.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay, a lot. so when you look at the size of your dry mill investments, those are relatively new assets. but i guess they're probably eight to 10 years already, so you probably depreciated them pretty significantly already [technical issues] that the jv putting those assets in there or would you expect to see you maybe a modest capital return as part of that jv agreement as well?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
that we landed in this is that the valuation of our assets. i mean it's better than the alternative that we have. so,we are pleased with the value of which we are contributing these two assets. we don't need or we don't plan to have any capex to all these two plants. these two plants will be contributed as such, and they will operate as i'd say that starts then the joint venture or gevo may put money for finishing of these and to convert it into a -- through their technology. but our participation stops in the contribution of these two dry mills [indecipherable].
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you. one, i mean i know the right of time, so i'll i'll leave my questions at that time. thanks everybody.

our next question is from adam samuelson from goldman sachs. adam, your line is open.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. so what a lot of ground been covered, so trying to make this quick. on the [technical issues] you just maybe clarify just sort of the gating factors of what you'd be looking for on the regulatory side to really move ahead here obviously saf doesn't participate today in the rfs harvest for california programs. so what would you want to see in terms of federal or state action on a saf before you really fully committed going ahead?
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. listen, we have experience in both the u.s. and the european union, a strong desire to make this a reality. there is not another efficient way to cannibalize the airlines industry, the aviation industry. of course, only short haul you can put the battery in a plane, long haul is something like this. so we expect the government to be a partner to a certain degree in creating some of these markets. some of those things that we are too early for me to disclose, but there are commitments both the u.s. government and the european union to create the market for that in the 60 billion gallons type of size. so they're going to be some help into that, but that's probably to the extent that i can talk about a good way.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay and then just quickly on the balance sheet, maybe this is for ray. at the end of the quarter, net debt to ebitda was up two times. you haven't bought back any stock this year. just help us think about -- how we think about stock buyback as part of the capital allocation that's going forward?
ray young -- chief financial officer
i think that we've been monitoring commodity prices very careful and when you look at our operating working capital right now, it's still $2 billion higher than we were last year. so as we think about commodity prices next year, assuming you have a strong south american crop. you have a normal crop in united states. we see commodity prices coming off again. after we've kind of funded some of the bolt-on acquisitions that we've talked about, i expect our balance sheet to be pretty strong. and so there we can probably start looking back at return of capital that we've looked like in the past. so i think a lot of it is a function of funding the investments that we talked about. but importantly, making sure that the working capital environment reverts back to normalized levels, which i think i sense, assuming a normal south american crop, a normal u.s. crop next year. i see opportunities to look at return of capital.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, all right, i'll leave it there. thanks so much.

hello and good morning and welcome to the adm's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce your host for today's call, vikram luthar, senior vice president, head of investor relations, chief financial officer of nutrition for adm. mr. luthar, you may begin. thank you, emily. good morning and welcome to adm's third quarter earnings webcast. starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com. for those following the presentation, please turn to slide 2, the company's safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. these statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. adm has provided additional information in its reports on file with the sec concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation, and you should carefully review the assumptions and factors in our sec reports.

please turn to slide 3. i will now turn the call over to juan.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, vikram. this morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, let me say 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate and our year-to-date adjusted eps of $3.69. this is already above our full-year 2020 adjusted eps. adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020 and our 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year op growth. our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was about $4.6 billion, almost a $1 billion more than a year ago. and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year-ago period.
i remain proud to lead a global team that is delivering robust returns and sustained growth in profit. our strong quarter and our ongoing upward trajectory, our system into our team's execution and agility and the consistent implementation of our strategic plan. i'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. slide 4 please. i'd like to start by talking about our approach to portfolio management. our starting point, if they believe that in order to thrive and create value, a company needs to have a dynamic view office business portfolio. so when we talked about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event. it is a representation of our continuous work to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. of course, those opportunities may be the -- must be the right ones. the enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability provide unique and stable opportunities for adm to expand our existing capabilities, and we are focusing our efforts on identifying high growth on trend areas with attractive margins and which are adjacent to our existing capabilities, that focusing from the building of our global nutrition business.
the acquisition of wild gave us entry into flavors and a global taste platform. we then use bolt-on acquisitions to other adjacent capabilities and build a one-stop shop with an industry-leading pantry of ingredients and solutions for human nutrition. we did the same for animal nutrition with the acquisition of neovia and we continue to do the same today across our business. in order to meet growing demand for sustainable solutions, we have announced a joint venture, an offtake agreement with marathon oil company to support the production of renewable diesel. we are continuing to invest in key nutrition categories as demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade. we are further enhancing our capabilities with the acquisition of sojaprotein. and with global demand for pet food grow into the $140 billion in the coming years.
we are continuing our growth with a 75% ownership stake in petdine. in the early of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with vland biotech to launch a joint venture that we perfectly positioned to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in china. these are just some examples of how we are dynamically positioned in our portfolio to continue driving growth for years to come. there will be more to come. and you can expect an increased level of investments to support our sustainable earnings growth and sort of that expand our capacity and capabilities.
please turn to slide 5. as part of our portfolio management approach, we're looking to evolve our carbohydrate solutions business, expanding our array of solutions to meet growing customer demand driven by the enduring trend of sustainability. we've made significant progress recently focused on two areas. new opportunities for our alcohol production, an ever growing volume solutions platform. let me start with alcohol. last thursday, we announced that we reached an agreement, which we expect to close at the end of the month to sell our ethanol facility in peoria. and yesterday, we announced a memorandum of understanding with gevo to explore potential joint venture, one of which would include our columbus and cedar rapids dry mills and our ethanol assets indicator transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low carbon sustainable aviation fuel. these actions represent our commitment to a process that we began when we first analysis to tissue review of our dry mills. taken together, they will allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol while using our expertise and assets to capitalize on new opportunities. saf is one of those opportunities. the u.s. and eu have set goals that together with support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050.
the other focus area for our carbohydrate solutions evolution were biosolutions growth platform. biosolutions, which we launched a year ago, it's an effort focused on using our product streams to expand our participation in sustainable higher margin solutions for attractive end markets like pharmaceuticals and personal care. this is an area of significant potential and our team is doing a great job identifying new and exciting opportunities. earlier this fall, for example, we signed an mou with lg chem for the production of lactic and polylactic acids for bioplastics, another plant-based products. these efforts and enable in biosolutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first nine months of this year and we believe there are many new opportunities to come.
so from the transformation of our dry mills to our growing biosolutions platform, our work to evolve our work carbohydrate solutions capabilities is a perfect example of how we're managing our portfolio and delivering the smart strategic growth and one of the many reasons we remain convinced and our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth in the years to come. i'll talk a little bit more about our business outlook at the end of our call. and of course, we'll be going into much more detail at our global investor day on december 10th.
but in the meantime, i will turn the call to over to ray to talk about our business performance. ray?
ray young -- chief financial officer
great. thanks, juan. slide 6, please. the ag services and royalties team continue their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. in ag services, we're proud to tell the team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift return to operation after hurricane ida. overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter, driven by approximately $50 million in that timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters, as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period, and lower export volumes caused by hurricane ida. global trade continues its strong performance. the crushing team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results, executed well, delivering stronger margins in a dynamic environment that includes strong demand for vegetable oils to support our existing food customers as well as the increasing production of renewable diesel. results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter.
refined products and other results were significantly higher than prior year period, driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million, our expected to reverse in future quarters. strong execution in emea and north american biodiesel and strong refining premiums due to demand for renewable diesel and foodservice recovery in north america also contributed to the results. equity earnings from wilmar were lower year-over-year. looking ahead, we expect to see continued fundamental demand strength for ag services and oilseeds products including from china, as well as solid global soybean crush margin environment in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs. in addition, rpo will be negatively impacted by timing reversals. all told, we expect results in the fourth quarter to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year.
slide 7 please. carbohydrate solutions results were lower year-over-year. the startches and sweetener sub segment including ethanol production from our wet mills showed their agility by managing through dynamic market conditions and optimizing mix between sweeteners and ethanol production through the quarter. year-over-year results were significantly lower, primarily due to higher input costs. vantage corn processors results were much higher versus the third quarter of 2020 supported by the resumption of production of at our two dry mills and improved fuel ethanol margins, particularly late in the quarter.
looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the solid fundamentals from the end of the third quarter to continue for carbohydrate solutions with good ethanol margins extending through the quarter due to industry supply demand balance and solid demand for corn oil and starches offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly in europe as well as the absence of the pure dry mill. also fourth quarter results for the segment should be similar to the previous year fourth quarter.
on slide 8, the nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory was 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year and continued strong ebitda margins. the human nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profit, higher volume improved pilot mix, particular strength in beverage drove strong flavor results in emea in north america, partially offset by lower results in apac. specialty ingredients continued to benefit from strong demand for alternative proteins, offset by some higher costs. health & wellness results were higher on robust sales growth in bioactives and fiber. aninal nutrition profits were nearly double the year-ago period and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the strength in the mineral assets as well as feed additives and ingredients, partially offset by higher costs in latam and slower demand recovery in apac. looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path with strength across the human and animal nutrition leading to strong year-over-year earnings expansion in the fourth quarter and a 20% full year growth versus 2020.
slide 9 please. let me finish up with few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. other business results were substantially lower than the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. we expect fourth quarter to have some additional insurance underwriting losses, resulting in a breakeven other business for the fourth quarter.
as expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher it offerings and project-related costs and transverse cost into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operation. looking at total corporate costs including net interest, corporate unallcoated and other corporate, we are still on track fourth calendar year to be overall similar to 2020. the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%. we anticipate our calendar year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% through 16% and potentially a bit higher depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter. our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion.
with that, i will turn it back to juan.
juan luciano -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 10 please. from consistent sustained profitable growth for the ongoing management of our business and product portfolio, our team has a lot to be positive. and there's one other thing we achieved last quarter that i want to mention. we have many team members impacted when hurricane ida hit in late august. so we provide temporary housing arrangements, portable generators, food and water and more. in fact, many adm colleagues travelled through the region and spend time helping repair their coworkers damaged homes. i'm very proud of that and very thankful to our team. i put the rest of my close remarks those insured as we plan to go into our outlook in far more of this when our december 10 global investor day.
as i look back at the third quarter and all of the last nine months, i continue to see a team and a company that are delivering on our goals and our purpose. we are closing out 2021 with great momentum. we are on track for a strong fourth quarter and the second consecutive year of record earnings per share. and as we look ahead to 2022, we see another strong year for adm. robust global demand environment will continue to go for opportunities for us to leverage our indispensable global origination, processing, and logistics capabilities. and nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory in line with our 15% per annum trend rate growth and on its way to $1 billion in operating profit in the coming years. of course, there are things we continue to watch including energy costs and inflation more widely and much abilities to meet needs in the enduring trend areas of food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability and a truly unparallel team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in a strong year to come.
with that, emily, please open the line for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question from the phone lines comes from ben theurer of barclays. please go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
thank you very much and good morning. juan, ray, congrats on those very strong results.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ben.
ray young -- chief financial officer
thank you, ben.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
so to start off, maybe just to stay a little bit within the outlook, i mean, clearly, you continue to have a very positive view on the segment side. but could you also share a little bit of your assumptions in terms of capex needs and where you think investment needs to be put into in order to deliver on the actual supply of these? so a little bit of your capex program and how you feel about that then, ultimately, the results flowing down to net income and what your expectations are for 2022.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so many questions wrapped in one, ben. good job. on a capex perspective here, as you look at our strategic plan, most of our strategic plan is coming from organic growth and productivity.
so in order to fund that, we can have a little bit higher capex this year of about $1.3 billion. that will be, of course, in some of the projects we need to do to expand like spiritwood that we announced our jv with marathon. but also, again, some productivity enhancements to make sure we deliver bigger volumes as we supply that demand. as you know, we are facing 2022 with a very strong perspective for the first quarter.
we are entering the year with great momentum as we left 2021 also in a big high. so at this point in time, we continue to see a very strong 2022. and i think i described it in all my commentary. ag services and oilseeds continue to be firing in all cylinders, and we expect the year as good as last year or maybe even better.
carb solutions also going very strong with many -- with a very stable starch and sweeteners and with always some uncertainty on ethanol but with a favorable environment. and biosolutions continue to grow as we grew last year. and again, nutrition going up above 15% per year, operating profit growth on double-digit revenue growth. so all in all, we feel very good about all the things that we can control.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. and then just one last question, just a quick one. if you think about your medium-term targets -- and i remember you've laid out obviously as well the initiatives for share buybacks, etc..
but in light of the higher capex plus the increase in dividend, fair to assume that share buybacks, at least in the short term, aren't going to be a priority yet, correct?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the priorities for capital allocation is to deleverage after we had maybe a couple of billion dollars invested in acquisitions, certainly fund the projects that we have in higher capex, as i described, and then the dividend -- to support the dividend. of course, cash flow generation is strong in adm. we focus a lot on that.
so as cash flow becomes available, i mean, we're going to think in the -- again, in the five-year plan, to have more buybacks in the later period. but if cash flow continues to be as strong, we might anticipate that a little bit. at this point in time, we don't expect significant m&a as part of our plan. so that will be the capital allocation decision.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. juan, very clear. thank you very much and congrats again.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, ben. we now have the next question from ben bienvenu of stephens. please go ahead. your line is open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey. thanks, good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter. i want to follow up on the outlook commentary, which was really helpful and detailed. of particular interest to us is the bioproducts commentary that you offered.
i think within the carbohydrate solutions business, the commentary around starches and sweeteners makes sense. the bioproducts obviously benefited from a very strong fourth quarter. and i suspect perhaps you had an opportunity to secure margins into the first quarter. but the commentary is pretty positive through the balance of the year, and i realize higher production will help in benefiting operating profit for that business.
can you talk a little bit about what informs your view for the strength of the ethanol business sustaining into 2022?
ray young -- chief financial officer
hey, ben. it's ray here. yeah. we finished up very strong in the bioproducts business, ethanol specifically.
the fourth quarter demand environment was very, very constructive. and i think that's just reflective of what was happening in terms of the recovery in driving miles in the united states. the holiday season gasoline demand was strong. that translates to strong demand for ethanol.
and on the supply side, i mean, actually, the industry had some supply challenges. and so that translated to a very robust environment. in fact, our ebitda margins in the fourth quarter for our ethanol business were above $1 a gallon, which is very, very -- on a historical basis, very, very strong. we indicate that as we go into 2022, we feel optimistic about ethanol as well.
now while inventories have built up a little bit in january, and that's just a seasonal nature of ethanol -- of inventory builds, a couple of things give us optimism for 2022. number one, we do expect domestic demand for ethanol to be strong. in fact, it will be a growth year over year from '21 to '22. and frankly, we're seeing ethanol demand probably returning back to pre-pandemic levels of demand here in the united states.
so we're talking about domestic demand probably in the 14-billion-gallon level. secondly, i think you're going to see a recovery around the world on gasoline demand and, hence, ethanol demand as well. and as you know, with the movement in crude oil prices in general, ethanol is becoming one of the most attractive oxygenates in the world. so we do see the export demand side of the equation in 2022 being also very constructive for ethanol, with ethanol probably recovering to 1.4 to 1.5 billion gallons in terms of export demand.
so that's very, very constructive. thirdly, we do believe that the regulatory landscape has clarified itself in the context of small refinery exemptions. i know there's some challenges going on here. but what we see right now is, going forward, smaller sres, as they call it, small refinery exemptions, will not have an impact in terms of kind of like the supply demand balances.
and we talk internally that when they say 15 billion gallons, it means 15 billion gallons, right, in terms of what we need to deliver to the marketplace. so that's actually a positive also for our industry. and then they've also remanded about 250 million gallons in terms of requirements as well going forward. so when you add it all together, the fact that we're starting off the year with a fairly balanced supply demand perspective in terms of u.s.
ethanol inventories; two, a demand environment that's going to be even more constructive versus 2021; and three, a regulatory environment that seems to be supportive of where we want to go, we're actually having a constructive viewpoint. as juan indicated, directionally, we're assuming $0.15 to $0.25 per gallon as ebitda margins for 2022. that's lower than the '21 assumption, and maybe, we're just being a little bit conservative about this juncture as we start off the year. but nevertheless, we do believe that it should be a favorable environment for us as we move forward into 2022.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. that's great. very helpful, ray. thank you.
and my second question is just related to the global operating environment and, in particular, some of the goings-on in ukraine at the moment and tensions there. is that -- how is that manifesting itself today in terms of the impact to your business? i know from an asset footprint perspective, you guys don't have super heavy exposure there, but they are a major producer of grapeseed, corn, wheat, barley. so i'm curious what impact you're seeing in the market today and how you think about the potential impact as we look into 2022, recognizing a lot of different scenarios could play out there.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, ben. of course, you realize the supply of many commodities remains at their tightest levels in years. so i think any news around the world of disruption, whether it's weather or geopolitics, i mean it's going to prolong the high prices well into probably 2023. as you described, at this point in time, there are three things.
we're all looking at the development of the crops in south america as they need to go through february rains, especially in argentina and the harvest in brazil. we are looking, of course, at geopolitical conflicts and like the one you described and also the expectations of the crop in the u.s., all these in the middle of a very strong demand. so as you said, ukraine is a big exporter, especially if you think about corn and the ability to supply china needs that you have the three main suppliers with the u.s. and you have ukraine and you have brazil.
so hopefully, brazil, with this range will have a safrinha crop that is maybe a little bit better than what we expected. but among these three countries need to cover the supply of corn. and corn today is one of the best sources of energy and fat, and they are one of the cheapest ones. so it's a very demanded product.
so we're all paying attention to what happened with that.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you, juan. congrats on the quarter and best of luck into 2022.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer

operator
thank you. we now have another question on the phone lines from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. sir, adam, please go ahead when you're ready.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you and good morning, everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i guess my first question, i want to come back to the outlook in carbohydrate solutions and just make sure i'm understanding the moving pieces to think about a full year 2022 outlook that's only slightly below 2021, where both your '22 -- '21 performance was above what you would have expected in 2025 for the unit. and just trying to think about the moving pieces with ethanol, and maybe there's a clarification point on the -- when you talk about ethanol margins, $0.15 to $0.25 a gallon ebitda, is that purely the dry mill gallons within vantage corn processors? is that including the wet mill? and i guess in that vein, in the fourth quarter, given the strong ethanol margin environment, i guess i was surprised just to have seen the starches and sweeteners business be down if that was -- should have also been benefiting from a strong u.s. ethanol environment. so maybe just help us think about some of the bridges of the pieces within the segment to get you to the '22 outlook.
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah, adam. it's ray here. so $0.15 to $0.25 ebitda margin represents total ethanol, wet mill, and dry mills. so that's a combined basis on that assumption.
in the fourth quarter, we had, as you saw, an outstanding quarter. vcp really benefited from the ethanol margins. and clearly, starches and sweeteners also benefit as well on the ethanol side of the business. our net corn cost was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for starches and sweeteners.
and if you recall, when we hedged 2021 for corn, we put on a very attractive hedge position in 2020 for a lot of our 2021 requirements, but not all the requirements. and so when we got to the fourth quarter, i think we were a little bit more exposed on that corn. and so, therefore, the higher net corn cost translates maybe a little bit lower margin on the sweetener side of the business there. we also had some operating challenges with the start-up of bulgaria in europe, which, again, this is an opportunity, frankly, speaking, for us in 2022, right? and we also had some higher energy costs over in europe as well.
as you know, natural gas prices ran up significantly in the back part of the year. so that impacted our energy costs over in europe, and that flowed through in terms of our starches and sweeteners segment. so there are a bunch of puts and takes that moved through the fourth quarter. again, we think a lot of that will be behind us because i think we've put ourselves -- put in a good hedge position for 2022.
and then also, we believe that we've got -- the bulgarian project, we've addressed a lot of those issues, and that should be a plus delta for us in 2022 as well.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that color is really helpful. thank you. and if i could just switch gears over to the nutrition segment.
and maybe help us think a little bit about the expectations for the business on an organic basis in 2022. i know there was a -- you did some m&a through the second half of 2021. so you talked to 10%-plus revenue growth and 15%-plus profit growth. can you help us think about the m&a contributions within that? and any specific parts of the business that you might be more optimistic than the segment average in areas where the growth might be a little below that?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think most of 2022 will be on an organic growth basis if you will. the contribution still of the acquisitions, it's going to happen a little bit later. these acquisitions are not made, to be honest, to -- for the acquisition of 2022.
as you recall, we are just building the nutrition business. so this is the strategic importance of positioning ourselves in the areas where we've been informing you. i think that we always like to have the policy of no surprises. and i think you heard me saying health & wellness is an area where we were going to invest, and that's where we did deerland pet food, and that's where we did petdine.
we continue to think about the incredible potential of plant-based proteins, and that's where we did soya protein, which is making us more international. and i talked about how powerful we are in flavors, but we were underrepresented, if you will, in the emerging markets. and that's why we invested in capacity in pinghu for flavors in china. and we also acquired fisa that gives us a beachhead into central america, caribbean, and maybe northern part of latin america.
so when we look at the business and our confidence in the 15%-plus organic operating profit growth is driven by our pipeline and our win rates, to be honest, that's why we look. our pipeline continues to increase. our product launches continues to increase and actually accelerate. and our win rates have almost doubled from one year to the other.
so the business is operating very well. we guided flat for q1 just because of the way some of the costs fall, and they are more front-loaded into next year. but this is a business. again, it's been growing 34%, 20%.
i think we're going to study life in the long term at this rate of 15%, 15% plus with double-digit organic growth basically without even touching the m&a for that.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. it's all really helpful. i'll pass it on. thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer

thank you. we now have a question from robert moskow of credit suisse. sir, robert, i have opened your line.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. congrats on a great year. and maybe you've kind of implied this already.
but your pricing for corn sweeteners in 2022, can you describe how the negotiations went? and it looks like what you're guiding to was kind of flattish profits in north america for corn sweeteners as a result of that pricing. is that a fair assessment?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah, rob. i mean our objective is really to maintain margins. and so through the course of the negotiations, i think it's fair to make an assumption that we've been able to maintain margins and offset the higher corn costs that has occurred recently. so i think we've achieved that objective, and that's a fair assumption to assume as we go into 2022.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and maybe a follow-up. the expansion of refined soybean oil is driven by the growing demand of renewable biodiesel. have you been watching the industry -- the planned industry expansion for all of those refineries? and what kind of -- is it achieving what you'd expect? are the -- is the capacity coming on line as expected? and is it having the results on demand for oil that you expected?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. of course, we keep a close eye into that. you have to understand that at this point in time, demand continues to outpace even the announced capacity expansions. but there is a reality also in this world of supply shortages and labor issues that projects are not that easy to execute.
so i think that when you look at the battery of announcements like the way we've seen, i think it's reasonable to put a percentage that is going to happen, either the reality or that they're all going to happen but in a little bit longer time line. so we tend to look at that from a long-term basis and maybe something like two-thirds or 75% will happen. at this point in time, we see the volume coming our way. and you have to remember that the original oil story, rob, it was due to tight palm oil around the world.
and that drove soybean oil and other oils up. and now on top of that, now we have the demand for rgd. so that -- now there is a full confluence of raw materials to be able to supply that oil. and so yes, we are looking at this very closely.
and at this point in time, everything is evolving as planned.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. all right. well, thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you, robert. we now have tom palmer of j.p. morgan. sir, tom, your line is open.
please go ahead.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. thank you for the questions and congratulations on the quarter.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tom.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
maybe i can follow up on rob's question just on the refined product's outlook and maybe a little more specific on how you're thinking about the setup for 2022. we do have kind of maybe the first larger wave of facilities coming on line with pretreatment units, at least back half-weighted, i think. so maybe what's the assumption for refined products this year? and do you think that that will -- that addition in terms of capacity is going to have much impact or, as you were kind of noting with rob, maybe just with timing and kind of needs of still sourcing from -- at least a portion from third parties, it won't be as impactful?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, tom. listen, we continue to believe we will add around 1 billion gallons per year of incremental r&d -- rgd capacity and approach that 5 billion gallons total capacity by 2025. and as i was selling rob, we continually restrain the announced capacity and analyze the market conditions. so we have several scenarios in this.
we do believe this announced capacity are important to -- and necessary to keep up with the expected demand growth for both vegetable oil, as i explained before, but also global meal demand needs. and at this point, vegetable oil consumption is still growing faster than supply. we've gotten a little bit good news from sun oil availability from the black sea that maybe will help bean oil tightness. and so regarding the pretreat comments, in the end, the vegetable oil will be required as a feedstock, and pricing will reflect the value of this feedstock, likely based on carbon intensity.
so we could see some shift in value between the crude oil and the refining. i think what we need to realize is we are at the early stages of this industry formation. so we're going to see some of those movements. and sometimes, we're going to capture the value in one place.
sometimes, we're going to capture the value in another one. but we are well-positioned. our biodiesel plants are all integrated in refineries and all that. so we are watching it very closely.
we feel good about how it's developing so far.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and maybe i'll segue with that to the crushing side. it seems like you're starting off the year with quite strong soy crush margins, perhaps higher than maybe you're guiding to for the year.
is there, i guess, catalyst or a driver that maybe makes margins weaker? is there a bit of conservatism embedded as we see headlines around lysine shortage? is that something you're expecting to kind of resolve itself and maybe see still a very favorable crush environment but a little more normalized versus to start off the year?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. there are many -- of course, it's a large industry, so many puts and takes. when we look at the demand side, the forecasted 2022 poultry production is going to be a record and near record for beef and hogs. so protein demand continues to grow around the world, and that's sustaining a lot.
there is a tight meat proteins and synthetic amino acids, and that's supporting soybean meal. remember, i mentioned fat is very expensive today and energy as well. so corn, at this point in time, is the cheapest carbohydrate. that's pulling soybean meal into the russian.
and we expect, at one point in time, the lysine market come maybe back into balance later in 2022. but still, the smds are very beneficial to soybean meal and to crush. so i think also, don't forget, rgd is also changing the dynamics for soybean meal, making soybean meal from the u.s. much more competitive and able to gain some export markets.
and when you have maybe a less-than-stellar soybean crop in argentina, argentina being such a strong exporter of meal, i think that bodes well for crush margins in north america and also in europe.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer

we now have the next question from vincent andrews of morgan stanley. sir, vincent, please ensure your line is not muted likely and you may go ahead.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is steve haynes on for vincent. i wanted to ask a question on the biosolutions business and the 100 million of annualized revenue in 2021. and if you could maybe just provide some more color on specific end markets where you're getting those wins and then how to think about the size of that going forward.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for the question, steve. listen, we are very excited about how that business is developing. i think we recognized in the past that that business happened almost -- while we were not watching, and it was a customer pull more than our push.
and now we have a segment approach to that. we have intentionality in developing that market. and that, as such, the opportunities have flourished. i would say a strong contribution from packaging; a strong contribution from fermentation, just we're helping other people that are creating some of these materials out of plant-based; personal and home care, very important segment that is growing; and a growing contribution from pharma, construction, and plant treatment.
so as you can tell, as we continue to deploy marketing resources into some of these segments, we continue to have success. so there are some segments that are more developed and larger for us and some segments that are more incipient. but i think it's going very well. we are working on the product mix as, sometimes, the growth is faster than our capacity.
so we're trying to accommodate that. and we're going to be having more capacity coming up soon to be able to sustain this 10% growth rate of revenue that we have.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst

thank you, steven. we now have ken zaslow of bmo capital markets. sir, ken, please go ahead when you're ready.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ray young -- chief financial officer
hey, ken.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
let me just take a different approach. when you think about your -- you talk about all the things that are happening on the demand side, but at your analyst day, you kind of did talk about the cost structure increasing and that there were going to be some headwinds. as i look forward, these headwinds don't seem to be materializing to the extent. or are they? and can you frame how you kind of put it during the analyst day and where you see they are going through -- no, what are you seeing now, where you see them to 2022? and are you really seeing them develop the way you thought they were? or are they a little bit lower than you thought?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. the dynamics here, ken, of course, is we have forecasted or accounted for some -- the potential reversion of margins and some inflation, of course, that we were going to have. and that is difficult to estimate, the timing. and then we have productivity and innovation that is going to be growing in their impact as some of these projects develop.
so when we look at, if you will, at the negative side of the equation, at the positive side, we can control. on the negative side, we've put together several scenarios. and i would say the biggest manifestation of that, at this point in time, has been energy inflation and inflation from some smaller products. we suffer probably more of this and some supply change disruptions and labor shortages that you probably hear every company talking about.
i would say from an energy perspective, the impact is probably more on europe, whether it's on crush or carb solutions. that's where we see the impact. and we have our team basically working on energy efficiency and shaving some percentages of that increase and also our hedging mechanisms and all that. on the raw material side and the supply chain disruption, that's probably more the territory of nutrition.
nutrition, as you can imagine, have more variety of raw materials and more skus. so the complexity of that business makes it more exposed to some of these winds. so that's the way we're looking at that. it's more the european energy increase and some of the nutrition one-offs that are here and there on supply chain.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
my second question is -- and i appreciate that. on the china side, i think the last call or the call before, you kind of outlined how the demand is growing. i know 2021 was an extraordinary year for china's demand. how do you think that's going to play out in 2022 and 2023 in terms of -- will there be a mix change? will there be increased demand? how do you kind of think about it relative to your business model? and i appreciate your time as always.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ken. listen, we think that china has recovered from the asf. they recovered [inaudible].
and you saw the dynamics in terms of pork prices coming up and down. we still believe that they will import some -- they will import soybeans in the high 90s, 96, 97 million, give or take, and around probably 25 million tons of corn. again, when -- we are watching the way they are managing through covid challenges, but we expect demand will continue to grow. it continues to be supported by improved diets and professional feeding practices.
even if we see some moderation of gdp, we think that -- we've seen per capita consumption of the top four meat basically increases. and even if they corrected a little bit -- they correct versus 2021, they are still much bigger than pre-asf and pre-pandemic. so we can fit it with the numbers here or there, but still, it's going to be very strong. and as i said, probably 96, 97 million of soybeans, 25 million of corn, that will provide a good base for the grain industry and the crushing industry.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. thank you again.

thank you, ken. we now have a question from ben kallo from baird. sir, ben, please go ahead when you're ready.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. ray, you touched on the regulatory environment just in your ethanol comments, but maybe just on a broader level just maybe around renewable diesel, if you guys could talk about that. and then on the legislative front, i hate to ask because it's anyone's best guess, but how do you see maybe the blender's tax credit and anything around aviation fuel evolving? thank you.
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah. on the biodiesel, as you know, the current blender's credit continues until the end of 2022, december 31st, 2022. so we're -- actually, we're looking at what's happening on the legislative agenda in washington on the bbb program to see whether it gets renewed. but historically, what you've seen is the -- both -- frankly, both parties are supportive of the biodiesel industry.
it's important for united states. so even if something doesn't occur on bbb, we're optimistic that the blender's credit will get extended in one way or another through some form of legislation as we kind of move through the year. and if you recall, sometimes it happens after you get through the end of the year and then you have a retroactive biodiesel tax credit, which we've seen in the past. so we actually feel confident that something will occur there in order to kind of continue with the blender's credit on the biodiesel tax credit.
on the saf front, as you know, this is something that we're working on right now with different partners. it is going to be an important part of the fuel industry in the future as we go green in terms of aviation fuel. so just based upon frankly, again, the support we see in terms of the direction of saf, we're optimistic that some form of legislative -- yeah, some form of legislative actions to be taken to support the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the saf industry. and again, it's a nascent industry right now, right? very few gallons are being produced, but projections show that by 2030, there's going to be a need for about 4 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in combination of the united states and europe.
so it's a significant growth industry, and probably, there's going to be some level of support required in order to start up this industry here.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
and just on the -- back to the renewable front, could you just talk about any areas that you're watching? i know we talked about the supply side and how you discount these new production facilities coming online. but can you talk about the demand side and where you're seeing the incremental demand coming from, the regions that we already know out there new regions? thank you and thanks for all the answers.
ray young -- chief financial officer
i mean the demand side is really driven by the different states implementing low-carbon fuel standards, lcfs standards, particularly starting out in the west, but frankly, it's going to get extended across all of the united states and canada. so the demand side is there, right, as all the states move toward lcfs standards. and frankly, the industry is just simply trying to respond to that demand by building the supply to meet that particular requirement there.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we now have a question from steve byrne from bank of america. sir, steve, please go ahead. i have opened your line.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. do you think that soybean oil will represent the majority of the feedstock for these 5 billion gallons of renewable diesel?
ray young -- chief financial officer
it's going to represent an important part of it. i mean as demand rolls for renewable green diesel, it's going to require the pull for many sorts of feedstocks. and in fact, it's very likely that even canola oil will find a pathway eventually to become part of a feedstock for renewable green diesel. but we still believe that maybe about 45% of the production will come from soybean oil, eventually a small production out of the canola oil that i referenced here.
so it is going to be an important component because there's just insufficient amount of that they used cooking oil and other types of feedstock, fats, and renderings. there's just not enough supply in order to kind of meet this growing demand.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
believing your 45% is 30 million acres of incremental soybeans, which i don't think is going to happen, does that mean soybean exports get squeezed out and, instead, it gets crushed, the oil goes into r&d and you export the meal?
ray young -- chief financial officer
we've indicated we believe that a lot of the u.s. soybean oil exports will actually come down. you're correct. i think there's going to be a diversion away from exports to soybean oil.
there could also be some diversions away from even food applications. there's going to be a daisy chain effect that goes on, which frankly is actually supportive for the entire vegetable oil complex around the world, right? so i think there is going to be some daisy chain effects that are going on in order to kind of meet this type of demand.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then what about your slide 15 where you show forward sales by farmers in south america being below historical averages? do you attribute that to the uncertainty that they are seeing with their current crop, just from either drought or excessive rain? and if grain and oilseed production is lower there in 2022 or the rest of the world for that matter, is that a net benefit to you in trading?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, this is juan. so what you're seeing from the farmer in south america is reflective of both things: one is the current impact in south america; and the second is, as you see, they are looking at the -- what happened with the size of the crop. in terms of whether it's beneficial for adm or not, our role is to try to fulfill our mission of providing nutrition around the world, and that's where we use our supply chain to make sure that we deliver to our customers and we deliver to the populations around the world. so sometimes, it coincides with margin expansion in some parts of the business.
sometimes, it may not. we like the fact that there is a strong demand around the world, and that tends to be good for adm.

yeah. good morning. just wanted to sort of get your take on kind of the current transportation system and the outlook at the ports. both at new orleans, are we fully recovered from the hurricanes and then kind of the barge system? and what's happening over in the ports in china? and what's sort of the backup? and your business -- is this kind of flowing normally? or how backed up is it?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, michael, good question. talk about -- let's talk about china. some slight covid-related challenges in china are impacting ports. but to be honest, the situation has improved.
initially, we got the highlights. but in general, port situation continues to improve. and maybe we have average waiting about two, three days for bulk cargo in agriculture in most main ports. so i would say china is kind of ok.
we've seen lineups or the moorage time increasing in brazil. they're still both exporting corn and importing fertilizers. and since the soybean crop is a little bit delayed, we're seeing more -- we're seeing waiting times kind of doubled from maybe 15 days to 30 days in brazil. and that's pushing some volume into north america for maybe march, april deliveries.
north america export capacity has recovered for the most part. i think there is one plan that was going to have some long-term or medium-term, if you will, repairments. but for the most part, the export capacity has been recovered to pre-ida level at least for us. and i would say in terms of the river, the illinois river, there is a lot of freezing, and there is a lot of icy conditions that have slowed down the river movement.
and we see that, and that probably will happen -- will continue.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then just as a follow-up, what's the elevation margin outlook as you guys kind of see it for the year? thanks.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've seen -- as you know, we have the impact of ida in the q4. we had the demand, but we didn't have the ability to supply. so a lot of that volume was moved into q1. and we have seen the elevation margins increasing in q1, so a little bit as expected.
and so we feel good about how to satisfy that demand.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from eric of seaport research partners. sir, eric, please go ahead.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thank you. thanks for squeezing me in, everybody. congrats on a great quarter.
great year, everyone. so i know this has kind of been beaten to death, and it's -- obviously, it's very important. so if you -- if again, on the renewable -- if you just take a renewable green diesel market, if you just look at the amount of feedstock that's required to meet to kind of get to that 2025 goal, your goal of 5 billion gallons, it's -- and i think it was alluded to earlier with that 45% comment, it's 30 million acres of increased -- it's the equivalent of 30 million acres of soybean production, which it just isn't going to happen. so -- and i'm sure -- and i know that greg and chris are all over this.
the -- doesn't this -- if you -- it's got to be -- it is a global market. it will be. doesn't this just feed right into your -- into a very positive long-term outlook for ag services that you're going to have to be able to pull globally a lot of resources in to meet these demand functions, but that's what makes it possible. is that the way to look at this?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, eric, when you have one explosion of demand in one place of the world, resources from around the world will come. and as ray was saying, maybe we're going to export less. certainly, we may import more.
and there are going to shift between the different products. so i would say we continue to be in a world that requires more food and also that requires to help the environment. it has been a structural change in demand for us. and for a company that have assets around the world, that probably means better utilization of those assets and better value of those assets as we try to solve these issues, yes.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
good. and so the final question i have, and a lot of those have been answered already. so when you -- when we look at the current year in terms of u.s. crop production, so what are you hearing from your former clients? obviously, it looks like we're putting a bid in the corn markets today to get more corn production.
there's a lot of uncertainty with input costs and all the other stuff. what is your feel for how -- and it's early, but it's not so early anymore. it's getting closer to time. what is your feel on how the crop production outlook looks for this year kind of by crop?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we expect a strong u.s. planting. of course, some of those decisions, as you said, is getting the time to make those decisions.
and a lot of people are looking at the south american weather. south american weather is very strange at the moment. there's very dry conditions in paraná or the south of brazil and maybe argentina. and it was a little bit too wet in the north.
numbers in the north are coming strong in terms of yield for brazil. i think that the recent rains have stopped the deterioration of the crop in argentina and the south of brazil and probably with paraguay having already felt the damage. so we believe in the u.s. we still believe that probably corn will outpace soybeans in terms of acres.
so we probably think about, i don't know, something like 93 million acres of corn, 87 million acres of soybean, give or take. and i understand the dynamics about fertilizers and all that. but i think given the prices of last year, i think that the prime land will probably maintain the same mix.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yep. no, i would agree with you. thank you, juan. again, congratulations on a great year.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer

i will now turn the call over to juan. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vikram. our team delivered a super fourth quarter. this morning, we reported record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.50. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020.
our trailing four-quarter adjusted ebitda was $4.9 billion, $1.25 billion more than a year ago. and our trailing four-quarter average adjusted roic was 10%, meeting our objectives. slide 4, please. that performance represented a strong finish to an outstanding 2021.
for the full year, our adjusted eps was $5.19, also a record. and full year adjusted segment operating profit was $4.8 billion. this excellent performance was reflected across the company. the ag services and oilseeds team's actions to improve their business portfolio and strengthen their operating model continued to enable superior performance in a strong market environment.
as&o delivered full year 2021 op of $2.8 billion, with each subsegment performing at or near historic highs. carbohydrate solutions executed phenomenally well to deliver full year operating profits of $1.3 billion. and the team is continuing the evolution of carbohydrate solutions from the sale of our peoria dry mill and the announcement of the sustainable aviation fuel mou; to our agreement with lg chem and the continued growth of our exciting biosolutions platform, which delivered new revenue wins with an annualized run rate of almost $100 million; to the project we announced earlier this month to further decarbonize our operations by connecting two other major processing facilities; to our vacate of carbon capture and storage capabilities. the nutrition team once again delivered industry-leading revenue and op growth, with full year revenues up 16% and full year op of $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase.
we also continued to enhance our nutrition business with strategic investments targeted at growing areas of demand, including soya protein, which will expand our participation in alternative proteins; petdine, which substantially enhance our presence in pet food and treats; deerland, which continued the expansion of our functional probiotics and enzymes portfolio within our global health & wellness business; and fisa, which enhance our flavor footprint by opening up new growth opportunities in latin america and the caribbean. slide 5, please. last month, at our global investor day, we unveiled our strategic plan and reiterated our balanced financial framework for value creation, including using our strong cash flows to deliver both growth investments and distributions to shareholders. we are confident in our plan [audio gap] which is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.
we are proud of our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and more than 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are pleased to continue to follow through on our commitment to shareholder value creation. it's been a great year, and we're excited about what's to come. our continued actions to build a better adm and dynamically align it with the global trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability, and the steadfast advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives will help propel our 2022 results. i will talk in more detail about the upcoming calendar year shortly.
but first, i'd like to turn the call over to ray to review our business performance. ray?
ray young -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, juan. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. slide 6, please.
the ag services and oilseeds team capped off really a truly impressive year, successfully navigating through supply chain challenges to deliver results largely in line with the extremely strong prior-year quarter. the ag services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of china. global trade was substantially higher year over year, driven by solid risk management and improved results in global ocean freight. overall, ag services delivered strong results, just slightly off the outstanding fourth quarter of 2020 when we benefit from exceptionally high export margins.
crushing executed well on the continued solid demand environment for both soybean meal and vegetable oil. lower results in emea versus a very strong fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately $250 million in net negative timing impacts versus negative $125 million in the prior-year quarter drove overall results lower year over year. the majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022. the refined products and other teams delivered substantially higher results versus the prior-year period, driven by strong volumes and margins in north america for refined oils and improved biodiesel margins in north america and emea, which more than offset weaker south american results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate.
equity earnings from wilmar were higher year over year. looking ahead, we expect a strong first quarter from ag services and oilseeds, higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with the just-ended fourth quarter. slide 7, please. carbohydrate solutions' fourth quarter results were more than double the prior-year quarter.
in starches and sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher input costs, including energy costs in emea as well as lower wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins. volumes for north america sweeteners and starches were largely flat year over year. vantage corn processor results were again substantially higher year over year, driven by historically strong industry ethanol margins as a result of strong demand relative to supply as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the two dry mills that were idle in the previous year period. as we look ahead, we believe the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021.
slide 8, please. the nutrition business closed out a year of consistent and strong growth, with fourth quarter revenues 19% higher year over year, 21% on a constant currency basis, with 26% higher profits year over year, and sustained strong ebitda margins. human nutrition had a great fourth quarter, with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits. flavors continued its growth trajectory, driven primarily by improved product mix in emeai and continued strong performance from north america, partially offset by weaker apac results.
in specialty ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year-ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of onetime insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020. health & wellness was higher versus the prior-year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation. animal nutrition revenue was up 21% on a constant currency basis, and operating profit was much higher year over year, driven primarily by continued strength in amino acids. now looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue to grow operating profits at a 15%-plus rate for calendar year 2022, with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021 with continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs upfront in the year and the absence of the onetime benefits we saw in the first quarter of the prior year.
slide 9, please. now let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. other business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by higher captive insurance underwriting results as the prior-year quarter included larger intracompany insurance settlements. for calendar year 2022, we expect other business results to be similar to 2021.
although for the first quarter, we expect a loss of about $25 million due to insurance settlements currently planned. net interest expense increased year over year on higher short-term borrowings. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year over year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher it offering in project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. we anticipate calendar year 2022 total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated, and other corporate, to be in line with the $1.2 billion area, consistent with what i discussed at global investor day with net interest roughly similar, corporate unallocated a bit higher, and corporate other a bit lower.
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 21%, compared to 8% in the prior year. the calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17%, up from 5% in 2020. the increase for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, primarily valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments. looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16 to 19%.
our balance sheet remains solid, with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 28% and available liquidity of about $9 billion. with that, let me turn it back to juan. juan?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ray. slide 10, please. i hope most of you were able to join us on our global investor day last month. there, we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy from our work to improve roic through capital cost and cash; to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments, including the creation of a global nutrition business; to today's focus on productivity and innovation.
thanks to this work, we are moving into 2022 with a better adm, a more returns-focused organization with higher margins and less volatile earnings, and a portfolio that is well-positioned to capitalize on the positive structural changes being driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability. slide 11, please. let me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment. in ag services and oilseeds, we see a continued favorable global demand environment.
due to a short growth in south america, with the magnitude of the shortfall still to be determined, we expect global ag commodity buyers will rely relatively more on the u.s. market for their needs, assuming we have a normal u.s. crop later this year. on the oilseeds side, we're starting 2022 with strong soy crush margins.
and as we discussed at global investor day, we believe that increasing demand for meal as well as vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable green diesel should continue to support the positive environment this year, with our soy crush margins in the range of 45 to $55 per metric ton. assuming these dynamics play out, we believe that ag services and oilseeds in 2022 has the potential to deliver operating profit similar to or better than 2021. for carbohydrate solutions, we are assuming the demand and margin environment for our starch and sweetener products will be steady versus 2021. we expect the industry ethanol environment to continue to be constructive, supported by the recovery of domestic demand to pre-covid levels, energy costs driving higher exports, and better clarity on the regulatory landscape.
with this in mind, we're assuming higher adm ethanol volumes and ebitda margins to average $0.15 to $0.25 for the calendar year. in addition, we are expecting our biosolutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business. putting it all together, we expect carbohydrate solutions to deliver full year operating profit slightly lower than their outstanding 2021. in nutrition, we're expecting continued growth in demand for our unparalleled portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits of accretion from our recent acquisitions.
with these dynamics, we expect 15-plus percent op growth in 2022, revenue growth above 10%, and ebitda margins above 20% in human nutrition and high single digits in animal nutrition, consistent with targets we set out at our global investor day. slide 12, please. so as we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio. and then we add to that thing we can do better.
our execution was great in 2021, but we're always identifying opportunities for improvement. and we intend to do even more to meet this growing demand in 2022. put it all together, and we're optimistic for another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress toward our strategic plans next earnings milestones of six to $7 per share. with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
",2021-Q4,ADM
-0.6557,0.9172,,,":
operator
thank you very much. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. adam, your line is open. 
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning, everyone. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, adam. 
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. so i want to -- vikram, i guess first question. just as we think about the current market environment, obviously, a tremendous number of moving pieces, i guess i'm trying to calibrate some of the things that could prove more enduring to the business. and the one that sticks out, i mean, is inflation broadly.
and i'm thinking about energy costs and what that -- especially in europe, thinking about construction costs for new plants. i'm just trying to think, specifically in oilseeds, how higher operating costs in europe, higher replacement costs as we're thinking about new builds, how that might be impacting oilseed crush margins around the world? and do you think that has a bit longer tail to it? and i would think that benefits you, given your footprint is principally in the americas.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
yeah, adam. thanks for the question. yeah, in terms of energy costs, clearly, we are not immune to that and we've seen an elevation in energy costs. as you well know, we have a program to actively hedge our program.
so i think to a large degree, we've been successful in doing that. nevertheless, in places like europe, where energy costs have been significantly elevated, yes, that's had an impact on net margins. but as you look at the broader dynamics, we continue to see very strong outlook in terms of vegetable demand a's well as protein demand. and as you see, most of the grain flows, given what's happening around the world, particularly in the black sea region and the short south american crop moving to north america, that should actually support us in terms of our footprint.
so the structural changes associated with rgd remained very much intact. so we think longer term, we feel very confident about the move higher that we cited in the global investor day in terms of crush margins. and for 2022, in particular, we see even more strength, given some of the near-term dynamics i just referenced.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then i guess the second question is more on capital on the balance sheet, and i think it was impressive to see in the quarter the growth in inventory. you have the committed credit capacity basically being unchanged from year end.
and i'm wondering how you think about that as a strategic asset and the opportunities it presents both in terms of merchandising and risk in the short term, but also if the m&a pipeline is maybe improving as some others may not have the liquidity that you do in the current high commodity environment?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
yeah, adam, we clearly view our balance sheet as a competitive advantage. and in terms of capital allocation, we've talked about this before. our capital allocation is inextricably linked to our strategy. in terms of the guidelines, in terms of the framework, we've articulated about 30% to 40% of our cash flow as we all direct toward capital expenditures, and the remaining 60% to 70% for strategic growth investments.
and given our balance sheet flexibility, we are clearly in a position to undertake some of those growth investments, including m&a, if that becomes attractive. but also shareholder distributions, including 30% to 40% toward dividends. as we cited in global investor day, we expect dividend payouts to be actually at the higher end of that 30% to 40% range in the near to medium term. but at the end of the day, if you step back, think about the operating cash flow we generated, $1.6 billion in q1.
so we should be in a position to conduct meaningful buybacks as well in the medium term, as we noted in the global investor day. in the near term, we will repurchase shares to at least offset dilution.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. that color is all really helpful. i'll pass it on. thank you. 
operator
our next question is from ben theurer from barclays. ben, please go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much. juan, vikram, congrats on the strong results. i wanted to ask a question around just the global freight and global trade environment, and obviously, with some of the backlog that's been caused on unloading ships over in china because of all the lockdowns.
have you seen or are you seeing any incremental disruptions over the last couple of weeks that you think is going to cost greater opportunities for you guys within the next coming weeks to excel here, and to ultimately deliver a strong quarter on the ex-service piece, just similarly to what we saw already in 1q?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ben. good morning. of course, we've been dealing with supply chain issues for a while, and i think that the situation in china has nothing more than just bring back more challenges, if you will.
we see the number of ships in congestion, if you will, from capesize, panamax, supramax, and handysize have increased over the last week, increases about 10% give or take, depending on the category. so i think that's especially complicated as you see that because of the different conflicts and different shortages in crops that we have, some of these trading flows around the world that are being redirected. so you redirect trading flows with maybe less ship availability and higher freight and longer travel times. so the situation continued to be dire, and that's why it's so important to have a team, a global team, very active with many options to provide supply and then to reach different destinations.
so the combination, if you will, of our global trade with the destination marketing and all that, becomes more and more important every day for customers around the world.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you very much. i'll leave it here, so you can stay on track.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ben. 
operator
the next question comes from the line of tom palmer with j.p. morgan. tom, please go ahead with your question. 
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. thank you for the question. maybe just a follow-up on the outlook for the second quarter in the as&o segment, maybe just a little commentary on the subsegment expectations. are you expecting year-over-year profit increases across all three of the subsegments? are there any to call out of particular strength?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say our first quarter was -- showed strength across the three businesses, very good performance. and as we look at q2, probably we see the same. there was some reduction in exports in ag services in the first quarter because of weather issues and some of that has been moved into the second quarter, so we have a good book there.
china has put some orders also for corn q2 and q3, we expect crush profits to continue to be very strong in the second quarter. certainly, refining margins also very good. so i would say demand has been domestically strong for soybean meal in north america and certainly, a lot of demand around the world for that. so we continue to see crush very well supported by the oil and the meal.
we continue to see demand for our exports in the second quarter. so had the window effects for north america, we will have expanded a little bit. and certainly, the refining materials are -- they've maintained very strong margins. if you look at last year, we entered into q1 with low margins and we ended with strong margins.
this year has been strong margins across the quarter, and we expect that to continue into the second quarter.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from ken zaslow from bank of montreal. 
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
good morning, ken. 
operator
apologies, we have lost ken [inaudible] from stephens. ben, your line is open. 
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ben. 
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
morning. 
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i want to ask about the nutrition business. strong results in the first quarter, you noted it. versus the prior expectation of 15% plus, now 20% growth for the year. you called out acquisition contribution or the performance of acquisitions.
is that a fair breakdown of organic versus inorganic growth, thinking about maybe 15% organic growth plus 5% inorganic? or how would you delineate between the two contributing factors?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
well, so as we talked about -- i referenced in my comments, ben, the revenue growth, right, was 23% and if you exclude m&a and adjusted for fx, it was 17%. so strong revenue growth frankly, across human nutrition and animal nutrition. the reason our profits were stronger than what we had guided in q4 were threefold. one is, we did expect some upfront costs that we cited, and we had anticipated inflationary cost pressures and supply disruptions.
however, with the smart pricing and active supply chain collaboration with our as&o carb solutions teams, we manage these very well across all the nutrition businesses. the other aspect is we talked about industry-leading win rates in our global investor day. actually, our win rates are even expanding beyond that. and the second point is, as you referenced, the op contribution from our m&a were actually higher than expected.
the third point is amino acids. because of the deliberate switch we made from dry to liquid lysine last year, combined with the strong north american protein demand and the supply chain disruptions, our contribution from amino acids business was actually higher. so really, it's a reflection of those three factors that resulted in higher-than-expected nutrition profit for q1.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok, great. i'll get back in the queue. thanks. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ben.
operator
we do have a question on the line now from ken zaslow with bank of montreal. ken, please go ahead. 
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ken. 
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
good morning. 
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
when i think about longer term, you guys set out two targets: one, high single-digit growth, and then the $6 to $7 outlook by 2025. given the operating environment, i know you just literally just put this out, so it's hard to change it on a change of environment. but how do you see that? do you think that the growth rate is higher? or do you think that the ability to get to the $6 to $7 comes earlier than expected given the favorable operating environment?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ken. good question. listen, when we put the plan in front of shareholders in december, we're just -- mostly to explain how our company and our business model and portfolio continues to evolve, aligning ourselves with markets of higher growth rates and actually higher margins.
and so what we can control, as you can imagine, is a portfolio, capital allocation, and our execution, so we focus on that. so directionally, we're going into that, and we just put a milestone there to have a reference for investors. of course, at this point in time, we're going to hit those numbers earlier. it is obvious.
but i think we don't worry that much of the pace. it's more important for us the direction we're going is higher margins, higher growth rates. the pace, sometimes, is dictated for outside events in which our team and their execution are supposed to capitalize as much as possible into them. so do you ask me, it's going to be $6 to $7 in 2025? certainly, it's going to happen sooner than that.
but again, i think it's important to keep the team, continue to build that better company. with vikram's explain how we have generated $1.6 billion of cash flow in this, that gives us much more optionality on how much to accelerate that shift of the company into higher margin and higher growth rates. and to be honest, after we have created nutrition and nutrition, we continue to upgrade targets even if they make $700 million last year, we are now focusing on building the next scale business. we're looking at microbial solutions and how that will drive the next generation of food and proteins.
we're looking at climate solutions or biosolutions, which will drive the next generation of sustainable products. and also microbiome modulators, which with the pre, pro and postbiotics, will drive personalized health and nutrition. and let me remind you and the shareholders, contributions for all these three elements that we're thinking on building was basically muted during the forecast that we showed in the december global investor day. so we feel very good about the existing business is delivering $6 to $7 maybe earlier than expected, but we having the capabilities to build the next-scale business for adm.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up question is when i think about the renewable diesel and the way it's going to happen and with the backdrop of inflation, how does the balance between the renewable diesel kind of going versus the potential for inflation to curtail that? or do you see that renewals of diesel already -- the horse is already out of the barn, that that momentum is going to continue, versus is there a potential that the inflation can kind of either elongate the timing of it or delay anything? and then i'll leave it there, and i appreciate your time.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ken. good questions as always. listen, first of all, let me say on that that i'm very proud that our team -- and remember, when we announced spiritwood, we said we've been looking at that for two years. so we took into consideration all these aspects, and -- so our product remains to be -- remains on schedule to deliver on the harvest 2023.
so most important, what we can control. that project is going well, and we're managing through inflations and delays, so proud of the team there. listen, at the end of the day, we still expect the significant new capacity will come online. of course, when there are so many announcements in any industry, you're going to have a percentage of that being -- coming on a stream.
i think that there may be some variability on the timing of all that. it doesn't escape anybody that there are labor availability issues, especially in the u.s. certainly, raw materials, whether it's steel or energy or whatever, are more expensive than whenever some of these things were announced, and maybe the builders of this hedge, the raw materials exposure, or both things in anticipation. but i would say if there is some delay, it may not be bad to allow crush expansions to actually come on stream so they can provide the soybean oil for all these plants to run, and we also wait for canola to have a path to that.
so i think, listen, the industry will develop. it may have some short-term issues here or there, but at the end of the day, a significant piece of new demand for soybean oil is being built and will be built.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ken.

our next question is from steve byrne from bank of america. your line is open. 
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you. given those comments you just made there, juan, about the outlook for renewable diesel, and you also had comments in your slide deck about your own views about the demand growth for alternative meat and dairy which could potentially lead to less demand for soybean meal. i'm curious to hear your own view on, do you see any challenge here meeting what might be a disparate growth in demand for the oil versus the meal side of all of these crush plants that are going to be built?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no. listen, it's a very good question. and we look at that, of course, with a lot of attention.
i think right now, when we see the capacity coming, it's all capacity needed actually to supply the growth of protein around the world. we see north america with very strong domestic demand for meal, but we see also north america soybean meal being the most competitive around the world. especially now when you have issues in argentina with some changes in dt, when you have short crops in south america, like we have had, and we continue to have a strong demand. we see also that customers are relatively open, so there's not a lot of inventory in the chain that at one point needs to be flushed out.
and when you look at what happened with feed and competitive feeds, certainly wheat, given the conflict in ukraine, the unfortunate conflict in ukraine, wheat prices need to go up high enough that they get out of the feeding rations so they can be preserved to feeding people. when you take that up, you bring corn, the most effective carbohydrate, and corn immediately brings soybean meal into the russia. so we not only see strong demand, but we see high inclusion rates staying. and again, given the strong leg of soybean oil in north america, that will make soybean meal the most competitive in the world.
so we actually are very positive about that demand, and we think that we need all the expansion to match the market share that soybean meal north america will take from the rest of the world.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good. thank you, juan. maybe just one more on the oil side and that is, what do you see as the global impacts of indonesia's ban on palm oil exports? how does that affect the global supply of oil and your business in particular?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. you know oils have been tied for several months already, if not a year. and of course, any announcement in the -- in the proximity of the largest producer of palm oil in the world rattles the market. of course, it was immediately clarified that this doesn't include crude palm oil, which is the biggest product.
so i would say i think indonesia is just trying to take a short-term palliative for their domestic inflation. i don't think it will significantly alter the global balances, although the global balances continue to be very tight. and any disruption, we have the ukrainian disruption, of course, with -- and the russia with sunflower oil. so this is an area that everybody has to pay a lot of attention.
and it will require companies like adm to having the ability to reformulate, so we can take some customers that are existing customers of either palm oil or sunflower oil to have alternatives to continue to supply their customers. so we are seeing that through our -- on the next joint venture. we're seeing that through our stratas joint venture, so -- and we've seen the opportunity to add a lot of value to some of the customers that are looking for replacements at this point in time.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from robert moskow from credit suisse. robert, please go ahead with your question. 
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you. i was wondering if you could give us a little insight into your visibility into crush margins in the second half of this year? are your customers locking in their commitments for demand and supplying you yet? and can you use that to lock in those margins? and then i have a quick follow-up, if i could.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, rob. as i said, i think that we have very strong visibility, of course, into q2. i would say further than that, i think customers -- the markets are inverted, so customers see prices relatively high right now.
those customers that are not covered, they feel like maybe the course is showing them that they can get covered later at the cheaper rate than today. so i would say, in general, we have coverage for the next quarter, not for q3 or q4. but when we look at the demand that we are seeing around the world, we think that when you think about meal and oil in general, not only in north america but also brazil, the crush margins need to be there to encourage the crushers to crush. we need the demand for oil and we need the soybean meal, so you will have to have the demand -- the crush margins to incentivate people to crush.
and we are seeing that with the margins that are happening in brazil or the u.s. or europe, all our margins today are higher than what we anticipated. and we think that as the year rollout and demand continues to be solid out there and strong, crush margins will continue to send that signal to all the fast crushers which is, we need the meal, we need the oil, keep crushing.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and just a follow-up. you mentioned ocean freight being a big benefit, and i think it had to do with some redirecting of ships in china related to lockdowns. but i'm sure it also has to do with just overall moving freight from one destination to another and shifting directions.
can i assume that that is a big benefit to you, and that could continue for the rest of '22? or is it kind of like more episodic in nature?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob, we have -- as part of our global trade group, we have a strong ocean freight group. and they work hand in glove to make sure that we continue to serve the customers with the most effective destinations, the most efficient destinations. so we are the big player, and as a big player with a lot of resources, we tend to have a relative advantage to others. so when things get complicated, and right now, they are very complicated, we tend to have a relative higher competitive advantage than others.
so i think that shows in the margins there that we obtaining this. and logistics right now are complicated. they are complicated in the river, they are complicated in the oceans, and there is a lot of redrawing of trade flows. and you can only redraw a lot of trade flows if you have a lot of origin options and a lot of destination options, because you need to connect both.
and our ocean freight group counts with that blessing, which is adm, originates in all the key parts of the world and have destination units in all key parts of the world. so it provides them with more ability to play routes than maybe other players.

our next question comes from vincent andrews from morgan stanley. vincent, your line is open. 
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, everyone, and congratulations to vikram and ray on your new roles, and ray, it was great to work with you all those years. juan, could i ask you just to talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the consumer and consumer demand maybe particularly in europe, but i guess also globally? just given we have a lot of food inflation, we have a lot of energy inflation. what do you think gives? clearly, we need to destroy some demand just given how tight supply is. but how are you thinking about that equation this year into next year?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, we are paying, of course, close attention to that. at this point in time, we haven't seen any significant impact on demand for us. if you think about -- so far, customers are paying higher prices, but they still -- especially in north america, they still haven't changed their behaviors.
we think that, of course, if you have disposable income suffering from higher gas prices and higher food prices, eventually they will have to adjust. we have seen more, to be honest, vincent, in the -- some of the emerging markets in which maybe food is a bigger percentage of their disposable income. so we have seen some adjustments, small adjustment in that. but i would say, at this point in time, we have not seen any relevant or material adjustment to our demand.
and we think that given the pent-up demand that existed from recovery of the coming out of covid, people, in general, have been higher -- having higher saving rates. and we have seen wage inflation around the world that have gotten more money in the pockets of many. so at this point in time, we think consumer has been -- and demand has been very resilient. but there's going to be a point in which disposable income will get tight, and we will see some changes into that.
we haven't seen it yet. we don't see it in the immediate future either.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, vincent.

our next question comes from michael piken from cleveland research. michael, please go ahead. 
michael piken -- cleveland research company -- analyst
yeah, hi. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the avian flu here in the u.s., as well as internationally, and what that might look like in terms of the impact from meal demand? 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, michael, we haven't seen at this point in time any significant impact to our poultry demand in north america. the numbers at this point in time seems to be about half the size of the issue that was in 2015. so it's something we're following very closely, of course, but we cannot say that we have had an impact so far.
and hopefully, these virus are difficult to control. so of course, there is a lot of sanitary elements being thrown at that. hopefully, i would blockade, but we will have to keep a close eye to that.
michael piken -- cleveland research company -- analyst
great. and a follow-up question, just shifting gears. are you concerned about the movement of fertilizers throughout the world? i know you have a fertilizer business. but beyond that, just the impact if we do end up in a really tight grain environment.
are you -- how do you think, if there is a food versus fuel debate, how do you see that sort of playing out? and is there any risk to the ethanol volumes or the growth in biodiesel, or how do you sort of see that playing out? thanks. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. on fertilizers, to be honest, michael, of course, fertilizer supply chains are tight and it's been highly publicized. however, we get -- our evidence shows that trade lanes are adapting and markets are getting sufficient supply to fertilizer, of course, at much higher prices than they would -- drive prices for grain. i think today, especially brazil, the u.s.
certainly has the fertilizer for this crop. so the question is the brazilian crop, which is coming in a few months. and i think it's still possible what we get from our people in brazil to get enough potassium fertilizer in country by the planting season. and of course, any shortages can produce production losses.
but at this point in time, when people are thinking between maybe 15% or 20% less application, at that level, we don't think that we're going to see a significant change in the production forecast. it's probably more depending on weather at this point in time and rain than fertilizer application. and the second was on food versus fuel. at this point in time, i think that we are committed to try to help the world with food and the environment, so they're both axis of the same equation.
i would say they both touch disposable income. as i was saying before, if you get ethanol to reduce the cost of gasoline, that creates more disposable income to take on food inflation. if you take -- if you don't put any biofuels into gasoline and you pay more for gasoline, then you may get cheaper food, but you have less disposable income there. so to be honest, i think the molecules react to the prices that they are giving in the market, given the different regulations and the different values.
and what we try to be is as efficient as possible, bringing as much of those -- as many of those molecules to the market as possible to satisfy everybody. so i think at this point in time, we have seen some corrections in certain biofuels mandates across the world. but in other countries, it has been only a reduction and not an elimination. so this, i think, with the short-term things -- because we still have the climate crisis, which is a long-term objective that -- mostly the transportation industry, but also every industry will have to address, and biofuel or sustainable aviation fuels and all that are a big part of that reduction.
operator
our next question comes from eric larson from seaport research partners. eric, please go ahead. 
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah, thanks. congratulations, everybody. and vikram, i congratulate you on your new role. and ray, you as well, i look forward to working with both of you on that, so congrats.
so listening to the call today, juan, i hear -- as all of us, there's a lot of confusion, there's a lot of moving parts. so when i look back 10 weeks ago, i realized that u.s. grain prices had to move higher in order to even kind of -- even begin to maybe ration demand or not. and of course, it moved quite a bit higher.
so what i'd really like you to do, one, is kind of take a 30,000-foot viewpoint here. as we all know, price does ultimately ration demand, and the only thing i can see that would maybe do that at this point is maybe global recession or u.s. recession. so can you kind of -- i don't see a lot of demand destruction at this point.
a little bit from bird flu, maybe it's 25 million bushels, which is a spit in the ocean, but do you see any significant demand destruction today -- and including what's happening in ukraine and what they have in storage for corn and other things, what -- how do you look at the world today from a demand -- total demand perspective versus supply? and are we seeing demand destruction with high prices?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, eric. let me see -- let me tell you how i see this. so last year was a big production year, and the world needed to consume more grain than that big production.
so the issue is the world continues to grow, and sometimes, it's not a matter of population growth, but it's a matter of income. and how people, like people in china, has been an incredible economic improvement of their standard of living that improved their diets. that doesn't go down. so we think -- that's why we keep on talking about our trend of food security.
we will have to provide more for the world. in situations like today where we are already tied from a supply demand perspective, and we will get tighter as demand continues to grow, we see here in adm that at least we need two very good seasons of crops in north america and south america to actually balance and become more comfortable in those supply demand imbalances. when we think about prices today, prices today are going up to mark three things that needs to happen. one is export prices need to go up to being able to draw out all the inventories that are stuck there or they are safe, they are hoarded there, to be able to replace the production that we have lost.
the production we have lost in south america, but the production we are losing now in the ukraine and russia. so first, you need to draw out those inventories and bring them into market so we can balance ourselves. the second, as i said before, wheat needs to be placed out of the russians, so you can be preserved for human consumption. and the third one is to give farmers like you the signal that they need to plant more.
and i think the world needs big -- more acres. those acres today, they're not going to happen from the baltic area. they're not going to happen from u.s. that we are basically maxed out, so that may happen in south america.
so we need higher prices to bring south american acres. we need higher prices to draw those inventories into the market, and we need two good years of crops, both in north america and south america. that will allow us to balance the supply and demand, given the strong demand.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. no, and i agree is that we need this year's crop in the u.s., next year's crop in brazil, and we need 2023 in the u.s. to do very well again and maybe even another -- we need four maybe big crops around the world. but sometimes, what rebalances some of this is this high inflation rate that we have around the world.
there's an economic recession that comes in place. have you factored anything into that forecast that would -- would change your outlook?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
eric, i'm not an economist, but i think there is a narrow path to achieve soft landing here. and the u.s. economy has been very resilient through all these events, so i think the u.s. economy is driven by the consumer.
the consumer has been saving money for two years that they didn't spend a lot. and as i said before, they were covid recovery packages, but there has also been salary inflation and wages inflation that has put money in the pockets of customers. so i think that for the foreseeable future, we don't see a significant -- a significant impact of demand. if not, we will be flying that out.
but we look at that, we look at our plans, we are preparing our plans for a long period of strong demand. we want to run them at high capacity. so at this point in time, i don't see -- i don't see an issue in the west. maybe the only flag is how covid lockdowns evolve in china, but that -- i don't have a lot of visibility at this point in time.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. thank you, juan. i appreciate your comments.

good morning, and welcome to the adm first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to introduce your host for today's call, michael cross, director of investor relations. you may begin.
michael cross -- director of investor relations
thank you, emily. good morning, and welcome to adm's first quarter earnings webcast. starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com. please turn to slide 2, the company's safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results.
these statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainty. adm has provided additional information in its reports on file with the sec concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. to the extent permitted under applicable law, adm assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. on today's webcast, our chairman and chief executive officer, juan luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter and highlight some of our accomplishments.
our chief financial officer, vikram luthar, will review the drivers of our performance, as well as corporate results and financial highlights. then juan will make some final comments, and our vice chairman, ray young, will join us for questions. please turn to slide 3. i will now turn the call over to juan. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, michael. this morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.90. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was about $5.3 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 10.6%.
what we saw in the first quarter was an extension and amplification of the factors that supported our growth in 2021. first was our team's great execution. exceptional growth in nutrition and effective risk management exemplified how we continued to serve our customers and provide nutrition around the globe amid volatile market conditions and an inflationary environment. second was an environment of tight supply and demand.
we operated in the first quarter in a constrained supply environment for crops, mostly driven by the smaller south american crop, and for other products driven by some continued supply chain and labor availability issues. and we continued to see solid global demand across most of our products and in most regions. while the pandemic is not over, and we're particularly monitoring the impact of rising cases and lockdowns in china. much of the world continued to emerge.
pent-up demand remained solid, even in the face of higher prices. the great work our team did was in service to our customers, our company, and our purpose. our company has come together once again in the wake of the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of ukraine. adm has about 650 colleagues in ukraine, and of course, our highest priority continues to be supporting and protecting them and their families, as well as helping ukrainian farmers to get as much of their crop production as possible into world markets.
our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of ukraine. slide 4, please. food security is foundational to adm's purpose and beliefs, and recent events have only magnified its importance. from a global pandemic to the short crop in south america to the conflict in ukraine, it has become clear that we cannot take an abundant and efficient supply of food for granted.
even beyond the current dislocations, this issue will remain one of critical importance over the next many years. as the global population grows, the need for nutrition will continue to grow with it. at our global investor day last december, we talked about how we expect demand to push global trade flows of corn, wheat, soybeans, and soybean meal up 21% or 130 million tons in the next 10 years. meeting that demand will not happen automatically.
it will take dedication, expertise, and agility, as well as global scale and capabilities. an example of that is adm's destination marketing network, which gives us a presence in more regions where demand is strong and growing, as well as more direct connections to customers and the ability to offer the full end-to-end capabilities of our integrated value chain. we are seeing how important that is today as customers are coming to us knowing that they can rely on adm to meet their specific needs in a supply constrained environment. we are not immune to the impacts of global disruptions, including those in the black sea region, but our broad portfolio of nutrition products and our ability to efficiently move them around the world will allow us to manage through these dynamic market conditions and continue to help support the food needs of billions of people.
please turn to slide 5. sustainability is another one of the global trends so important to our company's and our planet's future. we remain focused on our strategy, which is aligned with fast-growing demand for an array of products that are environmentally friendly, including alternative projects. that industry continues to show impressive growth.
global sales for alternative meats and dairy products are expected to increase 14% annually, reaching a targeting $125 billion by 2030. when you look at the full range of products that alternative proteins could go into, from meat alternatives and meat extensions to emerging categories like ready meals and specialized nutrition, the opportunities are even greater. our own growth in this area is faster than the industry's. the quality of our product, our integrated end-to-end value chain, our innovative product development, and application capabilities and our global scale make us the partner of choice for our customers.
in fact, we never had a stronger demand for our alternative protein products that we are seeing now, and we are confident in continued growth. that is why earlier this month, we announced a significant investment to nearly double extrusion capacity at our decatur, illinois specialty protein complex. we also announced the industry's first end-to-end alternative protein innovation center. this, of course, follows up our last year's addition of leading european alternative protein provider, soy protein.
alternative proteins are just one of the many areas in which we are expanding our capabilities to meet growing customer demand for more environmentally responsible products. our biosolutions team, for example, continued to expand its pipeline and advance the evolution of our carbohydrate solutions business with an impressive $55 million in revenue growth in the quarter. please turn to slide 6. we are advancing sustainability commitments in other parts of our business as well.
last year, we unveiled new goals to reduce scope 3 emissions and eliminate deforestation from our supply chain. this is critical work. we do not make these kinds of commitments without an achievable plan to meet them, and once we move forward, we constantly challenge ourselves to do it faster. that is why last week, we announced that we've accelerated our deadline for a completely deforestation-free supply chain by five years from 2030 to 2025.
we also recently committed to work with the science-based targets initiative, with the goal of obtaining their approval of adm's climate target and our alignment with ambitious global goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees celsius. across adm, we are continuing to align our portfolio with the world's growing needs and with our own purpose, positioning us to serve our customers, our communities, and our planet and power in our future. i'll discuss our business outlook at the end of our call. but in the meantime, i'd like to turn to vikram to talk about our business.
vikram? 
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
thanks, juan. slide 7, please. the ag services and oilseeds team effectively managed risk and executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment of robust global demand and tight supply, driven primarily by the short south american crop. ag services results were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021.
global trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. north american origination margins and volumes were lower year over year, including approximately $75 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters. crushing was higher year over year in a strong global margin environment driven by robust protein and vegetable oil demand. improving margins in the quarter resulted in approximately $60 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters, versus approximately $50 million in positive timing in the prior-year quarter.
refined products and other results were much higher than the prior-year period, driven by healthy refining premiums and good refined oil demand in north america, as well as strong biodiesel margins in emea. equity earnings from wilmar was significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. looking ahead, we expect substantially higher q2 as&o results than the second quarter of 2021. slide 8, please.
carbohydrate solutions delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. the starches and sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher results versus the prior-year quarter, driven by higher corn core product revenues, improved citric acid profits, and excellent risk management in north america, higher volumes and margins in emea and higher volumes and margins in wheat milling. sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery toward pre-pandemic levels. and as juan mentioned, our biosolutions platform continued to deliver impressive growth, with $55 million in new sales as demand for plant-based products expands into more diverse applications.
vantage corn processors delivered solid execution margins, but position losses on ethanol inventory, as prices fell early in the quarter, drove lower results versus the prior year. the prior-year quarter's results also benefited from demand for usp-grade industrial alcohol from the peoria facility, which was divested in q4 2021. looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the current market dynamics to continue, delivering carbohydrate solutions results similar to the very strong second quarter of 2021. on slide 9, the nutrition business delivered continued strong profit growth.
revenues increased by a very impressive 23%. even when adjusting for currency effects and removing the impacts of recent acquisitions, revenue was up by 17%. and while margins have softened somewhat, they remain healthy. human nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results.
flavors continued to deliver solid revenue growth, offset by some higher costs. strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contributions from our soy protein acquisition and positive currency timing effects in south america, offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in specialty ingredients. health and wellness results were also higher year over year, powered by continued growth in probiotics, including our late 2021 deerland probiotics acquisition and robust demand for fiber. animal nutrition profits were nearly double the year-ago period due primarily to strength in amino acids driven by a combination of product mix changes, improved north american demand, and global supply chain disruptions.
looking ahead, we expect nutrition to deliver a second quarter significantly higher than the prior-year period. and with our recent acquisitions delivering ahead of our expectations, we are raising our profit growth outlook for the full year from 15-plus to 20%. slide 10, please. let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items.
other business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by better performance in captive insurance, including reduced claims settlements versus the prior year. some of the claims settlements that we expected to negatively impact q1 results are now expected in the second quarter. net interest expense for the quarter was higher year over year on higher expense for long-term debt, higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs, and interest related to a tax item. in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $209 million were due primarily to higher it operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence, partially offset by incentive compensation accrual adjustments.
the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. for the full year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate at the higher end of our previously guided range of 16% to 19%. cash flow generation remains strong, $1.6 billion before working capital changes versus $1.2 billion in the prior-year period. our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 34%, and available liquidity of about $9.3 billion, even with almost $3 billion in higher working capital needs since december.
with that, i'll turn it back to juan. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vikram. slide 11, please. as the strong start of the year, we are looking ahead. in the near-term future, we expect lower crop supplies caused by the weak canadian canola crop, the short south american crops, and now the black sea disruptions, to drive continued tightness in global grain markets through 2022, well into 2023, and perhaps beyond.
as we look further ahead, markets will continue to reflect the importance of the enduring global trends that are fueling performance across our portfolio including a growing global population, driving expansion in demand for full and healthy nutrition. that is why the work we've done to build a better adm is so important. we have the global integrated network, risk management capabilities, and diverse product portfolio to help us navigate through tight market conditions and meet global nutritional needs. this is the challenge we expanded, improved, and repositioned our business to meet, and we'll continue to advance our strategy and grow our capabilities through our productivity and innovation initiatives in order to drive performance under our control and deliver on the evolving needs of our customers.
but it doesn't stop with adm. our working with other participants across the food and agriculture value chain, from farmers who continue to do more every year to sustainably increase production to technology providers who offer new ways to make more with less, to governments who, in a tight supply and demand environment, should resist the impulse to impose export restrictions. so looking at the balance of the year, when we combine the strategic work we have done to align our portfolio with fundamental global trends with our strong execution and the expectation of a continued tight supply demand environment, we expect 2022 results to substantially exceed 2021's. and as we look further ahead to a future of increasing needs for more and better foods, we will continue to work to add new adjacent products to address the world's toughest challenges and unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.
once again, i'd like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their commitment and hard work to serve vital global needs in a challenging and dynamic environment. with that, emily, please open the line for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question for today comes from ben bienvenu from stephens. ben, your line is now open
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey. thank you. good morning, everybody.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i want to ask one kind of bigger-picture conceptual question, and then my second question is more near term in nature. the first is on the accelerated share repurchase. i'd be curious to hear a little bit more about all of the decision points that flow into that bigger-picture decision. i would imagine -- you highlighted strong underlying fundamentals in the business.
i imagine there's a component associated with working capital as well as some of that frees up with commodity markets cooling a bit. i'm curious also to get an update on your longer-term capacity expansion pipeline and how on schedule those build-outs are. and should we think of share repurchase as a lever to throttle up and pull back depending on m&a and capex timing of kind of long-lived capital investments? that's my first question.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ben. good question. we are maintaining our balanced capital allocation that we put together some years back.
we always said that we're going to take about 30% to 40% of our free cash flow to reinvest in the business, and that's what our strategy of bolt-on and organic growth normally takes. and that will be the priority. we have exciting opportunities ahead of us. so we're going to prioritize our investment plan.
but of course, we've been paying dividends for 90 years. we've been growing dividends for more than 40 years, and we will continue that. we increased dividends 8% this year. and when we're looking at our distribution, again, this 60% to 70%, whether there are strategic opportunities to do m&a or giving back to shareholders, as we said before, at this point in time, when valuations may be correcting and all that, we don't have any significant targets in front of us.
our team continues to look for bolt-ons. and given the significant strength of our cash flows, we have decided to honor that return of shareholder -- of funds to shareholders. so i would say we will maintain that balanced allocation. we are not -- in the plan when we presented in december, we were looking at the later part of the plan as we were approaching $6 to $7 per share that we will have ability to repurchase about $5 billion of that.
certainly, we will be, as i said in my initial remarks, north of $6.50 today. so some of those buybacks are accelerated to the scenario. so i would say it continues to be consistent in that regard. is there a later part of the question i'm missing or forgetting? the capacity to increase, yes, organic capacity.
listen, we are -- as you can -- vikram mentioned it, we are increasing our capex into $1.3 billion. and we've been accelerating some long lead equipment this year to make sure that our capacity expansions remain on schedule. so if we look at the big ones that we have right now, whether it's spiritwood, which is still expected to be online by the harvest of 2023. we are expanding capacity in bioactives in valencia.
that's expected to come in the first quarter of 2023. that's also on schedule. so i would say, in general, across the globe, since we have the ability and the funds, we've been making sure that we eliminated that risk or we minimized that risk. of course, there is always a risk of labor, and labor is tight, especially in north america.
but i think at this point in time, we don't have any major deviation to our plans.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. great. my second question is related to the grappling of supply demand that we're seeing right now. obviously, there, you highlighted your expectation of structurally higher margins across your business.
that makes sense given the kind of bigger-picture structural changes in demand that support the profitability of your business over the next several years. but we are starting to see demand destruction cyclically as the consumer deteriorates. i think your business is really well-positioned. but i'm curious about kind of what you guys are keeping your eyes on relative to a deteriorating underlying consumer and that -- the consequence of that rippling back up the supply chain -- the value chain potentially.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. ben, listen, we're watching the demand, of course. we go -- we work very closely with our customers and our farmers on this. i would say we have seen demand substitution, demand shifting here or there.
and you see it in retail, maybe to private label. we've seen a little bit to people looking into smaller packaging to make things more affordable. so i would say if i think of the big categories for adm, food tends to be, despite all these comments, much more reliable, much more stable in that -- just the essential nature of that. i think our fuels business, our biofuels business in general, are more tied to programs that are long term and to initiatives to reduce emissions and improve climate over the long term.
so they also tend to be relatively firm, if you will. and we see that with rgd bringing new demand for oil. so if we have any issue in edible oils, it's certainly been more than offset by the new demand on renewables. and i will say the area where maybe we keep a closer look to all that is animal feed.
animal feed has been impacted by this. we estimate something in the range of maybe 10 million to 15 million tons on a global basis that maybe we took out of our smbs from the globe perspective, not just from our own revenue, from the globe smbs. i think we have seen less of an impact on an op perspective because as people like to trade down, if you will, or if they were to trade down from beef, chicken is a cheaper protein. it's a more affordable protein.
and chicken is where we get all the soybean meal mostly sourced. if you think about what's happening with soybean meal, it is -- it has a cost advantage to corn. so it continues to have a high proportion in the russians on things that are, if you will, more demanded right now like poultry. when we go to nutrition, i think you said it in your -- in the question is we are well-positioned in some of the applications that are growing the fastest.
and of course, not completely insulated. to a certain degree, we haven't seen significant drops at this point in time. so our expansions and -- continue forward. and you saw in our remarks, our -- the acquisitions we made last year are actually performing from an op perspective better than in the economic model we put together.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. thanks for the detailed answer. congratulations on the results.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ben theurer from barclays. ben, your line is now open.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
thank you so much and good morning, juan and vikram.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
so my first question is also related a little bit to the picture you draw and you laid out just about seven, eight months ago during the capital markets day back in december, and you talked about the path to get to the $6 to $7. now you're just at $6.50 for this year. but the one thing that kind of pops out is the significant strength and the up we've been seeing on the return on invested capital. and you still say your long-term objective is 10%, but now we've been consistently gone higher.
so if we put it like into the context and your comments of the margin structure to remain higher, how should we think conceptually over the medium to long term? where is your real roic objective given that you've been consistently above that 10% level? and what does that mean for your potential to return cash to shareholders via dividends, buybacks versus then, ultimately, the capex needs?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
thanks, ben, for the question. so just to give you some context, when we decided on the 10% roic target, it was based on an expectation of about 300 basis points above our long-term cost of capital. the long-term cost of capital has been around 7% for some time now. but as we look forward and we see interest rates on the rise, there is likelihood that over the medium term, the long-term wacc is going to increase.
we still want to maintain our buffer or our spread versus that long-term wacc. so in short, yes, we are actually looking at growing our roic beyond the 10%. we haven't firmly established a new target. but clearly, as you've seen, we are well ahead of 10% on the back of a strong demand outlook for the medium term as well a strong discipline on the denominator from a balance sheet perspective.
so in terms of the capital allocation and the forward outlook, ben, i think it's consistent with what juan said. we expect we are going to be very disciplined and balanced in terms of how we deploy that capital, both in terms of reinvesting in the business. and by the way, the opportunities to reinvest in the business are significant. juan mentioned some, including the operational transformation.
and much of that is not even baked into the medium-term plan that we highlighted. so we anticipate there likely will be some additional reinvestment in the business, but that should still leave us enough flexibility to do share buyback, potentially even in excess of $5 billion as well as continue our pace of dividend growth as we've done historically over the last 40-plus years.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that sounds very promising, vikram. thank you very much for that. and then just coming back on the growth and what's being delivered within the nutrition segment, just to kind of frame it and understand it well what you're seeing into the back half here because clearly, you kind of reconfirmed the 20-ish percent growth in op income.
we've had a very strong first half. you expect next quarter to be better. is there anything where you think there could be a little bit of a headwind in the more short term just because of people maybe down-trading on the consumption side? you mentioned a little bit maybe the packaging side going to smaller sizes, etc., but to understand a little bit the risks versus the opportunities within nutrition.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. ben, first of all, nutrition is the business where we're probably exposed the most to the supply chain issues that everybody is talking about because we have more variety of raw materials that we consume in all these formulations. so that is always something that the team works very well to overcome. but that's an issue we watch very closely.
the second is, as you know, that business is also very strong in europe, so there is a forex exposure that we keep on looking. and i mentioned at the beginning that animal nutrition volumes are a little bit more difficult, i think that given the price point where we are. so i would say those are the three levers that we keep on looking to make sure that we balance that. i would have to say the business has done a terrific job of offsetting all that.
and again, we still believe in our enhanced guidance from 15% to 20% for this year. we're still going to do that. and the business, again, as i've said many, many times before, it's clearly in its path to achieve our $1 billion operating profit objective probably next year. so we feel good about the business, but it's not without a lot of active management, if you will.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you very much.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ben.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam samuelson from goldman sachs. adam, your line is now open.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
morning. juan, so i wanted to maybe dig into the outlook on oilseeds a little bit. in your prepared remarks, you alluded to a mid-cycle or normalized medium-term kind of margin structure that moves higher, and i'd love to get a little bit more color on how your view over the medium term has evolved there and especially in the context of a north american kind of industry that's in the midst of some pretty healthy capacity expansions by you and many others.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. adam, listen, we continue to see a strong demand for meal and oil. north america has many advantages. north america has the beans and north america has a robust domestic consumption.
north america has the new demand for oil. so that makes, of course, soybean meal more competitive in the world. we continue to see good margins and good volumes in poultry as -- again, as the consumer favors that meat. we continue to see soybean meal advantage to corn.
as i said before, in the russian, that continues to have high inclusion rates. we see china recovering from covid, so activity coming back. and we see argentina pretty much given the current financial issues outside of the markets in terms of their aggressiveness. so i would say the scenario that we've been seeing, it continues with strength going forward.
i think that's kind of what we see at the moment. so q3 is strong. i would say maybe if i go to canola, canola has been -- margins have popped. so maybe we had -- we didn't have that in the past.
now we have, they're very strong. so we see a strong demand for biodiesel. i'm just trying to go mentally through all the businesses. and as we said before, wilmar has been doing very good.
so we don't see any significant clouds in the horizon right now. we have good expectations. we think that for the second half, the u.s. will become the place to export for corn and soybeans.
so i think that exports should come to the u.s. from the period of september to maybe february or maybe even march. so we will have to watch logistics and whether logistics can allow us to execute a strong export season. but that's probably the only thing out there that i will be thinking, adam, in terms of puts and takes.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's all really helpful. and if i could maybe just switch gears over to carbohydrate solutions and specifically starches and sweeteners. i mean very strong kind of first half results.
and i guess i'm trying to think about the contributions of between kind of volume growth, better ethanol profitability, coproducts and kind of -- and risk management and just that thing could be your most mature business, and seeing some very, very healthy absolute and year-over-year performance and trying to just maybe just aggregate some of the drivers there a little bit.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so adam, just breaking it down into volume margin and mix. in sweeteners and starches, from a volume perspective, actually, we saw volumes in north america higher year over year in the first half.
and that is different from what you may have heard generally in the marketplace. we clearly benefit from an integrated network that enables us to deliver to our customers effectively and efficiently. and in some cases, we've actually also imported tapioca starch, for example, from europe to meet that demand. so volume has been strong.
in terms of margin, clearly, we benefited from higher coproduct values, including corn oil in particular. so that's also helped in terms of the net corn and effective margins for sweeteners and starches. and from a mix perspective, we talked about biosolutions driving more and more growth, higher than what we had anticipated. so on all three fronts, in terms of volume, margin, and mix, s&s looks brighter than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.
in terms of ethanol also, if you think about similar way of thinking about volumes, volumes have been strong in terms of gasoline demand locally. strong exports expected. we've had strong exports. outlook for exports about 1.6 billion gallons for the year.
in terms of margins, we've also again benefited from the fact that we've had good coproduct values particularly, again, in dco. and that has helped us maintain margins. the other aspect is the -- our views have been finalized. so that puts -- removes the cloud from the regulatory landscape, at least for 2022.
and gasoline and ethanol blending economics remain fantastic. if you include rin values, that's above $2 relative to rbob today. so i think based on all those facts, we think q3 is going to be stronger quarter over quarter. and our outlook for the year is also very constructive.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
just to clarify, vikram, because i don't think that was the nuance you said in the prepared remarks. you said -- in the prepared remarks you said significantly higher year over year and you're saying all of carbohydrate solutions will be higher quarter over quarter as well. i just want to be clear on that point.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
no. my comments were specifically quarter over quarter, significantly higher quarter over quarter for q3. and what i just emphasized as well, we are constructive for the outlook for the full year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. that's super helpful. thank you.
i'll bet it's not.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ken zaslow from bank of montreal. ken, your line is now open.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just a couple of questions. one is, how much dollar amount do you expect to increase in 2023 from your cost savings and your harvesting of your growth investments? how do we kind of think about that for 2023 in terms of the dollar amounts that's going to be coming out from both your cost savings and your investments in growth?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
so i think, ken, just providing context, going back to the global investor day in terms of the framework, right, we talked about productivity and innovation driving about $1.1 billion in aggregate each. and then we expected market forces should be about $1 billion. in terms of 2023, we haven't gone through the specific plan yet, right? we are still working through that. but you could assume kind of a flat line, roughly speaking, over that four-year time frame.
what i would submit to you, ken, is over the last three or four months, as juan mentioned, we see additional opportunities on the horizon as it relates to operational transformation with digitization and automation. we talked about the marshall example. if we multiply that marshall example, the upside could be even more. but that's something that we are still fleshing out, and we will be prepared in the foreseen quarters to provide you a little more granularity on that.
juan?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. ken, what i would like to add to what vikram said is that if i think back to december, there are two things that are different. a lot of the productivity efforts this year have been used to offset inflation, and i think the team has done a terrific job of protecting margins in that sense. those productivity efforts continue.
and as inflation may be recedes next year, we might see that -- more of that coming to actually improve our productivity versus just offsetting inflation. the second thing that i noticed and i tried to make a point in my prepared remarks is that we probably see innovation -- a little bit more activity in innovation. i think that as customers are trying to fight inflation, i think that bringing a newness, bringing new categories, new innovation, we've seen that in nutrition and other pieces of the portfolio. so i think there is an opportunity there.
and some of the things that were not included in our five-year estimate, whether it was some of the growth on health & wellness or some of the biosolutions opportunities and all that, are coming stronger and faster than maybe we anticipated. so vikram said it, we normally start the planning season maybe late september or october. so we're going to be looking at '23 there. but i think we're going to have a lot of puts and takes on a scenario that is very dynamic.
but we feel good about the initiatives we can control, let's say.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. just a clarification question. you talked about the $6.50 number. that includes share repurchases.
is that -- does that -- but yes, underlying fundamentals seem stronger than maybe you expected. can you reconcile that? because if it includes the share repurchase, i would argue that maybe it should better than that. i don't know if you're being conservative. i'm not trying to pinpoint you.
just -- there was just some incongruence in terms of the accelerated share repurchase and just kind of sticking to that $6.50 number. i just wanted to touch base with that -- touch base on that, if you could help us out on that.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so ken, just to be clear, we did not say an asr. we did not say accelerated share repurchase, right? i want to make sure that we clarify that comment. we did say that we are going to do $1 billion in the back half of the year.
and as you well know is eps impact of that, given the averaging, is pretty minimized for this calendar year. so the impact, whether you consider a share repurchase in the $6.50 number or not is frankly insignificant for 2022.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. so just putting this all together, even as fundamentals kind of stabilize at this higher level, your share repurchases, your productivity, and your growth initiatives can propel earnings higher in 2023 even if fundamentals kind of stabilize and not -- not to say we're peaking, i don't want to use that word, but if we stabilize at a higher level. is that fair way to think about it, that your interactions, those three components, can drive earnings growth in 2023? and i'll leave it there. i appreciate your time.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
ken, the way i think about it, let me share that, is we need to have in adm certain ambidexterity. on one side, we have a team that executes on opportunities presented by the market. and the team is executing on great opportunities this year. we don't control that all the time.
we control our execution, but we don't control the opportunities that pop based on the macro environment. on the other hand, we are committed to keep improving the company. so -- and that's what we committed in december over the five-year plan. so to the extent that those forces, whether favorable or negative, offset our productivity and innovation, at times, we're going to see more of that effect and at times, we're going to see less.
so we know we're going to grow earnings over the next five years based on all that. we have not gotten to 2023 at this point in time. so i want to make sure that people don't hear that what we're going to do is a promise to grow earnings every year. we cannot control all the environment in the world, but we can control that we get better and we can control that we can maximize our execution on the opportunities provided.
will 2023 provide the same opportunities of 2022? unclear at this point in time, and we need to go through our scenarios. but i think we're going to feel -- we feel very good, as i said, on the team's ability to execute. some of the macro that we're seeing in terms of demand, demand for food has been growing over the last 15 years at 1.8% per year. you can argue that at times, we are getting to the peak of arable land being brought into production, that at times, we are hitting the peak of maybe even yield in the area.
so we think that although margins may not stay at this level, if they're going to stabilize, they're going to stabilize at higher level than in the past. and that's where we based our forecast in december, and we are maintaining that. so we feel good about continue to grow earnings. we haven't gotten to the specific 2023 number yet.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate it. thank you, guys.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ken.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve byrne of bank of america. steve, your line is now open.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you. vikram, you had some constructive comments about third quarter for ag solutions and oilseeds and i wanted to specifically ask you about which of those two big businesses is primarily driving that favorable outlook? and in ag services, what is it? what regions of the world? where do you see that strength coming from? and then one more for you on that. and if there is less crop production in the world in 2022 just from significantly less fertilizer applications, is that net positive or net negative for you? you could have tighter supplies but less volume.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so thanks for the question, steve. in terms of as&o -- i'll break it up. in terms of as, we talked about destination marketing being very strong, right? so that's part of global trading.
we anticipate that to remain strong given our ability to deliver to customers around the globe. and actually, we have -- the globally integrated network we have enables us to do that very effectively and efficiently. so we believe that's going to be a continued contributor of the growth. you think about also where we are positioned as a company in north america and south america.
where is the world likely going to come for grain in the back half of this year? it's probably going to be in north america. and with a reasonable crop that we expect right now, we should be well-positioned to be able to benefit from that, given our footprint. so i think the strength in destination marketing within global trade as well as our asset footprint and the dearth of grain around the globe in light of what's happened gives us good flexibility and constructive margin outlook for the back half. on the oilseeds side, the fundamentals remain strong.
i mean you've seen that the demand for oil both on the food side as well as rgd remains strong. so north american crush margins should be constructive. as soybean meal remains a very efficient and cost-effective protein substitute for even wheat as wheat prices, even though they've come up, they're still relatively expensive. so soybean meal remains an important feed for all types of protein and especially for poultry, and you've seen the number of poultry rising.
so we're constructive for crush margins in north america. and even with biodiesel as well, that's also providing another avenue to support crush margins even in europe. so crush margin outlook for the back half is strong in terms of the fundamentals that i highlighted. so candidly, the strength in as&o is both on as as well as o for the back half of this year.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and you made a comment on one of the slides about investing in this sustainable agriculture initiative of fbn. my question for you on that is, how meaningful of an opportunity do you think this is for you? are your food company customers willing to pay a premium to you, and thus the farmer, for grains and oilseeds that are produced in various sustainable ways? is this a niche? or is this a potentially meaningful portion of your origination business?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. steve, this is juan. we are building this. i think we have a division now within the business to look at these certified grains, if you will, or differentiated grains.
there is certainly a consumer push into this that we feel through the cpgs and having the desire to engage in these transactions with us. so it continues to build. i don't think it's going to be meaningful to our earnings over the next two, three years, but it's something that is aligned with sustainability trends. it's aligned with the ability of the whole industry to decarbonize and become better.
so it makes us more sustainable. but it is growing. it's still small, but it continues to accelerate. so i don't think you should expect an op impact over the next two years, but we're building a good position here.
and with partners like fbn and all that, we continue to improve the economics and simplify the recognition to farmers as they embrace sustainable practices. so there is an economic motive or result later on, maybe in the planning cycle. at this point in time, it's more a sustainability thing that we do to help our customers as they need more of this.
steve byrne -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tom palmer of j.p. morgan. tom, your line is now open.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. thank you for the questions. maybe i'll just start off on the crushing side. margin info in the earnings presentation was encouraging as was your second half commentary.
at the same time, we saw board crush at least temporarily weaken going back a month or two. so it looks like it hasn't carried forward in terms of board crush or in spot as much but -- and nor have much bearing on third quarter results, but i hope to get at least a little bit of color on what happened and why the impact was so temporary.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, tom, what we saw -- of course, base has became a little bit tighter in the u.s. and soy, and we saw a little bit of palm oil correction that may be impacted some of the oil. so you get board compressed a little bit.
in reality, the cash markets have never moved, and they remain very constructive and very strong. and now you have seen how board crush have bounced back. i think that what we need to remember is like before all this volatility, whether it's the war or this or that, we were coming into very strong markets. again, demand continues to grow for meal.
and now we have another leg of that, that has a new demand. and mature markets like these, when they get new demand in a significant quantity like rgd, you get a significant change in margin. when you think about the structural changes that have happened over time, whether it's the different way with china feed porks now or argentina with an exchange rate delta that makes the farmer really have no desire to sell and the farmer, to a certain degree, curtailing crush in argentina. and then we see china coming back from the lockdowns and soybean meal being better than corn into the russian, we continue to see this strong.
now we have also canola helping onto this on the strength in biofuels, in biodiesel per se. so i think from our perspective, we were always looking at cash margins. and so we -- it didn't make a significant shift in our operating profit as we were saying in the last earnings calls, to be honest. so it has moved and at times some of these moves, to be honest, in commodities has been driven more by financial flows than fundamentals.
i would say the fundamentals were strong before the war. they continue to be strong. some prices have spiked because of the war, then they came back, but they came back to the high levels that we had before the war because it was just supply demand fundamentals. and as much as people talk about rising interest rates and all that, rising interest rates do not produce grain.
so we have not seen any change in our supply demand fundamentals that were in place before the war, before the tightening by the fed. so to a certain degree, we need to keep our eyes on the fundamentals. that's what matters.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. thank you. that's very helpful color. maybe i'll just follow up on the soybean oil side.
there's a lot of renewable diesel capacity scheduled to come online later this year. what are you seeing in terms of that demand environment? are you starting to see inventories build to essentially new customers? because the soybean curve at least is downward sloping and it does seem like there's a lot more demand to step up that could at least theoretically change that.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, i think we're building new industries. so there are so many players here and so many things in motion. it's a very dynamic environment that we continue to watch.
i think with -- we see the demand coming as expected. i think you may have, like in every capital project these days, some projects that may be a little bit delayed. but we don't see any significant change to our medium-term forecast. so we see the strength.
we see the recovery on even potentially edible oils based on china coming back into the markets and coming back from lockdowns. so none of our forecast has changed in the oil side. and if you look at the contribution of meal and oil to crush from the last quarter to this quarter, it has maintained. so it looks like both legs continue to have the same strength at this point than we expected.
tom palmer -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tom.

thank you. our next question comes from eric larson of seaport research partners. eric, your line is now open.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a great quarter. so this may sound kind of like a little bit of a corny question, juan, and is very 30,000-foot kind of speaking level. in the past, there's no promise that aren't long enough.
when you have global recession, it does change the fundamentals for grain demand. and i get the question all the time. my sense is so that there are enough structural changes, particularly in the u.s. market, where even if we did have a global recession is that the fundamentals have a reasonable chance of remaining fairly strong.
is that an off-base thought? or how would you look at that?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. as i was saying in the previous question, i think that, again, before rising rates that could drive into a slowdown of the economy or the war, we had a tight balance sheet. i mean, eric, and you want to keep it at 30,000 feet. we're going to run this experiment of trying to feed two more billion people from here to 2050, something that we haven't done in the past.
and as i said, you could argue that if we're going to move population from 7 billion to like 9.5 billion by 2050, there's not the same proportion of arable land are going to be brought into production nor the same proportion of yield going to be. so i think in recessions, food is more protected than other things. so we don't expect a significant drop in demand, at least not for a sustainable period of time. while the reality is that production may or may not be there when you think about weather, when you think about the limitations of acreage or the limitations of potential yield.
so our scenario is for tightness going forward. and we will do our best to make sure we continue to supply the billions of people around the world with their needs. but i think it's more prudent to plan on a tight supply demand scenario. and at this point in time, when we run the supply demand going a little bit more shorter term, we think that at least we need to have two very good years of good crops in north america and south america to bring a little bit more of relief to the current supply demand inventories.
even if we have a good growth in north america, i don't think we're going to increase pipeline from -- for soybeans at this point in time. and south america has been with la niña for like three years or something like that. so some of these events are starting to last a little bit longer. thankfully, in north america, everything looks like we're still going to have another good year.
so we welcome the end of the harvest to see a very good crop this year in north america.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. no, i would agree with that. so i'll ask one more quick question, and it's more technical in nature. so in the quarter, you put over $3 billion on top of your inventories.
and i'm just curious when you look at where grain prices were on march 31st versus june 30th, june 30th, you were down across the board, corn, beans, meal, oil, wheat, all the prices were down. so does that mean that you've just taken on -- you've been able to buy more grain, taken on bigger positions so your volume inventory is larger? does that explain that $3 billion-plus of inventory increase?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
well, i think the inventory, when you're talking about us, i think our working capital effectively from q1 to q2 has come down a bit, eric. so i think it's a function of both volumes as well as prices. yes, prices have come off. but i think it's a function of also what's happening around the globe.
you've got to think about not just our ag services and oilseeds business, you got to think about also the other parts of our business. so while in general, there is a correlation to prices, there's also not necessarily same flat volume across every quarter.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you. [inaudible]
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steven haynes of morgan stanley. steven, your line is now open.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
everyone, thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. i just wanted to ask a question on china. it's come up a few times. maybe could you just go into a little bit more detail around demand dynamics there? i think soybean imports are still kind of trending down year over year.
so are we kind of at an inflection point there? and any additional color would be great. thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we think -- we are in close contact with our china team, of course. and i think demand there has, of course, suffered an impact. you saw their quarterly growth rate for the whole country.
but we get encouraging reports of how activity is coming back. i think that at the beginning, even if they relieved on some of the restrictions, people were still a little bit shy to come out. but i think that now we're seeing people coming back to the office, were 100% back into the office. that brings traffic and that brings external breakfast and external lunches and things like that.
so we see that with a recovery, if you will, coming from our perspective. if you think about the four main meats for china, china has produced about 5% more of the combined four meats in the first half of the year. so you could see there that, of course, the mouths are still there to be fed. and certainly, food security continues to be a high priority of, of course, the very responsible chinese government.
so nothing significant to report other than the ease of the covid situation that is happening in multiple cities.
steven haynes -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robert moskow of credit suisse. robert, your line is now open.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, juan and vikram. juan, forgive me if you've addressed this already, but there's a lot of grain still trapped in ukraine. and i want to know if you have a view on what's going to happen to it and how it will affect your business.
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so thank you for the question on ukraine. so our priorities in the company, rob, as we have said it before, continue to be twofold. first is to provide for the support and well-being of our employees now and into the future.
but the second very close priority is what you described, is that how do we help the industry in ukraine, the agricultural industry to come back on their feet. as you know, there are 20 million, 30 million tons trapped there. and we've been working to increase the land exports and i think even some of the river exports. and so we're very proud of what the whole industry has done to increase those.
we're still short of that. and of course, that's why you see both countries signing this black sea initiative, which is to allow odessa and other ports there to come back to full capacity to be able to export. at this point in time, as you have read the news, you get encouraging news one day and maybe discouraging news the other day. i do believe that both countries are committed to help keep this corridor open.
i think that at the beginning, you're going to see a little bit of a trickle down of exports, maybe smaller boats. i think it's going to take a little bit of building confidence that this works before you can put the bigger boats. there are issues in the country about getting fuel for that. there are issues in the country about getting the crews to man this boat.
there are also issues about insurance and financial institutions guaranteeing some of these large transactions. so i think i'm optimistic. i think you're going to have a trickle-down. that will be good for all -- for us and for everybody that we allow that capacity not to be unutilized, if you will.
at this point in time, the world needs access to those inventories. so this is an important thing. if we don't have access to those inventories and they are not clear from the storage next year, we may have an availability issue for food because we will lose part of the crop. ukrainians apparently have done a very good job of planting about 70% of all the capacity -- all the area, and they are harvesting right now the wheat.
they're going to be harvesting in september and october, the corn and the sunseed. so we need that space to be able to store those in september and october. so we are optimistic. we are helping as much as possible.
there is a lot of people with good intention. so hopefully, we will see the sea exports to grow over the next two or three months.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our final question for today comes from michael piken of cleveland research. michael, your line is now open.
michael piken -- cleveland research company -- analyst
yeah. good morning. thanks for the question. a couple of parts on nutrition.
the first part being within human nutrition, how much of your revenue growth was with new customers versus expansion of current customers? and then on the animal nutrition side, how much of the growth was due to the favorability of the lysine market versus just internal operational improvements? and how sustainable is that? thanks.
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
on the human nutrition side, it was a balanced growth across new customers as well as existing customers. and we think about our revenue growth in terms of volume, pricing and mix, right? so i think we had balanced growth across the three. we drove early action on pricing to ensure that we maintain margins and kept a strong focus on driving mix. price elasticity for some of the products -- or most of the products, frankly, we participate in human nutrition has tended to be pretty low as juan noted.
so i think that's helped benefit protecting margins as well as driving revenue growth. on the animal nutrition side, as i highlighted in my prepared comments, most of that growth has come from amino acids, and amino acids has benefited from, a, the relative protein demand as well as supply chain challenges out of china. and the third aspect that's benefited us is our conscious effort to switch from liquid lysine to dry lysine. and that's -- sorry, so from dry lysine to liquid lysine, yes.
and that's actually helped us drive improved profitability and improved margins as well as increase stickiness with our customers. so most of that volume growth in animal nutrition has been driven by amino acids.
operator
we have no further questions for today, so i will hand back to michael cross for any further remarks.

our chief financial officer, vikram luthar, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights. then juan will make some final comments, and he and vikram will take your questions. please turn to slide 3. i will now turn the call over to juan. 
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, michael. this morning, we reported outstanding second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.15. adjusted segment operating profit was $1.8 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda approached $6 billion. and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted roic was 11.6%.
our team executed extremely well in the second quarter, navigating dynamic conditions to deliver nutritions to billions. and even as we work tirelessly to serve our customers and consumers around the globe, we are continuing to advance our strategy with productivity initiatives that are improving our efficiency and cost structure and innovation works that is powering profitable growth. slide 4, please. productivity is how we are improving our execution and optimizing costs is key to our long-term success, but equally as importantly, our productivity work is helping us mitigate the impact of inflation.
we have a very strong pipeline of productivity initiatives, and i will be updating you on them regularly. there are two initiatives i'd like to highlight today. first is a set of operational transformation efforts we are driving across production facilities around the globe and spanning all three businesses. earlier this year, we completed a modernization project in our marshall, minnesota corn facility that is unlocking significant new value through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics.
we're already seeing double-digit returns on the investment we made in that project. this is an example of the kinds of projects we're undertaking across our operational footprint, designed to unlock incremental volumes and deliver safer, more reliable, more cost-efficient operations. second, as we look to continue to grow returns, we want to focus not only on the numerator but also the denominator. our original $1 billion challenge and its follow-up, the next billion, help us drive to 10% roic.
earlier this year, we launched a new challenge aimed at monetizing assets and optimizing working capital to unlock another $1 billion in cash, helping us to continue to drive returns. in fact, we already realized more than $400 million. next slide, please. we're also advancing our innovation pillar, fueling profitable growth as we continue to expand our capabilities to meet demand across the three global trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability.
for example, last november, we added significant new capabilities in our health & wellness business with the acquisition of deerland probiotics. demand in the human microbiome space is expected to reach $9.1 billion by 2026. while in animal feed, probiotic demand is expected to grow to $6.2 billion. deerland, with a broad portfolio of probiotics, prebiotics and enzymes provides a wide array of commercial, r&d, and operations-related synergy opportunities to help us meet that demand.
and we're taking advantage of those opportunities, from connecting our deal and capabilities with our biopolis team in spain to utilize spore probiotics in a functional chocolate bar, to bringing together our expertise to expand our capabilities in pet, a key growth category, to looking across teams to offer new types of dietary supplements. thanks to the strong collaboration across the enterprise, deerland today is increasing our share of wallet for customers in both human and pet solutions. and we're seeing similar outcomes from other recent investments as well. in the first half of the year, our combined portfolio of 2021 nutrition acquisitions has delivered significantly more op than we had in our acquisition models.
now i'd like to turn the call over to vikram to talk about our business performance. vikram?
vikram luthar -- chief financial officer
thanks, juan. slide 6, please. the ag services and oilseeds team delivered exceptional results in a dynamic market. ag services results more than doubled versus the year-ago quarter.
global trade had an outstanding quarter. the destination marketing team's ability to meet customer demand around the globe helped drive strong volumes and margins. and good execution in global freight, as well as net timing gains of about $65 million for the quarter, contributed to significantly higher year-over-year profits. north america had a solid performance as export volumes remained strong in a good global demand environment, though year-over-year results were lower due to the prior year's insurance settlement and strong positioning gains.
south america results were higher based on stronger origination volumes and better margins driven by strong global grain demand. crushing delivered substantially higher results. strong soy crush margins drove improved performance in all three regions as meal and oil demand remained robust. positive net timing effects of approximately $90 million for the quarter versus the $70 million of negative timing in the year-ago period helped drive year-over-year results.
refined products and other results were similar to the prior year period as strong demand for biofuels and food oils drove refining premiums and biodiesel margins, offset by approximately $150 million of negative timing effects versus negative $30 million in the prior year quarter. equity earnings from wilmar were significantly higher versus the second quarter of 2021. looking ahead for as&o. we expect q3, the seasonal transition quarter from the south american to the north american harvest, to deliver results significantly higher than the prior-year period driven by continued strong global demand for grains and strong cash -- crush margins.
slide 7, please. the carbohydrate solutions team delivered a second quarter of extremely strong results. the starches and sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much better results due to solid demand as food service volumes reached close to pre-pandemic levels. corn coproducts, including strong demand for corn oil and effective risk management, drove higher ethanol and sweetener margins.
biosolutions continued its strong growth with $81 million in year-over-year revenue growth in q2 and $136 million year to date. vantage corn processors results was slightly higher in an environment of good gasoline demand and strong ethanol blending economics. a $50 million recovery from the usda biofuel producer recovery program helped offset the prior year's strong industrial alcohol results from the now sold peoria facility as well as valuation losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell late in the quarter. looking ahead to the third quarter.
we expect results significantly higher versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by steady demand for our products and favorable ethanol blending economics. on slide 8, the nutrition business continued on its strong growth trajectory with 19% year-over-year profit growth. revenues increased by 20% on a constant currency basis and 13% like-for-like, and the team did a good job protecting margins. human nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results.
flavors grew revenue in north america, emea, and south america, though profits were lower due to negative currency effects in emea as well as weaker results in apac. healthy demand for alternative proteins resulted in strong soy protein volumes and margins as contributions from the sojaprotein acquisition as well as good demand for texturants drove higher results in specialty ingredients. strength across probiotics, including in the recently acquired deerland business as well as robust demand for fibers, contributed to a stronger quarter in health & wellness. across the human nutrition business, we continue to see low price elasticity and good demand for our diverse portfolio of ingredients and systems as we continue to support our customers with new product and cost-out innovation and drive industry-leading win rates.
animal nutrition profits were up substantially year over year driven by continued strong volumes and margins in amino acids. looking ahead, we expect third quarter results for nutrition to be higher year over year as the business remains on a trajectory to deliver 20% op growth for the full year. slide 9, please. other business results increased from the prior-year quarter driven primarily by higher adm investor services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates.
in the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $267 million was slightly higher year over year due primarily to higher it operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence. net interest expense for the quarter increased year over year on higher rates and higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs as well as higher expense for long-term debt. the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 18%. based upon our current outlook, we expect full year corporate costs to trend toward $1.3 billion versus our previous outlook of about $1.2 billion, largely due to higher year-over-year interest rates.
we still expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. next slide, please. year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $3.2 billion are up significantly versus $2.2 billion at the same time last year. our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 30% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion.
driven by our strong cash flows and robust earnings, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase program, adding to the $200 million we repurchased in the second quarter of the year with an additional $1 billion in the back half. and of course, the strong cash flows and balance sheet also preserve our flexibility to continue reinvesting in the business and advancing upside growth opportunities. our capex outlook is unchanged at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. juan?
juan luciano -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vikram. slide 11, please. for context, as we discuss our outlook, i would like to go back to the goals and drivers we laid out at our global investor day in december. we talked about the plan in which our strategic productivity and innovation actions will continue to build a better adm and align our portfolio to meet accelerating structural demand changes driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability and how that would drive a strong earnings trajectory over the plan horizon.
what has transpired since then is that some of the market factors have reinforced and further enhanced the value proposition of our diverse product portfolio and our integrated global network of assets. this helps drive stronger-than-expected margins. so while we may see some reversion in the medium term, we now believe that margin structures are generally higher than when we have laid out in december. we are on a trajectory to deliver a very strong second half, resulting in expected full year earnings above $6.50 per share.
and as vikram said, the strong cash flows we are generating will enable us to accelerate the timing of our share repurchase program with $1 billion in repurchases in the back half of the year. as we look beyond that, we have not changed our strategy nor our expectations of strong earnings growth and returns over our plan horizon. and as we laid out at our global investor day, there are upside opportunities to our medium-term plan. but as we have already covered today, we are advancing those now and realizing higher value from them.
higher biosolutions revenue growth, higher health & wellness op contributions, the operational transformation across the enterprise, we expect these and more to add further upside in the medium term. the opportunities before us are significant. i'm proud of what our team has achieved, but i'm even more excited about what we're going to deliver tomorrow, next year and in the years to come. with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
