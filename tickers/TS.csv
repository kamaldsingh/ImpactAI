ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the tenaris fourth quarter and annual results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna, investor relations officer, tenaris. please go ahead.
giovanni sardagna -- director-investor relations
thank you, victor, and welcome to tenaris 2019 fourth quarter and annual results conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that during this call we will be discussing forward-looking information and that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during the call. with me on the call today are paolo rocca, chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors, gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations.
i would like to start by mentioning that we will host an investor presentation in london on april the 3rd and we hope to see many of you there. before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. during the fourth quarter of 2019 sales reach $1.7 billion down 17% compared with those of the corresponding quarter of the previous year, and 1% sequentially. mainly as a result of the slowdown in activity in argentina and lower prices in the americas. our quarterly ebitda at $290 million was down 10% sequentially and our ebitda margins decreased to around 17% mainly due to a drop in average selling prices and higher professional fees mainly related to the closing of the ipsco acquisition for around $10 million.
average selling prices in our tubes operating segments declined 3% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2018 and 3% sequentially. during the quarter, cash flow from operation was $264 million, our net cash position rose by $60 million to $990 million following the payment of an interim dividend of $153 million in november last year and capital expenditure of $80 million. the board of director has decided to propose for the approval of the annual journal shareholders meetings to be held at the end of april, the payment of an annual dividend of $0.41 per share or $0.82 per adr, which includes the interim dividend of $0.13 per share or $0.26 per adr that we paid at the end of november of last year. if approved a dividend of $0.28 per share or $0.56 per adr will be paid on may 20.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you very much, giovanni. good morning to all of you. 2019 was a more difficult year tenaris than we expected. the adjustment in drilling activity in the us fields and response lower cash flow and the less accommodating financing environment was prolonged and only now as we begin 2020, we are starting to see activities realizing at the level 25% lower than it was a year ago. but i think in the americas, we're also affected by the drop in us activity, coupled with a partial resurgence of us domestic welded pipe production following the steep fall in cultural steel prices in the first part of the year.
meanwhile, in argentina, political and economic uncertainty in the second half of the year has resulted in a sharp fall in investment activity in boca marta. in saudi arabia, aramco started lnt destocking process, which may last through the end of this year. against these background tenaris has achieved important milestone and strengthen its position in key markets. on safety, we have made good progress over the past two years. our lost time injury frequency rate is all but to an annual average of 1.2 lost time accident per million an hour work including contract. and in the fourth quarter of 2019, we were able to reduce it to below one. this reflected consistent management focus over years, and the cultural change that we've been able to extend to our 45 facility around the world. financially, we have work hard to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. on sales of $7.3 billion, our free cash flow margin was 16% for the year, as we reduce working capital by over $500 million. at year end, our net cash position had risen by $495 million to $980 million after maintaining our annual dividend payments in $484 million over the year and acquiring 48% of saudi steel pipe for $132 million in january.
even with the acquisition of ipsco after the close of the year, we have net debt free balance sheet. we were finally able to complete the acquisition of ipsco on january 2, after receiving clearance from the us authorities in late december. this process lasted nine months, much longer than we had anticipated. during this time, the market deteriorated in our rig direct competitors, the distributor, were able to switch their pipe purchases away from ipsco current producers. consequently, we are now integrating a company operating at a loss with high inventory and with many production facilities shut down. these will act as a drag on our first quarter results. but we are acting rapidly to reduce costs to recover market share and implement the synergies we identify with the transaction. despite the changing market condition and the lower activity level and demand, all the assumptions that originally justify the acquisition remain valid, and it will strengthen our commercial, industrial and technological leadership in the us market.
with the copper electric arc furnaces the shopper we now have our first steel making facility in the us, which will be able to supply with limited investment. a significant portion of our steel requirement for the enbridge and bay city mill. and the geographical distribution of the acquired asset will add pass to strengthen our rig direct service and reduce lead time, particularly in the northern part of the us. the contribution of the enhanced team and expansion of our technology portfolio will further strengthen our positioning in the us market. also, in the us, our bay city mill has reached targeted levels of production and efficiency and is fully prepared to further enhance our competitive position. during the year, we strengthen our position in saudi arabia through the integration of saudi steel pipe, even if in the current market condition, this is not yet fully reflected in our cash flow. in abu dhabi, we successfully won a long- term contract value at $1.9 billion to supply the majority of adnoc's octg requirement over the next five years. this will start to be reflected in our cash flow from mid-2020. we have a strong focus on reducing the environmental impact of our operation, whether locally in our communities or more globally, through addressing the challenge of climate change.
during 2019, we completed important investments to improve air quality and reduce our environmental footprint at our mills in argentina and mexico. in other parts of our industrial system, we also have industry leading emission level. on bay city mill for example is the only operation of its type qualified in usa is a minor source of emission. with respect to co2 emission, we have relatively low levels of emission compared to our competitor and other steelmakers since we only use electric furnaces and gas based direct reduction or firearm for steelmaking. we have also integrated the gas fired combined cycle power generation for a large proportion of our production. over the past five years, we have reduced the co2 emission intensity of our operation by 18% to 1.18 tons of co2 per ton of steel. this is a 35% below the global average for steelmaking reported by the world steel. this data as referring to the four major facilities that also have steelmaking. as i mentioned before, we have overall worldwide 45 facility operating, but the steelmaking operation are focus on four and now on five conceding also the acquired asset income.
sustainability has longer been embedded in our managing, management practices and we look forward to leading our industry response to the global climate challenge. during 2020, we do not expect a substantial change in the market environment, but it's still difficult to assess the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy and oil prices. however, the repositioning the u.s. when the integration of ipsco. the action we are taking worldwide to reduce costs to increase efficiency in our industrial system, and to reduce lead time in our supply chain for deliver to recover our margins to around 20%.
i will stop here and leave the floor open for any question we have.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from a line of igor levi from btig. you may begin.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
good morning. so, based on the north american numbers you reported being slightly up assuming mexico is up and canada slightly seasonably up. it implies that the u.s. was only down marginally, when the rig count was down more than 10% in the quarter. could you talk about the reason for this outperformance of the rig count and just a bit more on the market in the u.s. and whether we've seen the trough in u.s. octg demand?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, igor. i think despite over reduction in the size of america, we've been able to maintain our position but i will ask to luca zanotti to comment on the situation in the american market.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
thank you, paolo. good morning. igor. as you certainly notice, international competitors that additionally targeted that the u.s. market eventually encountered difficulties to export this market. and so, as a consequence, imports dropped significantly to 35% of the demand in the fourth quarter of 2019. and leveraging our redirect model and our large manufacturing footprint in the united states. we were able to tap into this space, and therefore we're able to maintain flat our sales.
now looking ahead, what we see is that given current circumstances, we don't see this situation to change. as a matter of fact, if we can consider the import license of january 2020, they were pretty low. so, we expect to be able to maintain our levels.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
thank you. guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of ian macpherson from simmons. you may begin.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
thank you. good morning. good afternoon. i was wondering if you could perhaps talk about the level of results that you saw from the ipsco assets in the fourth quarter. and maybe quantify for us how much of a drag it represents in q1, because i know that you have an objective to capture integration benefits in synergies as we march through the year, but maybe if you're talking about margins being flat from q4 and q1, how much of that is the impact of the ipsco drag in q1?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
whether you are right that due to the lengthy process to clear the transaction, through the anti-threat and the doj. the company has been subjected to important stress during 2019. so, the ebitda of the company and loan went down, it became negative in the q and even more negative in the 4q of 2019. now in the 1q this will have a drag on our results because we cannot turn around the situation within the very, very short period of time. but we are acting very fast on all front, we're expected to be able to reduce fast the drag and gradually to get to the synergies that were embedded in our business plan since the very beginning.
as i mentioned before, in my prepared statement, all the consideration and that led us to the acquisition are still very valid. and in the first month, in which we get contact with the people, the operation, the technology, we're confirming, let's say the rationale and objectives of acquisition, but we will have a drag and this drag is also embedded in a high level of inventory in the company because the company in the end reacted slowly to the change of policy by the distribution system. so we have a level of inventory that are priced at a level that is reflecting the cost and are different from the cost that we have. so there will be a gradual reduction of this inventory and this will be part of the drag that i mentioned for the 1q. i will ask luca to comment on the path, the roadmap and the synergy that we plan to get in the coming quarters.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
yes, paolo, thank you. good morning, ian. specifically to seen as is what we have seen when we started looking into the company carefully, we see that, compared to what we previously announced that we see a higher level of synergies, we estimate annual run rate in the range of $80 million to $100 million. now those synergies will come from four main buckets. the first one is the optimization of the location, we want to be certainly favoring the most efficient and lower costs mills. and at the same time, we want to reduce logistic costs allocating in proximity of the consumption is forecasted. the second is going to be capacity reduction. and i believe that what we done following the previous management is already public, but we right size production capacity. the third one is coming from the fixed cost reduction arriving from our integration. and fourth is driving from the operation and purchasing/ make or buy decision. so as i said before, these four main buckets are supposed to bring between us $80 million and us $100 million. we expect those synergies to kick in gradually and fully era 0:19:24.6and to accrue the full benefit toward the end of 2020 in the last quarter of 2020.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
thanks, luca and paolo. my follow up question. i wondered if you could maybe provide some range of the expectations for first quarter revenues given the stabilization of your base business and then the full almost a full quarter capture of top line even though at a dilutive margin from ipsco. that would help provide helping, helpful starting point for us.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
the first quarter, as you remember in three months ago, we were considering that we should have had a positive impact from reduction in our cost coming from the lower price of getting through our inventory from lower level of maintenance because last year we hit some, over run a maintenance and some change we make. now what we see today will be affected by the drag of ipsco acquisition. some of the cost related to the closing of the transaction. we have lawyers and consultants that are supporting as there will be some costs related to the final closing that happens in january. but there are specific issue that we need to complete during this month concerning inventory assessment and so on. and the pipe logix reduction, we didn't anticipate in october, but the pipe logix went down between october and january by another additional 5%. so, this has an impact. these are affecting the improvement that we're considering for the 1q. so, we now assume that in the 1q, ebitda ratio should be and the margin should be in the range of the 4q. so, the 1q will be more or less aligned in our view in terms of margin with 4q.
now, from that point on, we expect things to start to improve and we expect in the second part of the year to be able to get to the level of margins that we had in the first half of 2019 which is around the 20% margin by the time.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
thanks, paolo, i understand the margin guidance, i don't understand what we're talking about in terms of top line as a starting point for the year.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
in the top line, i think that considering the reduction in pipe logix that occur up to now, we will also be able to recover gradually, but if you look at, let's say, the entire company we expected that in the second half of 2020. we will be-top line in the range again of the first half of 2019.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
thank you. that's that's helpful. i'll pass it over.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from line out sean meakim from jpmorgan. you may begin.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. so, maybe just to continue on to that line of thinking. we think about the decline in pipe logix pricing in the fourth quarter. what's the average pricing that we should be thinking about in the first quarter relative to 4q? i mean how much do we need to? if we're stabilizing here, how much do we need to catch up first quarter relative to 4q and then just can we distinguish between seamless and welded?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think considering the shift and the mix worldwide between let's say different region or if we are referring to the company as a whole in order to, it is more difficult to give a clear answer on the level of pricing for this. the 5% reduction that we have seen between the 4q, and the 1q is in the pipe logix but it didn't reflect entirely in our pricing. so, from that point on, we also will be recovering. the difference in contract, long -term contract, short- term sales makes a little more difficult to forecast how the recovering prize may happens during 2020.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and then maybe talk a bit more about ipsco. so, you started the year maybe not as good as you were thought a few months ago, understandable given all the moving parts. it seems like the distributors maybe are getting through a lot of the destocking process in north america, could you give us a sense of your expectations for ipscos contribution to cash flow in 2020.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
as i mentioned before, this would be growing over time but luca maybe you can add some comment on the cash flow coming from ipsco during 2020 after say the first quarter -
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
yes, paolo. good morning, sean. as i was anticipating before we see ipsco with a negative profitability. and then thanks to the two things that paolo already mentioned in his opening. so, a recovery in volumes and the full implementation of the synergies action, we are going to see profitability to improve and get positive in the second half of 2020.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and so, we think about capex associated with the business on a full year basis. do we think that its cash flow positive or is in 2020 as we're working through the processes that may be a net use of cash for the year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, at this point in time, we are looking at-let's say the investment level for the entire company considering the possibility that it will be really operational in this. we consider that the company should as a whole tenaris to have capital investment in the range of $350 million to $360 million including the investment that i mentioned to expand the range of the couple continues capital so, to be able to supply the entire, the entire american system bay city on an average. we will have to invest on this and so as a whole these will be in the range of $360 million investment in capital. now, the ebitda, we expect ebitda of the single bdd the ipsco asset to become positive in the second half of 2020.
giovanni sardagna -- director-investor relations
right.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thank you for that feedback.
operator
thank you. and our next question is from the line of marc bianchi from cowen. you may begin.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
thank you, i guess first, just back on the pipe logix question, maybe not so much related to how it affects your revenue here in the first and second quarter, but just on a leading-edge basis, given the commentary about, low imports and maybe we're inventory set. how do you see the pipe logix pricing index progressing from here?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
we expect the recovery, we expect the recovery after let's say, deployment that has been reaching the demand. frankly, i think we should be bottoming out from here, but i would ask, luca, if he can share his feeling and by logic is bottoming out.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
yes. thank you. good morning, marc. i believe this year we need to consider different pcs. and the first one that you should tell me i've also seen is that recently and there is a number of an array on a look at the results that are coming in from the users, you have seen increase in negative ebitda generational from some competitors, industrial restructuring. from other competitors, recapitalization format as well and this is the first part.
the second, you're seeing that toward the end of 2019 competitors to announce price increases. and overall, these are all signs that the industry is in a situation that really needs prices to up. i share your point and i believe that we are scraping the bottom of the barrel and i see prices going up in the future.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think that really, we should be touching bottom and these level of pipe logix and prices is basically unsustainable in the medium term for the competitors, domestic and global competitor for the us, for the us market.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thanks for that. i wanted to go back to ipsco and the losses a few questions really.-.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me add on-sorry, let me add one comment here to make it just to give you man here we are considering that there is no more relevant impact from coronavirus, no. i mean if because this is discussion, we have without considering additional disruption coming from the coronavirus on the level of economic activity worldwide in china, and maybe consequently on the price of all in china. so is a scenario the one that we are mentioning to you, there is a consistent with a level of rigs in the level of it and i mean, and no major disruption in the main variable of this, if something happens on this ground, obviously things would be could be different. sorry to interrupt you.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
no, thank you, that's helpful. makes sense. in terms of the ipsco. the impact on results here, so it's negative right now or sounds like it's going to be negative in the first half. can you help quantify just on an ebitda basis? what we're talking about here? is it like a $10 million kind of drag per quarter? or is it much more substantial than that? and then are we talking about breakeven?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, as i mentioned before, what do we expect today, considering these impact and considering the other elements of that i mentioned, still our margin in the first quarter should be in line with the margin of the 4q.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
okay, and is there-you mentioned some professional fees and such. i would suspect that there might also be some restructuring if you're, changing some of the fixed costs there. is there a number that you care to quantify as to how much of a onetime headwind some of those things could be in the first half?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
this was a component that was including in the consideration of costs related to the integration of ipsco. let's say, i don't know, in this moment, i wouldn't give a figure, but i don't know if, luca, you could have an estimate that there will be a -.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
there will be some additional cost. we ask people together the numbers and but certainly we need to consider that on top of what you just mentioned before some several answer that we want any that to materialize the synergies on the fixed course.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thank you very much. we'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of stephen gengaro from stifel. you may begin.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thank you. good morning. just i think two things. one, just to follow up on marc's question, those costs associated with the integration, are they part of your flat ebitda margin guidance for 1q or are they not included in that number?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
adding to that, i mean, when i say for this is a forecast but for the 1q, we expect to be able to reach margin in line with the fourth quarter, including this let's say extraordinary expenditure for the integration of ipsco and is a first to as a restructuring. and we will incur between now and in the end of march.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then i guess two other things actually. the first is we looked at ipscos numbers for 2018. and we sort of thought about some detrimental margins to get the negative ebitda. it seems like the revenue run rate on a quarterly basis is kind of like in the 175 to 200 range right now. is that a reasonable guess for the first quarter?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
can you say it again, because i didn't understand that?
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
sure. so, i think-it seems like ipsco is about $1.3 billion in revenue in 2018. and just looking at where the markets stand and looking at the fact that they've moved to an ebitda negative position in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. it seems like their quarterly revenue is running a little bit under $200 million. is that a reasonable starting point?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think i would say even lower than what you mentioned. i mean the compression in revenue that happens during the nine months in which we completed discussion with the antitrust has been substantial. so, the company enter into a strong squeeze for on the top line well below, let's say in the 4q the $200 million that you mentioned, and on a negative ebitda that also is relevant at this time. now the only change in the first quarter but in the fourth quarter has been below what you mentioned as a top line for ipsco.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then just one final one when you think about your rig direct models and you think about moving ipsco volumes through rig direct, based on conversations with customers that you've had since the deal closed. are you -what's your sort of optimism around how rapidly you can kind of get the ipsco volumes to ramped back up through the rig direct distribution system?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, at this time will be tenaris act as a whole expanding its portfolio with the existing client and establishing let's say in constructing some of the client, existing client also fixed. we will gain ground. i think during 2020 pretty fast. but i will ask luca how the clients are reacting. and if you see room for this catch up and the rebuilding of the customer base and enhancing the expansion of this.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
yes, paolo. first of all, we need to mention that we have commitment that was taken by ipsco. and of course, we're going to respect those commitments. so, i mean, the speed at which we're going to be switching to either it also depends on the previous commitment that they can make. going into the specific question, well, we don't see these any more difficult than what we did in the beginning. actually, we see these much easier because let's remember that we started from scratch in 2015 and in 2017, we were having he range of 60% of our sales. today, the understanding of the us customer base is much higher than to what we were at the beginning. so, we don't have to go and explain everything from scratch. so, i see this happening through 2020 and according also to the commitments that were taken by ipsco in the past, but i believe that we can complete these through these this year.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of hoy sanns [phonetic] from goldman sachs, you may begin.
hoy sanns -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. if i can start with another one on ipsco, please. how should we think about the normalized through the cycle margins for ipsco and how would that be different under your management versus previous management?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'm not sure i mean i didn't-in this integration that we are carried on in the sense, really, we will manage the entire system in a unified way since day one. so it's correct to say the level of invoicing of ipsco went down through 2019; it touch around $200 million in the third 3q and then went down again substantially in the 4q, but at this point in time, we are looking at this is as tenaris' challenge would be difficult to understand or to separate ipsco from tenaris. we are looking at our combine market share and i would say that it will not be something like a normalized level of ipsco operation.
we will also allocate material in the most efficient mill for rolling, forecasting for finishing or key treatment in a system that will be based on many different mills in the us. what we think, we should do and we are very confident we could do is that we will be able to establish the leadership as tenaris sales, in volume in service and in technology and our market share. we get to the level that we design and we have in mind when we launch the acquisition of ipsco more than one year ago.
hoy sanns -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. and then a second question can be away from the us. can we get some more color on pricing in the international market please?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, saha. i would ask, gabriella, to give a view how we perceive the attention to this at least up to now and further condition.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. thank you, paolo. good morning, saha. the pricing in the significant international market remain competitive is really as decoupled from the pipe logix dynamic that we were mentioning before. so, there is not a direct link. there is a very limited impact of the pipe logix into the indoor formulas of some work on the international market, but this is very limited. we have a positive momentum in our average pricing even our backlog of kind of rich mix due to the gas developments immediately some offshore as well. so, year-over-year that pricing moves in a positive dynamic within a competitive environment. and we also see some tightness in some specific niches of our service, corrosion resistant alloys where we are able to push some price increases, but this has a limited impact in the overall portfolio vis-a-vis of the dynamic at the general level.
hoy sanns -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you, gabriel.
operator
thank you. and our next question will come from line of alessandro pozzi from mediobanca. you may begin.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
good morning, all. the first question is on cash flow for 2020. just wondering in particular, how do you expect your conference call to evolve? clearly, we've seen a positive contribution in 2019. i was wondering how much positive contribution to expect if any from working capital in 2020?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, alessandro. we also -we continue to intervene on the entire supply chain on the lead time and we think that the integration with ipsco will also support after the initial period in which we have to reduce the inventory that we are receiving with ipsco. we will continue to reduce inventory and we expect to have positive contribution in the range of some $200 million or in this range during 2020. so, this we contribute to our cash flow. we are confident that we will get a very strong cash flow in 2020.
the recovery in the managing in the second part of the year combined with a relatively contained level of investment and the reduction in working capital. so that allow us to be able to give a robust cash flow in 2020.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
and do you already have in mind what net cash you could end up with the year-end?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's like i said what we can always considering let's say this situation is today without, let's say irrelevant slow down or the economy or reduction in level of, we can see there that as we mentioned before we can have a level of cash flow similar to the level that we had in 2019.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay, and just one thing on the capex, i think you mentioned the 50 to 60. and that doesn't include the ipsco on the capex as well?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, we are including the investment that we are planning to undertake in the especially in the couple in short to advance in the capability to supply the entire needs of the us operation from-.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay, finally just the last one on the -you mentioned global otg demand is like to fall in 2020, i was wondering if you can maybe give us a bit more color on where you see-which regions you see more strength there?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i will say that in 2020 we're considering that will be, there will be as low recovery in argentina. we do not expect so much from the demand in argentina in the first part of the year until some of the key issues of the economic plan will be defined and negotiation also for the debt will be completed. but then we will see argentina could be capital -could be let's say increasing expanding the market in the second half. and the second area, so our view is important is the gulf of mexico from the both the american and the mexican, the mexican side. the international company are working actively in mexico, but in the gulf of mexico we are seeing project going on. we have the contract adnoc that i mentioned in my prepared remark, we have the very large contract, the majority of the need of the adnoc. we estimate around $1.9 billion in a period of five year.
this will kick in during the second part of the year in our review and it depends also from how fast adnoc will work on this. another area that could be positive for 2020 second part is brazil. we have an important market share in brazil. if and it seems petrobras and private company and international company are maintaining the programs of drilling. this would be also a positive area in one is a niche, but these deals important is that the connector that we sell worldwide in for the offshore project are also an area in which we will expand i would say. so, these are the area in which we may have say positive development during the course of 2020. they may compensate for a relatively weak demand due to destocking in saudi and the argentina situation as far as we can see today.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you.

hi, there. thanks. i've just got two. the first one is regarding those extraordinary expenses you mentioned still related to ipsco for q1. can you give us a rough ballpark or estimate of what those will total during the quarter?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
extraordinary expansion ipsco, luca?
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.
yes, paolo. i mean as i said before, we are still finalizing the number, but we expect this to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million.
aaron spence -- jeffries -- analyst
okay. apologies if i missed say that number again. so the second one, when you talk about the second half 2020 improvement at ipsco and it turned into a positive contribution, is that driven by any forecast around improve pricing, or is that predominantly due to your expectations around synergies and maybe some better volumes.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
as i mentioned before, i think the present level of pricing and it's difficult to sustain. so we're assuming that there will be-there could be some limited rebound, but at least in this. but mainly what we are counting on the synergies that luca was mentioning before due to location to restructuring of the production system efficiency and some cost reduction that we can get in working integrating the two company.
aaron spence -- jeffries -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of lillian starke from morgan stanley, you may begin.
lillian starke -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. just one quick question from my end. you mentioned the accumulated inventory at ipsco, i was just wondering if at any point you think we could expect an impairment on the back of these or are these two do you expect to be put in the market just at a lower margin?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, according to a contract, we're reviewing the inventory. we have been assured quality condition of the inventory and then we have to close the contract. and the agreement with tmk based on this. once we completed the set, i expect no impairment, we expect to be able to send to the market. but as i mentioned before, the cost of sales for this product and these inventory is higher than the average cost of sales for the material we provide on the rest of the facility. so this is part of the drag that we will have in the first quarter.
let me tell you that gradually the new production and the new material in our view will be competitive. and, of course after the intervention and the restructuring we will have now, we didn't complete the first stage, which is the overall assessment of inventory we have, according to the contract 75 days to complete this. in general, this is the sense we have, there are no major issue coming from this.
lillian starke -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of amelia [phonetic] from santander. you may begin.
amelia -- santander -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for the call. so i have a couple questions from my side. the first one is related to the ipsco acquisition and the margins that you mentioned the 20% level for the second half of 2020. it's just a quick question, if you do include the synergies that you mentioned the $80 million to $100 million in synergies for this 20% margin for the second half of 2020.
and my second question is related to the jv you made in russia in siberia if you-how is that going if you're spending any cash on that, and if you could, if you are -if you could give us a breakdown of how much is going toward that, that'd be interesting to know also. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. on the first point, what i mentioned the recovery of the margin to get back to the range of 20%. i'm considering this is the margin for whole of the tenaris. these considering all of the element of the company to it. including the synergy that we plan to have in gradually into this. as we mentioned $80 million to $100 million fee but we can expect to enter starting gradually i mean, say gradually but we need to plan to reach it by the fourth quarter for sure.
the second one on russian venture, we are proceeding for an investment. we will be investing during 2020. maybe gabrielle, you can comment on how things are going on in the russia.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes, paolo, thank you very much. good morning, rodrigo. indeed, jv in russia is progressing very well. they have a greater understanding and dialogue and cooperation with our partner service club. we advancing full speed in the engineering and the construction targeting us plan commissioning of the facility by the second half of 2021. so we're looking forward to complete the facility another line of business.
in terms of capex, our provision is around $70 million for 2020 and probably a similar number or a bit lower into 2021.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
this figure is not included. i mean is in the $350 million -
amelia -- santander -- analyst
no, it's not included in the $360 million because this is our participation in the joint venture. so we're expecting to our investment in 2020 will be $70 million. and in 2019 we invested about $20 million.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is our participation joint venture, so it's not considered a part of the $360 million that we are mentioned as capex.
amelia -- santander -- analyst
and it is our...
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
but are included in the overall vision of the cash flow that i gave before.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the tenaris second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna, investor relations officer. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
thank you and welcome to tenaris 2020 second quarter conference call.
before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in this call and that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during the call.
with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our us operations.
before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment on quarterly results. our sales for the second quarter were down 30% sequentially to $1.2 billion as a consequence of the rapid decline of the economic activity and the collapse in global oil demand as a result of the measures taken to contain the spread of the covid-19 pandemic around the world.
average selling prices in our tubes operating segment increased 8% sequentially due to a particularly good mix of products sold during the quarter. our ebitda for the quarter, which includes $54 million of severance charges, was down 79% sequentially as it was affected by the low absorption of fixed and semi-fixed cost and inefficiencies related to the steep decline in capacity utilization at our production facilities. our ebitda margin decreased to around 5%. excluding severance charges, our ebitda for the quarter would have been $113 million with a margin of 9%.
during the quarter, our free cash flow remained strong at $402 million, with a further reduction in working capital of $446 million. consequently, our net cash position at the end of the quarter improved to $670 million.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni, and good morning to all of you.
the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the diverse measures taken to contain it continue to be felt around the world. while we may have seen the big impact on global economic activity and oil consumption during the second quarter, further recovery will be slow and this led to uncertainty. many parts of the world have still to come out of the lock down, other are being hit by fresh outbreaks infection, and there is a constant risk of further waves of infection. while we are still far from finding a definitive solution, which would allow us to resume many activities that we took for granted prior to the pandemic onset.
all aspect of our operation has been affected as we implemented actions to secure the safety of our employees, complying with government-mandated restriction on activity, support the medical response effort in our communities, accelerated digital integration and remote working protocols with our customers, adapt rapidly to an exceptionally low level of production and implement measures to reduce cost and working capital.
i would like to give a special mention and thanks to all our employees who have responded and adapted to the challenges that we are facing with exemplary resolve and solidarity in these difficult times.
our second quarter results reflect the advances we have made in our plan to reduce structural costs and working capital and prepare ourselves for the market we see ahead. as we prioritize cash flow over operating results, we have reduced our level of operation well below that of our sales to reduce inventories, and we are incurring a higher cost of operation from sub-absorption of fixed costs as we do so. in the coming months, we will continue to generate cash flow from reduction in working capital.
we are currently more than halfway through our plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by around $220 million by the year-end. and the savings are beginning to be reflected in these results. we're also applying suspensions and adjusting our workforce in accordance with the local realities of our operation around world while retaining the key people which we will require once the markets start to recover.
we significantly reduced our level of capital expenditure to $46 million during the quarter. we are maintaining investment in what we consider essential element for our long-term objective and particularly in environment and in safety. in safety, we have made good results in the last quarter, and we are proud of the continued improvement in our safety investment -- in our safety indicators so far this year and our effort to maintain a covid-19 free working environment.
our sales during the quarter were deeply affected by the rapid decline in drilling activity in the us and canada, the impact of the pandemic and collapse in drilling activity in argentina and colombia as well as an ongoing slowdown in mexico. with our rig direct model, our octg sales in these countries adjust almost immediately with changes in the drilling activity.
in the us, there are large inventories overhang, and wells drilled and awaiting completion and in oil [indecipherable]. octg inventories have risen to around 15 months of consumption, and this is impacting the demand level and pricing. our sales in the middle east and offshore are showing more resilience. this was a particularly good quarter for us in the caspian and the north sea. in the north sea, we completed deliveries for the remaining wells in culzean, began deliveries to the glengorm development and recently won an award to supply exploration well for the neptune, a rig field in norway. these are all very complex developments, and our success has been built on the outstanding performance of our product and the benefit of our rig direct service.
in the gulf, we are well positioned with good visibility in saudi arabia, in the emirates and qatar, where we expect drilling activity to continue to be resilient despite lower oil and gas prices. in recent days, we have reached agreement for a two year extension on our long-term agreements with enea [phonetic], with petrobras and with pioneer. we were also awarded a one year extension on our section 232 exclusion for the import of steel bar for our bay city mills. while we advanced with the investment we are making in our koppel steel shop in pennsylvania so that it will be able to supply bars to be city starting from next year.
in the coming months, we will be focused on reducing cost and working capital and position the company for an extended downturn and advancing with our long-term strategy. this includes digital integration of the supply chain with our customers, where we have made substantial progress in the past month. through our direct -- rig direct portal, customer can directly load their order into our system, and today, 44% of rig direct call -- callout requests in the us are managed this way.
through our pipetracer tool, we provide pipe-by-pipe tracking and traceability, which allow for more efficient well planning and supply chain integration. we've reduced pipe handling and fuel inspection [indecipherable]. we are advancing system integration with larger customers in the permian, colombia and argentina. in response to pandemic, we have begun providing well integrity service remotely to offshore platform in the north sea, the gulf of mexico and the asia pacific, and have reorganized our technical training service for online delivery. as customers seek further ways to reduce cost and streamline operations, they are looking on -- at how the digital integration can reduce cost in the supply chain.
also, drilling activity may be starting to bottom out worldwide. the oil and gas industry continues to have a large overhang of inventories and production operation capacity, which will take an extended period of time to bring back into a more stable balance. oil and gas companies have reduced capital budgets and are postponing projects, which will delay the recovery in drilling activity. in this environment, demand for our products and service will continue to be deeply affected through the rest of the year. eventually, the oil and gas industry will need to resume investing at a faster pace to assure an adequate supply of energy to the world in its recovery from this crisis.
thank you. we can now take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of sean meakim from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
sean christopher meakim -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
thank you. good morning.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
sean christopher meakim -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
so paolo, just to start, the challenges in 3q and the guide on margins make sense. but i'm a little surprised that the optimism for 4q that was in the press release, how much of that would you say is driven by seasonality helping activity versus the impact of achieving more of your cost reduction plans or other factors? can you maybe just walk us through the thought process for the fourth quarter?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sean. well, what we are saying in the outlook is that we will see that the third q is really the bottom of this operation and we should start to pick up very slowly. but we anticipate some recovery in area like, for instance, argentina. argentina, we expect that after negotiation -- renegotiation of the debt, something will start to move. remember, we had 60 rigs at the beginning of the year. we went down to zero. today, we are probably around 15 rigs operational.
there will be some pickup in the activity also for assuring the supply of gas needed for the domestic market in the next winter in 2021. this is one area in which we expect some recovery. we may imagine that also gradually, there will be some level of activity in the united states that may be also coming from this. and on our -- in the rest of our region, we expect there could be some slight recovery during the fourth quarter. that's the reasons that are supporting our statement in the outlook.
sean christopher meakim -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. and then -- so considering the decline in activity that we've seen in the forward outlook for the next couple of years. have you given more thought internally to taking out additional costs? is that on the table for 2021? just curious how you think about the efficacy of the cost-out program so far and potential plans or thoughts around increasing or upsizing that amount of cost you could take out of the business.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think there is a high uncertainty in the evolution of the economy and the demand when the pandemic crisis will, to some extent, recede. so, not easy to forecast the level of activity that we may expect in 2021. our cost containment is basically focused on reduction of our fixed cost that, as we anticipated, is under way. and we plan to complete this part of our reduction within in the coming two quarters before the end of the year.
then there is also the containment of the cost of the operation of the plant. today, we have a suspension agreement in place, different instrument in different countries. we wish we are absorbing the cost of idle crews in different mills. this is a component of our cost that depending on our forecast maybe -- may change. there are areas of further adjustment from this point of view, in the case that we perceive that the recovery will continue at a very slow pace.
sean christopher meakim -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
understood. that's really helpful. thank you very much.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of frank mcgann from bank of america. your line is now open.
frank j. mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you very much. i was just wondering, just following up a little bit on the last question. just thinking long term, how do you see -- when do you think you're going to get back to a kind of normal operations? and i assume that will be a few years out, but how do you see kind of a return to normal? and in that process, do you see industry consolidation continuing? and do you see opportunities for yourselves perhaps to pick up additional assets in that time frame?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think it's very speculative to try to understand or to predict what's happened in this recovery. but from my point of view -- i think that in some region, we may be surprised by a faster recovery. for instance, in the case of china, china is recovering very fast. if you look at consumption activity, the economic activity, production and consumption of steel, we are -- have been surprised in the last months by how fast this recovery is proceeding, and this is spreading to some of the asian countries. so this will -- is a factor that will be important in 2021. how fast will -- this will continue.
then there is the european and us recovery. there is some kind of pent-up demand there after the pandemia [phonetic]. and in the case that a recovery speed up the demand for energy, like in china and other asian countries may pick up faster. but this, as i was saying in the beginning, is just speculative. our operation has been affected today by the reduction in the level of investment of the oil company, but this level of investment is probably be unsustainable if the world require a steady supply of oil and gas at a slightly higher level of demand.
our operation has been affected by the reduction of the investment in north americas, from canada to us to mexico and latin america. if the price of oil went above $45 per barrel and the brent, we will also see some higher activity in 2021. but it's very difficult today to anticipate this trend. we are still in the middle of the crisis. and sometimes in the middle of the crisis, you tend to see reality with a more pessimistic view, but something will change in my view.
frank j. mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. okay. understandable. just real quickly, do you expect to take further severance charges as you continue to downsize some of your operations in the third and fourth quarters?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
sorry, can you repeat because i didn't listen. if i -- if we see -- frank?
frank j. mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
do you expect to see to take further severance charges as you continue to cut costs and just headcount in the third and fourth quarters?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, our adjustment plan started. we incur in severance in the range of 70 plus million dollars -- $75 million. we were expecting, anticipated a number in the range of $100 million, $120 million so the rest, around $50 million is something that we expect to incur in the second half of this year. now, the savings coming from this are -- start to get into our results. and we will perceive these savings even more in the coming quarter.
frank j. mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of igor levi from btig. your line is now open.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
good morning, guys. i'd like to ask a bit more details on what you're seeing in pricing. so far, the us is down about 25% from a year ago. in the last downturn, pricing fell as much as 40%. so do you expect -- are you seeing a further decline? and also, what are you seeing internationally where pricing typically lags the us? and could that potentially be a headwind in the second half?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, igor. well, as you are saying, pricing -- the prices went down during last year and continue to went down even last month. but i think there is not so much room for additional decline because of also the trend on the cost is turning, you look at the price of iron ore and scrap, the price is picking up. something is happening here. i was mentioning before that china is increasing its production and consumption of steel. this is driving increase in the price of iron ore. iron ore is close to record level in -- and so this is supporting also the level of price in our market.
for the first time, the price of hot rolled coils in china are higher than the price of hot rolled coil in the us. this is something that didn't happen in the past, is an indicator of the recovery in china, but it's also something that is having an impact on prices of all of the competitors -- on the cost of all of the competitor. so in my view, there is not so much room for additional reduction in prices. it is true that in the state, there is an overhang of inventory and this is always something that could have some temporary impact. but structurally, i see that there is not so much room for additional reduction in pricing.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you. and then looking at your free cash flow, you've already generated $850 million in the first half, mainly from working capital. how much more working capital reduction do you think you guys could realize in the second half of this year? and what kind of net debt or net cash in your case levels are you targeting by the end of the year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
basically, in line with what we said in the last quarter, we'll continue to generate free cash flow in the third and fourth q. we confirm that we expect to arrive by the end of the year with a net cash position in the range of $1 billion. this is due also to our business model. the business model based on the rig direct allow us to reduce our inventory more or less in line with the level of activity. so we expect from inventories and receivable to be able to generate -- to continue to generate free cash flow in the coming quarter.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
thank you. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alessandro pozzi from mediobanca. your line is now open.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
thank you. i have two questions. so the first one is a bit more broader picture. so this is the third crisis in the last 10 years. and every time we had gloomy predictions on the oil price, and every time we've seen a bounce back to various degrees. i was wondering, how do you prepare the company for the next 10 years? and do you still -- do you think you will continue to generate most of the revenues from octg in 10 years' time or do you think this is the right time to diversify the business?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, alessandro. i think that we are getting through a crisis. difficult, obviously, to predict. in the meantime, we are in a long-term trend of concentration and redefinition of the competitive environment in the oil industry and also on the oil service company. we are an oil service company in this. i think that we are prepared to play the game in this segment and to prepare for a recovery. as i mentioned in the opening remarks, this level of investment could not support the demand of energy that the world inevitably will need when it will come out from the pandemic. so we'll need to be prepared to support a higher level of investment.
having said so, we are diversifying within our sector because in the end, tenaris is also supplying other segment of the industry, like hydrogen or renewable, we are -- we have an increasing business in that sector because in the end, also, for instance, hydrogen or co2, ccs and capture and storage of co2 are also requiring infrastructure. that is the infrastructure in which we participate. this segment today is a few percentage points of our revenues, but is increasing fast. and it requires very special product, it requires sophisticated product design for this, and we are very well prepared for this. so we think that we need to look at the long-term for tenaris having in mind the competitive environment in the industry we serve, competitive environment in our sector and also the niche that are coming out from a different transformation of the energy industry, and this is what we are doing.
at the same time, we need to understand how we can transform the way we operate. the digitalization of the supply chain is one point, but there is also a digital transformation of our industrial activity. and tenaris has always been focused on local presence in different markets. and i think that this strategy is the one that we will continue to follow to be able to serve the industry and the place in which we operate in a world that may be a little less global and a little more local in some of the region. i think this fits with our strategy, and we will pursue this everywhere in the world.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay. that was very clear. thank you. and a follow-up on labor costs. i think that we've seen a big improvement in q2. i was wondering how much of labor costs could be further reduced based on the actions that you've taken in the first half, how much labor costs will be reduced in the second half of the year.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we will continue because in the second part of the year, you will have the, let's say, the savings coming from our restructuring program getting into our cost structure. and as i was saying also, we think we can reduce the inefficiency that is coming into our cost of sale because of the very low level of production. by producing -- stopping production and reducing inventory, we have a very low level of absorption. this gradually, when we will align again production with sales, will also have an impact in reduction of our cost.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay. thank you. bye.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of simon toyne from redburn. your line is now open.
simon toyne -- redburn -- analyst
yeah, hi, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. just a couple, really building on some of the early questions. so first of all, on the competitive environment. you're talking about low single-digit ebitda margins in q3, albeit with some recovery in q4, you're kind of a leading producer in the industry. there must be a lot of pain across the broader supply base. i'm just interested in any sort of impressions you have of broader kind of developments in terms of capacity. and i guess, to the extent that any capacity is being forced out of this industry, is there any reason to assume it will permanently stay out even when prices recover?
and i guess kind of related to that, just the us itself. i mean it's been a focus of your investment in recent years through bay city [indecipherable]. there is considerable debate on whether shale activity will be structurally lower going forward, i guess, for a given oil price. just sort of interested in whether you agree with that? and what that kind of means for the footprint that you want to have in the us going forward?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, simon. well, you know, clearly, we didn't anticipate the pandemia and the impact on the oil demand worldwide and the collapse of investment in this. but still, in my view, in the us will continue to have a long-term energy industry. there will be strong, assuring energy supply to the country. and in this sense, the structure of our business and how we are positioned in bay city i think will fit with the medium-term recovery that we expect. but it is true that in this moment, in the us, you have a large stock of wells that has been drilled, waiting for completion and stock of octg on the ground.
now, completion will pick up faster. drilling will take time to recover because at first, the industry will need to complete the well, then to start drilling and the inventory in octg will also affect the demand. but over time, the positioning that tenaris had in the us is very strong. we will be able to produce our steel to have the most modern facility for pipe production between bay city, hickman and the other facility that we have. the structure and -- of the network of service center is strongest in my view among our competitor. so i think we are well positioned for this. i don't know if on this point, luca zanotti, you want to add on how you see the competitive environment and the position of tenaris for a recovery, how are we prepared for this?
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes, paolo. good morning. good morning, simon. now, here i believe that -- i have few points to add maybe on top of what paolo already said. you already touched on the oil supply or the energy supply as an issue of national security for the states. i believe that this is planted and it's going to stay. so in this perspective, the shales, longer-term, will certainly have space. now, it's going to be speculative to say now what space is going to be, but if you read any available report, it's clear that the unconventional in the united states, they are going to take their space again.
the industry in the states, the oil and gas industry, as already shown in the previous crisis, they were fast to adopt and they came out, and they come out strong. now, today, it's true, capital availability is lower. but we know because we talk with our customers and they are fighting. i mean they are not going to stay, sit and wait. so even this is encouraging for us.
and as far as tenaris specifically is concerned, i believe that, as paolo mentioned already, in a world that is going already a little bit less global, shortening the supply chain is going to be key. and all the investments that we have done are exactly aiming at that point. so i believe that the shale will have their pace, and we are very well positioned with all the assets that we deployed being these mills or service centers to supply to the industry.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, luca.
simon toyne -- redburn -- analyst
okay. great. thanks very much. i mean, maybe if i could just follow that. so on rig direct, i mean, you talk about the world becoming less global. i guess, the benefits to the customer of rig direct or even more or sort of heightened during a market downturn and there's an increased focus on costs and cash flow. i don't know if you could comment on the sort of pace of rollout of rig direct or whether you're seeing kind of an acceleration in the pace at which you're growing that as a share of your business during this downturn and what your expectations are, please.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, when i'm saying the world that is a little less global. i think that every country has an issue with energy security, for sure, and the united states. this gets in favor and you'll see this from many, many aspects concerning trade and concerning oil. i mean, the positioning of the countries on the global arena -- i think that energy continue to be a strategic component of the position of every country. we feel that we need to be present at the local level in all of the regions. this is valid for the large countries like us, but it's also valid for our position, for instance, in china or in middle east, which is very important, but also for countries like kazakhstan or nigeria or angola or a country in which we perceive activity will be there.
our strategy is to get straight to the client and manage the entire supply chain, build the client loyalty on the quality, on the service, on the integration of the supply chain, on minimizing the cost for the entire -- for the industry and the total cost of the operation based on better planning and reduction of inefficiency in the chain. we feel that in the long run, we will be successful to the extent to which we can contribute to the overall reduction of the cost of the activity worldwide. could it be offshore? could it be shales? could be locally in the countries that has potential for this.
i think that this is a very relevant component of the strategy of tenaris. and the crisis, to some extent, is validating this. this is the tool that we have today to allow us to stay close to a client. to be, to some extent, less affected by variation of the stock that could come from the intermediation distribution.
simon toyne -- redburn -- analyst
okay. thanks very much. i'll turn it over.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
rig direct is -- in this moment, it's very high in country like canada, in which we are above 90%. and luca, you can confirm in the -- let's say, the data of percentage of the rig direct in west, for instance.
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes. yes, paolo. yes, sorry, paolo, i didn't want to interrupt you. in the states -- yeah, yeah, yeah. in the states, this quarter, we reached the highest percentage in our sales of rig direct with a percentage, which is north of 85%. and just to complement on what paolo was saying, let's remember that the first phase of the rig direct development took place exactly in a crisis. because i believe that the industry is realizing that keeping the supply chain short is key to efficiency for us, for the players and for the e&ps as well.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of luigi de bellis from sim equita. your line is now open.
luigi de bellis -- equita sim -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. four questions for me. the first one is on the average selling price. could you elaborate about the mix in the coming quarters after the positive trend in second quarter? and where do you see average selling pricing entering in 2021? the second question on the cost savings. how much has been achieved in first half and how much remains for 2020? the third question on the outlook. could you give us an indication of volume pickup and profitability expected in q4 compared to q3? and the last question on the mexico. could you give us more details on the trend of registering than expected in the coming quarters in mexico? thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, luigi. on the first one, the average price, we expect that if we consider mix of product, mix of countries because this is a complex and the impact that we may have from a decline -- the last reduction in the [indecipherable] now that has also an influence. we may have, in the third q, a decline, a reduction in our realized price. and this -- let's say, you can consider that there will be a reduction in this for the third quarter and extending into the fourth quarter.
as far as the cost saving, i would say that we are probably realizing something in the range of 25% -- 25% -- 20% to 25% of our cost savings realized up to now in this quarter and we will continue to have the rest in the coming two quarters. as far as the ebitda or the margin expected, we mentioned this in the opening remark. today, we are anticipating that we should be able -- let's say, the ebitda should stay in the lower single digit in the next quarter, which will be the bottom in our view for our result as far as we can say.
and as far as the mexican evolution, let me -- in term of, let's say, sales, we had a reasonable quarter in the second q because of different product line for octg. this will be reduced in the next quarter, will be lower in the next quarter. but as far as the perspective of mexico, i would ask guillermo to give a quick view of what we can -- in our view, what we can expect, let's say, from the mexican part. yes, paolo. yes, paolo. thank you, luigi. how are you? and good morning, everybody. fine, thanks.
guillermo vogel -- vice chairman of the board
what we are seeing in mexico is that when the pandemic hit, it hit pemex, obviously. it hit pemex in terms of not only in the price of oil, but also in terms of the demand in mexico. so they announced a plan in order to face this situation, which included several factors like production and taxes that the government is asking pemex to pay. and they also announced a reduction in the capex of around 15% for e&p. and we saw a reduction already in the second quarter versus the first quarter, which was around the middle 20s -- 20% -- middle 20%. and we will -- we still are expecting a further reduction in the third quarter, probably another 10% reduction or so and then leveling off in the fourth quarter.
and we expect -- the president also announced that he wants to maintain the plan to increase production from the actual levels of around 1.6 [indecipherable] million barrels per day to 2.2 million barrels per day in 2024. so we expect next year to start to increase the activity of pemex but also this will be strengthened in moving forward by the coming in of the different projects that were granted under the [indecipherable] during the previous administration, which are going to be respected and they're moving forward. so we see -- we saw a third quarter a little bit below the second quarter in pemex leveling off. and then what we're seeing is coming back to a stronger activity starting the first quarter of next year.
luigi de bellis -- equita sim -- analyst
thank you very much.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, guillermo, and thank you, luigi. i think we covered the four points that you made, no?
luigi de bellis -- equita sim -- analyst
yes. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. yes. maybe luigi, just to clarify, when i was referring to cost, i'm referring to the structural cost, to a fixed cost now because the cost of sales is also influenced by the sub-absorption due to the lower level of production. this is something different.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of amy wong from ubs. your line is now open.
amy wong -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. just a couple of questions from me, please. the first one relates to your middle east and africa sales, which were very resilient during the quarter. just some color on how long that order book stretches out for would be very, very helpful. and the second question relates to -- i think you covered it a little bit on your rig direct response in the us take up very high. but i'd love to just get a sense of -- an update on how ipsco is integrating within your north america operations, what the client response so far are, are any -- are your clients smoothly transitioning on to the tenaris platform. just any color around that would be very helpful as well. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, amy. well, on the middle east, you're right. we had a very good quarter in the second quarter -- a good quarter. but i would ask gabriel to give you an overview on the middle eastern perspective.
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
thank you, paolo. good morning, amy. indeed, we had a resilient quarter in the middle east. this is where the -- we see some strength in the order book with a good perspective for the next few months. clearly, this is an area where the lifting costs are lower and the nocs are financially strong to sustain the operations. so we see that the nocs in uae, saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, the core of the gcc have adjusted the drilling activity in the range of 10% to 20%, and they have made decisions to delay projects related with high capex and new infrastructure. so we expect in the next quarter solid sales, given the important long-term positions we hold in these countries and the positive success rate we had on the limited tendering that has come to market this year.
outside the middle east, the situation is a bit more complex. there is, as you know, an aggressive stance of iocs to reduce capex. so this will translate into slowdown of drilling and purchasing activities. this is -- you mentioned about africa, this is one of the areas that is going to be mostly impacted. we have a very good and strong first half even with pipeline sales, in west africa, that this will not repeat in the remainder of the year. we also had a strong caspian sales in the first semester. this will also slow down. so the resilience outside the middle east is much less. and in asia pacific, just to complete all the regions, will follow a milder slowdown as our premium sales related to gas applications in china will be less affected.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, gabriel. now on the rig direct integration of ipsco. at this point in time, we are no longer considering ipsco as a separate entity. we are, let's say, moving in a very integrated way and the crisis has acted in this direction. but luca, maybe you can comment on how we are managing the integration and at which point are we.
luca zanotti -- president, usa
thank you, paolo. good morning, amy. now operations-wise, we are fully integrated in the plants where we're doing this relevant, being threading facility or, for example, we are investing, as you said before, koppel. but just to give a flavor, today, we are able to thread all former ipsco property technology in our plants. so as you correctly said, we are fully integrated. and as a consequence, we tend to see ourselves to a new customer base. now, with this crisis, of course, it's very difficult to assess where we stand in tests because let's remember that the demand dropped.
what we see very interesting is that our connections are especially developed for the shale applications. the new ones are being very, very successful. and this is one of the drivers that will help us moving forward in the, let's say, short-term period. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, luca. but by the way, we had some clients that we are getting thanks to the value of the [indecipherable] joined that we get from ipsco. so we -- integration is, i think, is working at every level, but in a situation in which really the market is at a very bare minimum of operation.
amy wong -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
that's very helpful color. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of blake gendron from wolfe research. your line is now open.
blake geelhoed gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks for getting me on here and taking the questions. just wanted to follow-up on your comments about the cost absorption and cost of goods sold specifically. you do break out cost of goods sold by line item. i'm just wondering if you can give us a feel for what percentage of cost of goods sold is fixed versus variable currently post some of your structural changes to the cost structure, what it was like before the pandemic and where do you think it goes to in a more normalized environment, i.e., how would volume have to recover before you added back additional fixed costs? thanks.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, thank you, blake. i was mentioning the absorption. alicia, you can give a broad view because this is changing, obviously, depending quarter-for-quarter. in broad term, which is, i mean, referring the report we reviewed yesterday.
alicia mondolo -- chief financial officer
yes. if you see this in some stable situation, if you are looking for our cost of sales, we can say that we have -- 35% of this are fixed and 65% of this -- of the sale costs will be variable. but if we see our fixed cost at this moment, we can consider that the percentage of fixed cost is around 70% and 30% are variable. but this is without taking into account our saving cost plan. so if we are looking for the [indecipherable] we can say that, but we are in place with our restructuring plan cost.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, because you know this -- we are acting on this that we -- it's not exactly fixed because we have suspension plan, we have -- different tools there in the different region could be utilized to reduce the cost of, let's say, idle labor differently. but i think this is giving you a reference.
blake geelhoed gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
no. that's very helpful. thank you. and one more follow-up, if i could. we talk a lot about unconventional gas in the middle east, gas development broadly for domestic consumption in different parts of the world. enriching on the octg front, but i'm wondering if there's an infrastructure opportunity over the longer term? and then if you look offshore mediterranean, it looks like assets may change hands here in the near-term and potentially down the road some development plans offshore for gas. how do you view the line pipe market today and what do you think are going to be the opportunities for large infrastructure projects moving forward?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, maybe i will ask gabriel to respond to it. gas is essential our for operations -- for our market in the middle east, in china and eastern mediterranean and everywhere. but in my view, there will be some delay in many of the large projects. i do not see many large infrastructural projects for gas. there will come to a final investment decision very soon. but gabriel, you may expand on basically the western -- on the eastern hemisphere, no?
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
thank you, paolo. yes, indeed, there is a promising future for gas. we see gas increasing its share in the energy matrix, driven by domestic gas consumption increase of demand. this is very noticeable in many of the countries in the middle east that we are talking about. and many of our sales are related to domestic gas developments. we see that in china and in other areas of the world. and then the export of gas, the lng is expected to continue to grow.
as paolo said, given the current environment, we don't expect large infrastructure projects of fids, like, for example, the one that we're expecting in mozambique or in papua new guinea to happen in the short term, but it -- they are a midterm project that at some point in time will come on stream. and gas developments typically require more complex connections, more complex grades. so in the midterm -- in the long-term, when this gets developed, this will be -- continue to be a positive trend within the energy matrix in the next few years.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, gabriel. because -- just to add, we have, for instance, in latin america, important project in infrastructure for gas in brazil, argentina, mexico also. but i do not think that we will see anytime soon final investment decision. this is a difficult moment for all of the economies in the region.
blake geelhoed gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. thank you for the detail.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alejandro demichelis from nau securities. your line is now open.
alejandro demichelis -- nau securities limited -- analyst
yeah. good morning, paolo, gentlemen. a couple of questions. the first one is just to follow-up on the ipsco situation. because i think in your report, it says that ipsco has had a minor contribution to tenaris' margins. so i'm trying to understand that although you have integrated ipsco, that that's not a loss-making operation, that that has still some kind of level of a positive margin, even if it is small. that's the first question. and then the second question is on your master distribution agreement with tmk. i understand that there has been some renegotiation on the penalties. but could you please give us some indication of how you see those penalties kind of evolving if you don't reach the minimum levels?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, alejandro. on the two points, as i mentioned before, today would be difficult for us to isolate the contribution of ipsco because we are really managing at this point in time everything as a single unit, especially in the crisis. i mean, this is a situation in which the reduction in our sales has been so sudden and so deep that everything is managed at this point in a combined way. and the room also for the tmk import agreement for a distribution agreement is also reduced by this. that's the reason why it is being negotiated. but maybe luca could add some color on this that i'm saying. luca?
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes, paolo. good morning, alejandro. no, not much because i believe that you've been pretty complete. but in general terms, we are treating any ipsco customer that we inherited with the acquisition as a tenaris customer. so in this respect, it's really not possible for us to isolate. and in terms of the master distribution agreement, of course, the master distribution agreement foresees the purchase of a certain number that given the circumstances, has been renegotiated and made fit to the current market conditions.
alejandro demichelis -- nau securities limited -- analyst
so just to confirm, we should not expect a penalty coming from that master distribution agreement?
luca zanotti -- president, usa
no.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we do not expect this because we just adjusted considering the reduction in the market is logical from both parties because also [indecipherable] are very -- are looking very carefully at the import level into the united states in a moment that is such a difficult moment for the domestic producer. so this has been -- i mean, adjustment of a contract to a change of circumstances that is very clear and very certain.
alejandro demichelis -- nau securities limited -- analyst

2020-Q3,TS,2020-11-06 22:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q3 2020 tenaris earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations
thank you, gigi, and welcome to tenaris 2020 third quarter results conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in the call, and that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during this call.
with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations.
before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment on results. our third quarter sales at $1 billion were down 43% compared to the corresponding quarter of last year and 18% sequentially, as drilling activity in the u.s. and the rest of the world continued to decline. our sales were also affected by a 9% decline in our tubes average selling prices, as we did not repeat the exceptional mix of products sold during the second quarter. despite this further reduction in sales, our ebitda for the quarter, which includes $28 million of severance charges, was up 83% sequentially to $107 million, reflecting an excellent industrial performance and the progress we are making with our structural cost reduction plan.
our ebitda margin recovered to around 11%. excluding severance charges, our ebitda in the quarter would have been at $135 million, with a margin of 13%. during the quarter, we generated a free cash flow of $376 million or 37% of our revenues. the free cash flow included a further decline in working capital of $333 million, and we ended up the quarter with a net cash position of $1.1 billion. the board of directors has decided to approve a dividend repayment -- interim dividend payment of $0.07 per share or $0.14 per adr to be paid on november 25.
now, i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni, and good morning to all of you. in this quarter -- in this third quarter, we achieved good results considering the circumstances. the decline in our volume and sales was less than expected in several regions and we were able to comply fully with customer requirements despite the ongoing impact of the pandemia and government measure to contain it. we have been able to operate effectively and our customer maintained continuity in their operation. we've been very efficient in our industrial operations during the quarter despite of the low level of production, and we made good progress on our programs to reduce structural costs and inventories. this has been and continue to be a very difficult time for our employees. they are showing great resilience, and it is thanks to their commitment and effort that we were able to obtain these results.
our communities have also been affected, but it gave us an outstanding support all along this period. during this time, we have deployed $6 million fund, which has been helpful in supporting local health and education system that has been under severe stress. we continue to advance with our strategic agenda. in china, we have established a joint venture with state-owned baogang baotou steel, a large integrated steelmaker in inner mongolia, with more than seamless pipe making facilities, supplying casing and tubing to china's onshore oil and gas field. the joint venture, in which we have a 60% shareholding, we'll install a premium trading facility with an initial annual capacity of 40,000 tons to trade tenarishydril premium connection on baogang pipes. the new facility is expected to start operation at the end of 2021. through this joint venture, we expect to expand our presence in china onshore oil and gas industry, as it increases investment in gas drilling, complementing our existing operation at qingdao.
in canada, we closed down our prudential mill in calgary, and we will consolidate production of seamless, welded and premium products in sault ste. marie with an investment of $72 million. this repositioning of our industrial activities, which will be completed by november 2021, will strengthen our competitiveness and increase our domestic production capabilities for the canadian market.
facing the challenges of the energy transition, the oil and gas industry is consolidating, starting in north america. many of our long-term customers are leading these consolidations. we see these as a positive trend, which will strengthen the scope of our relation with these customers and augment the value we bring through digital integration, technical service and close attention to health and safety and environment through the tubular supply chain.
we are positioning ourselves in the new energy segment associated with the energy transition. although our sale for green energy application are marginal today, they will increase over time. we are actively participating in many of the larger projects for building the new infrastructure for hydrogen mobility, a supplier of large, high-pressure vessel for hydrogen filling stations, particularly in europe and california. among this, we are supplying gas cylinders as part of the project to decarbonize the port of los angeles by increasing the use of hydrogen zero-remission fuel cell trucks. and in europe, we are supporting pilot deployments in germany, netherlands, denmark, france and austria, as a partner to the main players involved in setting up the infrastructure of hydrogen refueling stations.
we are advancing with systematic efforts worldwide to reduce inventories and lead time to support our rig direct operation. to achieve this, we are increasing the use of digital technology throughout our supply chain operation. this is contributing to a more efficient use of working capital, and have strengthened our free cash flow generation over the past quarters. in the year-to-date, our free cash flow has amounted to $1.2 billion, or 31% of invoicing. looking forward, we expect to continue reducing our level of inventories, although not to the same extent as the past two quarters, and maintain a positive free cash flow. given these results, our board of directors decided that the company will make an interim dividend payment later this month.
over the past week, a second wave of pandemic infection has struck europe and the united states, which is likely to slow down the recovery in the global economy and oil consumption as well as in investment in oil and gas drilling activity. we do, however, think that this third quarter represent the bottom in terms of our volume and sales, and then we will see a gradual improvement in our sales and margin in the fourth quarter and going into 2021, as we continue to implement our plan for structural cost reduction. as we prepare for a gradual market recovery, tenaris remains focused on improving its competitiveness and strengthening its market position all around the world.
we are prepared now to take any question you may have in the call.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sean meakim from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you. hey, good morning.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, sean.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so, just wanted to spend more time on the margin improvement. last quarter, we were coming into 3q thinking that would be the bottom. instead, you're able to improve margins over 400 basis points, considering what the activity world looks like. very impressive. and so as we think about the change from 2q to 3q, could we unpack some of the moving parts and maybe some drags in the second quarter that didn't recur in the third quarter? and maybe just to reaffirm your expectation that this is still a bottom for margins as you said, fourth quarter and '21 should be higher off of this point. would love to just maybe understand those moving pieces including the cost-out program that you're undertaking. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sean. as you were saying, in fact, our margin improved even beyond what was our original expectation. i would say that there are three points here. on one side, the -- we were anticipating some more relevant impact on covid contagious in the country in which we operate and with our clients. we anticipate some disruption in our ability to manage in that facility and some disruption also in the activity of our client. but in fact, this didn't happen to the extent to which -- that we were considering for our original projections.
the second point is the execution of our cost reduction plan, and the efficiency with which our industrial operation works. we achieve target in improving efficiency almost in all of our facility. and at the same time, we executed pretty well our plans for cost reduction and containment of cost of our idle people. because in the end, even today, we continue to have part of our workforce that is either suspended or out of the plant for reason related to the covid. so we -- the containment of cost and the efficiency of operation has been probably the key for the increase in margin that we saw in the third quarter.
and the last point has been demand. we've been having some additional demand, not in the united states, which behave more or less in line with our forecast, but in some other markets, in latin american market and in other markets in which we had some additional volume compared to our original expectation. there has been no extraordinary charges or benefit in this period. i mean, between the second and the third q. this is business, as usual, no specific -- no particular extraordinary expenditure apart from the cost of the initiation [phonetic] and reducing our people, and as you can see in the impairment; the impairment of the prudential facility that we decided to close. these are what the, i would say, the extraordinary elements in our results.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
that's very helpful. and again, just a really impressive result in terms of execution. one other piece to maybe get your feedback on as we think about the influences on margins would be the impact of input costs versus pricing for your products. maybe you could just give us a little more insight into what's happening with your raw input cost on steel, etc., versus what's happening with pipe logix's pricing, still pretty challenged, and how you've been able to kind of overcome some of those impacts on your margin progression?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, on this, we are seeing an increase in prices for iron ore, hot rolled coils and other input in our system. but during this month, we streamlined very much our inventories and our supply chain. so in the end, we are using, to a large extent, the inventory that we had inside. and so the new pricing is getting into our cost of sale very slowly and will continue to do so for a while. i mean, we are reducing purchasing and we are streamlining all of the inventory in the chain; from inventory of raw material to the inventory of work in process, to the inventory ready for delivery material. so we are not seeing this as a main factor in this quarter, and we shouldn't see this in the coming two quarters. probably, this will have an impact later on if the volume increase and our production level goes up gradually. it will increase in this quarter. it will do so also in the coming quarter.
as far as pricing is concerned, you have seen that the pipe logix started to move up, because the industry is reflecting the cost of raw material into the pricing. and this, in our view, should continue. the increase in the value of hot rolled coils in the united states has been very substantial. and so this will gradually -- should gradually translate into overall increase in pricing starting in north america, and we will see for the rest of the world.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
right. that makes lot of sense. again, very well done. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sean.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ian macpherson from simmons. your line is now open.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
thank you, paolo. and also, congratulations, much better than we had expected on the quarter and the outlook. i thought that we were maybe expecting third quarter revenues to be down as much as 30%. they obviously fell by less than 20%. do you think that there was -- obviously, you spoke the economic impact in the quarter from covid disruption, said it was a little bit less bad than you had expected. but when we look at what rig count did and the headline decline in pricing, it looks like you either grew your market share or maybe benefited from restocking. and i wonder if you have a view on those two elements as they set into q3. and then my other question, i just wanted to see if you might give us a little more specifics on the fourth quarter trajectory with regard to the -- how much improvement you expect for revenue as well as ebitda in the fourth quarter? thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ian, and thank you for your appreciation. well, the -- you are perfectly right. we were expecting a reduction in our sale in the range of 30%. in the end, we ended up with something even lower than 20%. and this is the point that i made in the first question. i mean, there's been much less disruption in operation due to covid than we were anticipating. but in some markets, we had some reaction, for instance, argentina. in spite of the difficulties in the economic situation of argentina, rig count in argentina went up to 25 rigs. we were close to zero before. so there has been some positive sign there. and also some increasing market share. the -- our rig direct model gave us some advantage, i think, it has been in the united states, and we have been able probably to increase, to some extent, our market share. this -- the combined effect of this resulted in higher sales.
for the 4q, we expect to be able to increase sales again marginally, not something substantial, because the industry is recovering very slowly. but if you look at the rig count in the united states, rig count went up from 246. it went up to close to 300. so there has been a reaction. there is a reaction in the market and we should be able, in the 4q, to have an increase in our sales. and accordingly, also to preserve our cost efficiency, hopefully, we have no drawback on this. so we should be able to increase also gradually our margin.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
okay. so no specifics, but what you're saying is a very moderate increases on both points?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. there is no, let's say, relevant single market action in this -- in the fourth quarter. there are changes in the landscape or there is some uncertainty deriving from the different issue, including the u.s. election, so that could have an impact on some decision of stocking or not stocking by the companies.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi from cowen. your line is now open.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
thank you. again, impressive results. and i guess the question that a lot of people have with the cost reductions that you were able to achieve is how much of that is truly structural? it sounds like there isn't much cost coming back in the fourth quarter, but as we talk about increasing activity throughout '21, i'd be curious to hear how much you think of the cost savings that you've been able to achieve are truly permanent.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, marc. i think we implemented a number of actions to reduce cost that will stay for the future, will not be, let's say -- we will not be getting back on this cost reduction. there has been reduction of headcount in some region, concentration of operation in the more efficient facility in some other. and there is one factor. that is the absorption that should play in our favor because level of operation, the level of production will be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. so this will result in a better absorption in the lower cost, is a factor that will help us and may help us also in the beginning of 2021. so i think we -- the cost saving that we achieved are there and there will be some additional cost reduction due to the better absorption.
on top of this, our plan, we advanced on our plan. we implemented a large part of it, but we still consider that there is 20% of our reduction plan and streamlining plan that needs to be implemented. there are medium-term actions, like the concentration in canada, the operation in one mill. these are actions that are relevant in the medium term, will have an impact on the long term. but there are also actions that we are taking on -- that will have an impact in the coming two, three quarters that, in our view, will contribute to further reduction in cost.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
paolo, is the -- the target previously was $220 million by the end of the year, and it would appear that you're over and above that here in the third quarter. maybe i've got that wrong, but it appears the target is above the $220 million now. can you comment on what that new target might be? and as you mentioned, there's maybe 20% remaining. what would that be in dollar terms?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the target was the direct target in our fixed structure, but then there are savings that we have been able to achieve and the reduction of third-party contract reduction in the variable cost to do better absorptions. so on top of what we are reducing in our structure, that is more or less in line with what you're saying. i think we achieve maybe something more than the number you're seeing, because there are also factors like the exchange rate in the region in which we operate that is adding to the reduction we were planning at the beginning. but on top of this, there is, i think, the reduction that we are getting from other sources, including the better absorption. and so we ended up with the number -- grew to the number that you are mentioning.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
yeah. okay, thanks very much. i will turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tom zhang from credit suisse. your line is now open.
tom zhang -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. hi, gents. thanks very much for taking my questions. i've got two, and i'll take them one by one, if that's ok? first, just on product mix. i mean, you guys mentioned in q2, there would be a negative mix effect into q3. and at that point, you said it would extend into q4. is that still the case? do you see a weaker mix going into the next quarter? and, yeah, i'll stop there.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we confirm what we are saying. there has been a change in pricing due to the mix, and we expect this to remain. when we talk about the product mix, we're also considering the different region, different product. and so it's a combination -- the mix a combination of many different factors. and we expect that in the fourth quarter we will maintain the mix of region and product that were similar, i mean, to what we have in the third q. there is no major change. it's not that we had some specific change of region. it's a smooth change between region and between product. and this is driving the pricing.
tom zhang -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. very clear. and just a second question on the containment of the costs. could you remind us if any of that is linked to government aid schemes, for example, in italy or in europe? and what the outlook is on how long those are kept for? so any government aid for the cost savings?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we -- i would say that there is no specific program beside the cassa integrazione in italy, the covid cassa integrazione. there has been a scheme to support either people in italy during the difficult months. this will go on. now the last decree, i think, is announcing that the cassa integrazione will be extended until march in italy. this is a factor that helps us to support the cost to hire the people, it's not to reducing to zero, but it's helping. in the other region, there are some actions to reduce the cost, but for instance, we have none of this in argentina. and what we have done, we negotiated with the union suspension agreement that allow us to operate and keep the other people with some reduction in cost for the company, and no specific major program in other countries.
tom zhang -- credit suisse -- analyst
just with italy, would you be able to share roughly what percentage of staff would be on that integrazione policy?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i can tell you, i give you a figure as a whole. in this moment, we have roughly 20% of our overall workforce idle under different scheme. part of this population, not only in italy, overall in the country. in italy, in this moment, in this month, production is relatively high, because we have some pipeline under way in this moment. so the use of cassa integrazione is reduced to a minimum in this period. we have almost -- it has been more important in the third q, but not now.
tom zhang -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. thank you. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david anderson from barclays. your line is now open.
j. david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning. i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the inventory levels in the broader united states. i think in the last we talked, in the last quarter, i think it was something in the neighborhood of about 14 months or so. i was wondering if you could give us an update there. and i know the lower 40 rig count has picked up a bit, but it looks like you said mostly private operators. i'm just wondering, in your mind, do you need to see the bigger e&ps and the majors really start to resume drilling before this can start to work down? thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, david. i think the inventory, to some extent, start -- the inventory in the ground start to go down. but i will ask luca zanotti to comment on this.
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes. thanks you, paolo. good morning, dave, good morning, everybody.yes, as far as your first question, dave, on the inventory, we see inventory coming down. now we are in the range of 11 months as we speak. and we see some item being in a relative scarcity. and in terms of mix of operators that are improving, yes, you're right. what we see now are smaller, relatively smaller private operator that are adding rigs. and then we need to see if the bigger guy will start to play in the future. and we'll maintain the growth that we are seeing today.
j. david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. and paolo, you had talked about an opportunity in china with the jv of the threading mill. china has been not really an area where you've looked at very closely in the past. i think you've tried to stay with some commoditized asian markets. can you just talk about this? are you sort of dipping your toe in the market to sort of see if this is an area you want to get bigger in? i'm just curious kind of what your kind of broader strategic views are on that asian market?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. well, our strategy for china has been, since long, to supply the more demanding segment in the market. so the project, there are more complex project that require complex product. so to focus on this segment. we were operating there from qingdao, it's not only oil and gas, in qingdao, we are also manufacturing pieces for the automotive business. i mean, it's an industrial center that is producing specialty products for the oil industry for the more complex project, but also for automotive.
now we proceed in this strategy, because in the agreement with baogang, we will establish a premium facility in inner mongolia, that will have access to complex projects for cnooc and cnpc in china. we invest in china for china. and for the segment on which we can have margins that are interesting and differentiation for this. but we feel that we need also to combine supply of our pipes from -- coming from different cities in the world with a component of pipes produced locally. this will position ourself where we want to be in china. we will never be, and we're not planning to be a massive producer in china or to produce in china for export. we are planning to focus on the complex product niche.
j. david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
makes sense. thank you for the clarification.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of igor levi from btig. your line is now open.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
hi guys. could you provide an update on the ipsco integration? and have you started to regain market share that ipsco lost during the process of the transaction?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, igor. i will pass this to luca. but let me comment, just one general comment. there is a consolidation under way in the united states, and you have seen this, oil companies are consolidating. and as i was saying in the opening remark, this is a very important transformation. that in our view, it favor our positioning in the states.
but luca, you can comment on, let's say, the setup of tenaris plus ipsco in this market.
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes. thank you, paolo. good morning, igor. as i get opportunity to say over the last conference call as well, our integration with ipsco is completed. i mean, we are managing everything as a system, and at this stage, there is no more ipsco for us. the only piece that still needs to be completed is the investment in our steel shop facilities up in koppel. that's going to come online in april, may 2021. but this is the last -- let's say, the last piece, is under way. we're going to get it done according to plans.
and of course, i mean, as paolo was saying, there is a consolidation; and second, we are start seeing the benefits expected from the internal integration coming in into our revenues as well. so again, we are managing this as a system, and we are heading where we were supposed to go.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, luca. but the point that i think is relevant is in the u.s., the operators that are consolidating the con of prior year, they are moving on to favorite. our clients with whom we work very well, they are demanding for product, for quality, for delivery, for service, for technical sales. they like long-term relation. and so in this consolidation, our proposal for the rig direct, our long-term relation also on a much wider scale, because there are client that we also serve everywhere in the world. in our view, we're always us a competitive advantage. we feel that we will be well positioned in the ipsco acquisition, giving us also the steel shop capability in koppel, plus expanding our product range with some technology that is relevant for the shales should be a good fit.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and another question i had is on your entry into the hydrogen space, and how your experience, the technology related to your existing business will give you an advantage to secure market share as hydrogen gains traction as a transportation fuel?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, this is just at the beginning. hydrogen carbon capture and storage technology, geothermal, i mean there is a number of application that requires large infrastructure. imagine that if the world move, for instance, in fuel cells for truck transportation into a more extended use of hydrogen, then there will be an infrastructure that needs to be built. the infrastructure that require pipes, that require vessels.
hydrogen has a relatively low energy content by volume. so in the end, needs extreme pressure. so we will need to operate vessels with very high pressure exposed to risk of brittle, frac in the steel. so these are technology that we develop in our -- for the oil and gas industry. it could be applied to the deployment of product that are aimed for this infrastructure.
today, this is still very limited. but to the extent to which the world move on this energy transition in a much more active way, the world needs to set up the infrastructure for this. we will have, let's say, a segment that will be growing fast and is growing fast. in this segment, i mean, year-on-year, we are continuously growing. still, this technology is transforming the main -- the governments should take the decision on the infrastructure support and so.
but we will see. we need to be present to develop the product to assure the client that they can solve technical problem of our product and co2 transportation pressure and so is demanding, hydrogen pressure are high. so the steel we are developing for this may be useful for expanding our share in this segment.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nick konstantakis from exane. your line is now open.
nick konstantakis -- exane -- analyst
hi guys, and thank you for taking my question. i mean, i'm asking if you look at your crystal ball and i appreciate there's a lot of uncertainties given covid, but as some of the u.s. services companies are taking, the industry is talking about a more meaningful recovery in the rig count in the u.s. potentially in the second half. i mean you touched a bit on the inventory -- or inventory overhang situation at the moment. but how do we think at the point in 2021 that you start, your sales start picking up meaningfully as well? could that potentially lag the rig count? are we going to see slightly ahead of that? what are your thoughts around the potential timing on that?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, what we know is that this level of rig operation will not be enough to assure continuity of oil production in the states at the level of 11 million barrel a day. i mean, what we know is that in some moment, the inventory of drill, uncompleted well will go down, the level of rigs should come up just to support the level of operation in the states that allow level of production in the range of 10 million to 11 million barrel a day. so rigs will go up, in my view.
now the question of timing is influenced by covid, and could be also influenced by political decision. let me ask luca if, in his view, the scenario of a gradual increase is the one that we see for -- during 2021.
luca zanotti -- president, usa
yes, paolo, thank you. no, i believe i don't have much to add to your explanation. of course, there are uncertainties, but as we saw, there is a number of taxes that are coming down and they are able to sustain a little production into 2021. but longer term, according to all the analysis that we see, we should have a rig pickup in order to sustain the production level in the levels that you said. so i'm fully aligned what you said.
now the timing will depend on how the month pickups more than -- whether or not it's going to happen. so in our opinion, it's a matter of time, but we're going to see a recovery in rig count in the u.s.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, luca.
nick konstantakis -- exane -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of connor lynagh from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thanks. i was wondering if we could discuss the capacity closure in canada, where that much of your capacity is idled at the moment. but what sort of drove the decision to permanently close capacity there? and if we remain in a relatively similar, i think, improving somewhat, but not going substantially higher environment, should we think about more capacity closures from you? or do you feel good with where your capacity is right now?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, connor. the decision in canada is driven by the need to streamline our industrial operation. we had in canada basically three facility and an extensive network of yards and service point. but to keep two facilities, one in sault ste. marie, the other one in calgary in this condition is adding to our fixed cost.
and by moving, because what we are doing, basically, we are moving production of welded product also to sault ste. marie, revamping the [indecipherable] so to make it -- to transform it into very high state-of-the-art performance facility, streamlining the layout in a way that we have high productivity. and installing into space that we have in algomatubes, distributing fixed cost, maintenance costs and so in one facility. and keeping this q4, our other facility for accessory and sometimes other production in alberta still operative.
we should be able to reduce our cost. and at the same time, we are bringing the facility closer to the major source of hot rolled coils. algomatubes -- the plants that are operating in the eastern part of canada. so in our view, we are saving -- from a production point of view, we are saving our structural point.
we are updating the technology, and we are improving on logistics. that makes sense for a market in which our share is increasing, our rig direct is very high, it's above 93%, 95%. and we are very keen in strengthening our position in canada. so more than a closure of capacity is a repositioning of capacity in a different setup that we expect to be more efficient, more aggressive, more competitive.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. got it. that's helpful. i guess we discussed this briefly earlier in just regards to china, but it seems like you guys have had some niche opportunities in russia, saudi arabia, now china. are there any other markets that you feel you can sort of take advantage of current market conditions and increase your foothold or otherwise expand your capacity? is there anything we should be watching out for on that front over the next couple of years here?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well you know you mentioned some of this. but i would ask gabriel to give a brief view of the move from an industrial and commercial point of view, and our deployment in the eastern hemisphere, because it's pretty large. our footprint is pretty impressive in all of the region.
gabriel?
gabriel casanova -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. thank you, paolo, and connor, for your question.
indeed, our footprint in the eastern hemisphere is pretty large. we mentioned today that announcement of the new jv in china that would complement our positioning build over our facility in qingdao. we talked in the past about russia, right now slowing down a bit deployment of that project on siberia, but pretty much committed to go ahead and create some inroads complementing the niche strategy that we have had so far in russia.
the middle east is one of the most resilient areas. clearly, we see that the rig count in general in this area this year, a lot of markets involved but have gone down about 30% versus pre-covid levels. and the core middle east, like uae, saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, activity has reduced much less, i would say, in the range of 15% to 20%. so these are areas where we have position. we have manufacturing in saudi arabia.
we have recently completed in this quarter the new service center in uae, as we prepare for the increase of the rig direct deployment that we will have here in abu dhabi. and later next year, we are also going to be deploying our new trading facility for premium connections in uae. so these are some of the areas that we are seeing.
some other areas have been impacted much more that have been important for us in the past. iraq, for example, is an area where the rig count has plummeted, about 60%. this has been a supportive engine for tenaris during 2020. but unfortunately, the pace of shipments will go down into 2021.
also, kazakhstan is an era that we mentioned before. we had an uncertainty in first half of 2020. but due to the new policies and reductions of rigs as well, our facility that we have in aktau in kazakhstan, where local content is very important, will be operating at low level of activity for the next few months.
so we are looking at opportunities. clearly, with the downturn, opportunities appear. we are pretty much present in every basin in the north sea, in sub-saharan africa, we have service centers in ghana, we have operating coating facilities in nigeria, trading in nigeria as well. so we are pretty much having a global unmatched presence and ready to take on opportunities. i will not disclose much further.
the only thing that i'm going to say that the cycles in this part of the world are a bit slower than what we've seen than, for example, in the faster pace of north america, either up or down. so for now, we have been having some resilience in the shipments. we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter, especially for the middle east. but naturally, as the new rig count levels, and the backlog adjust to the new activity levels, we will see a slowdown into the early 2021.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, gabriel. you were asking if we are moving in with our footprint down the chain. well, in some markets like, for instance, in argentina, we are now performing coil tube service. i mean we look for opportunity to enhance our service component. and in some case, we have pilot in understanding how this could be done or could be included in our supply chain in a very effective way.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alessandro pozzi from mediobanca. your line is now open.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
hi there. thank you for taking my questions. i have two.
the first one is on cash flow. i think for me, the surprising fact was that probably the free cash flow was positive even before the working capital, putting the acquisition aside. i think that was possible also because the capex had come down quite a lot. and i was wondering, as we go into 2021, what sort of capex do you see is just a bare minimum maintenance capex. do you expect to make a few more investments? and as a result, any view on what the free cash flow may be in 2021? also because i think we're going to see a working capital build next year.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, alessandro. well, the cash flow, as you are seeing, has been very positive in these quarters because of the reduction in inventory. we will continue to reduce inventory, because we are in the -- we are introducing changes in the way we program and the digitalization of our chain. so there is a structural change in the lead time and the level of inventory that we think we need for a defined level of operation. so the digitalization of the chain should give us a reduction of lead time over time. so we will continue on stock reduction at a lower pace, because when the production increases, we inevitably have to increase to some extent.
in terms of capex, this year, we will be spending around $200 million as a whole in 2020. we think that still in 2021, the overall expenditure will stay in the range of $160 million to $170 million. so slightly lower than in 2020, without considering special project or some that's good. but including the canada -- the rig position in canada and in china, but without any other, let's say, move outside. obviously, this is the cash flow before dividend.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
yes. so we shouldn't expect any build in working capital, let's say, in q1 and q2 next year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. if let's say, to a lower level, but we will have some additional cash flow coming from the working capital.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay. perfect. and my second question is on q4. what sort of level of severance charges do you expect, if any, in q4? and what could be the improvement in ebitda margin in going to q4?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, in q4, we will have still severance expenses in the range of $30 million. there will be a charge for severance experience in 4q. without this, on the term of adjusted ebitda, we will be in the middle teens. this is what we expected for the fourth quarter.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, alessandro.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of frank mcgann from bank of america. your line is now open.
frank mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. typically, in periods like this, you have been able to augment your portfolio, and i know you've just announced the mongolia plant. but looking at acquisitions, i was just wondering, obviously, you've just incorporated ipsco as well. but are there other assets that you would look at in this kind of environment, given the strength of your balance sheet and perhaps some distressed assets that might be available at attractive prices?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we are always considering strategic options that we can. what we know here is that the industry in case of a long-term energy transition, our client will consolidate. will redefine the way they operate. they will react to this, and you know this very well. also, the service industry is doing this. you see the movement that different companies are taking. and we feel that we also have to look around, keep full financial strength, i think we can leverage on our financial strength, to understand how to position the company strategically for the long run. in this process of energy transition, we have to consider different options. and we will be -- i mean, our financial position give us degree of leverage, freedom to consider strategic deployment through acquisition or expansion, that will position us as a clear leader in our industry for the future.
frank mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. if i could follow up also, just in terms of ebitda margins, following up on the last question or caller. if you're in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, as you're looking out toward 2021, i think there have been some expectation that 2021 would remain challenging given that you're starting from a lower base in the second half than the higher base that you had in the first half of 2020, particularly the first quarter, are you thinking now that 2021 could be a stronger year, potentially than 2020 given the pickup you expect in some markets?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, as i was mentioning, we expect our margin to increase slowly, we will preserve our cost reduction actions on this. it will depend from the dynamics of the market, but this is our view, that this will be recovering slowly even during the first half of 2021.
frank mcgann -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kevin roger from kepler cheuvreux. your line is now open.
kevin roger -- kepler cheuvreux -- analyst
yes. good evening everyone. thanks for taking the question. just one for me, it's related to basically your cash pile. so you have $1.1 billion of cash in hands right now. you expect to be free cash flow positive in the coming quarters. so i was wondering what's your mindset in the use of this cash pile. how do you consider this cash? do you want to keep a minimum level of cash? do you want to increase the return to shareholders? but what's your mindset on this cash pile, please?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we have a long-term view for tenaris. we're always considering the relation with our shareholder, the strategic positioning of the company on the long run in the energy transition. so the net -- the financial position of tenaris is a very strong competitive advantage in this long-term vision and planning for the company. there could be opportunity that comes out, there is a chance, i mean we can maintain a stable predictable relation with our shareholder. and we can also face, let's say -- address opportunity or face risk, if any. so this is the criteria that i think the board and shareholder is adopting in defining priorities for the long-term development of the company.
kevin roger -- kepler cheuvreux -- analyst
okay. understood. thanks.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the tenaris s.a. fourth quarter and full year 2020 results conference call. [operator instructions] [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna. please go ahead, sir.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
thank you, gigi, and welcome to tenaris 2020 fourth quarter and annual results conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in the call and that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during this call.
with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations.
before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. during the fourth quarter of 2020, sales reached $1.1 billion, down 35% compared with those of the corresponding quarter of the previous year, but up 12% sequentially, driven by a gradual recovery in drilling activity in the americas and a good mix of products sold in the middle east.
our quarterly ebitda at $192 million, which included several charges of $37 million and one-off gains of $70 million was 79% sequentially, reflecting a better industrial performance and the operating leverage of higher volumes on a lower fixed cost base after the restructuring measures implemented during the year. our quarterly ebitda margin recovered to 17%.
average selling prices in our tube-operated segment declined 2% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2019, but were up 2% sequentially. during the quarter, cash flow from operation was $139 million. our net cash position remained stable at $1.1 billion, following the payment of an interim dividend of $83 million in november last year and capital expenditures of $38 million.
the board of directors has decided to propose for the approval at the annual general shareholders' meeting to be held at the beginning of may, the payment of an annual dividend of $0.21 per share or $0.42 per adr, which includes the interim dividend of $0.07 per share or $0.13 per adr that we paid at the end of november of last year. if approved, a dividend of $0.14 per share or $0.28 per adr will be paid on may 26.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni, and good morning to all of you. 2020 was a particular year, which has left an invariable mark on the world. the pandemic is reshaping societal expectations and changing established paradigms. but it is still too early to understand the full extent of the transformation that has been going. the energy transition is also accelerating. we, as a company, wish to maintain flexibility in the short term as we redefine our strategy and action to meet the new reality.
at tenaris, we opened the year by concluding the acquisition of ipsco, and with the expectation that u.s. drilling activity will soon start to recover after a year-long decline. instead for us after, everything changed as the pandemic spread rapidly around the world. from one day to the next, demand for our products and services began to shrink and our way of working changed.
global oil demand collapsed over prices we fit, even becoming negative at one point. in the u.s., drilling activity plans precipitously, and we had to close most of our newly acquired facilities. the challenge involved every aspect of our business and affected all of our employees.
we had to adopt the new safety protocols for sure the safety of all the person entering our plants and offices, to have production while minimizing labor cost efficiencies as demand plummeted, to provide support for the medical system in many of our communities, to find new ways of making customer commitments, to change the way we work and communicate, all while implementing an intense restructuring program to ensure financial stability and long-term sustainability of our company.
we responded rapidly and have been disciplined in implementing our objectives. i would like to give a special thanks to all our employees for the way they adapted to the circumstances and their contribution to our efforts. since the start of the pandemic, we had a total loss of 2,250 persons affected by the virus among our employees and contractors, and an infection rate of a little over 10%.
currently, we have less than 100 active cases, and we still have 550 people in the at-risk category, who are prevented from coming to work. at the same time, we maintained the improvement we made over the past year in our safety measures. our contributions to reinforcing the medical infrastructure and equipment in our communities has been very well received, leveraging our global procurement structure.
we delivered ventilators, intensive care unit equipment unit and personal protection equipment, founded four new field hospitals in our diverse communities. our employees were quick to show solidarity and initiative. at the onset of the pandemic in bergamo, which was then the epicenter of the contagion in europe, they worked tireless to produce oxygen cylinder for the local hospitals. while in campana in argentina, they designed and produced more than 80,000 face shields for medical staff and first responders in the local community, using one of our finishing line.
in addition to maintaining service quality in a rapidly changing environment, we reinforced our rig direct customer programs by integrating digital initiatives aimed at simplifying operational and administrative processes and making them more reliable. in the u.s., for example, 2/3 of call-outs made to our rig direct customers are now made through our rig direct port, and customers are starting to use our price tracer system to perform digital tallies.
we will continue to deepen the digital integration initiative to reinforce service differentiation and customer loyalty. to secure the financial stability of the company, we implemented a detailed plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by $230 million or 25% by the end of 2020 and to generate cash through reducing inventories, managing receivables closely and reducing investment. we have met or exceeded our target generating $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the -- over the year, which include a $1.1 billion reduction in working capital.
our net income, excluding impairment and restructuring charges, remained positive. in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher ebitda margin than we had at the end of 2019, despite a 35% drop in revenue. with these results, strong balance sheet and a bright outlook ahead, we are proposing to raise state the annual dividend at 50% of the level it was prior to the pandemic.
as drilling activity in north america picks up, we are strengthening our position in the u.s. and canadian markets, building on our rig direct service proposition, consolidating our offer of tenarishydril wedge connection product, and taking advantage of the market opportunities offered by consolidation in the shale sector and the competitive environment.
we are preparing to operate in bay city at full capacity and to start up the koppel steel shop and ambridge seamless pipe mill, together with their associated finishing facilities later this year, as the market continues to improve. meanwhile, we are proceeding with our investment to integrate seamless premium and welded pipe production at our mill in sault ste. marie in canada after closing the prudential mill in calgary.
in offshore market, we have strengthened our position through the introduction of bluedock connector in the gulf of mexico and guyana. while in brazil, we are also successfully introducing our seamless riser product to replace flexible riser solution. in argentina, the implementation of a new planned gas is helping to reactivate activity in the vaca muerta shale play. in the middle east, we are supplying the casing for the expansion of the north field in qatar, which will provide the gas for the recently sanctioned qatar lng expansion.
this product will include our dopeless technology, which is now firmly established in this market. also, demand in the middle east during 2021 will be affected by ongoing destocking in key markets. we continue to consolidate our position in the united arab emirates with investments in its premium threading facility, which will begin operations in 2022. looking ahead, our raw material costs will be higher.
but also pipe prices are moving up, as shown in the pipe logix index, which has risen 23% since the recent bottom in august 2020. with our increased operating leverage, this will contribute to further margin improvement during the year. carbonization has become a major issue for all of the world, and in particular, for our industry.
yesterday, our board of directors approved a medium-term target to reduce the carbonization intensity of our operation by 30% from a 2018 baseline and the introduction of an internal carbon price of $80 per tonne to accelerated the investment necessary to achieve this target and our long-term objective of eventually reaching carbon neutral. we will give additional transparency and evaluation to this program, which we'll follow on a quarterly basis in our board when we joined the carbon disclosure project. this will become an even more important part of our agenda in the coming years.
we can now receive all the question you may have.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of igor levi from btig. your line is now open.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
thank you. so as you mentioned, in 2020, you generated over $1 billion in free cash flow from working capital, maybe about $200 million from operations. does the working capital tailwind turn into a headwind in 2021 as the market recovers? what is the best way for us to think about free cash flow this year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, igor, for your question. no doubt during 2020, we have been able to do an extraordinary effort in reduction of our working capital. now the market is picking up. our volume is picking up, and we need to start building back some of our working capital, starting in the first quarter of 2021. you also have to consider that even in the fourth quarter 2020, we anticipate some procurement of some of our metallics, envisaging the price increase that was coming.
so to some extent, we started increasing some of our working capital even in some items during the 4q. in the first q, we will recover. but then i think we will be able overall to continue to maintain a strict discipline in our working capital in the following quarter. the level of operation will also be relevant for this.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and could you provide a little more color on the pilot projects around carbon capture and hydrogen? and what is the road map, like, to grow that business? would you plan to develop it mostly internally? or would you also be looking to make bolt-on acquisitions in this space?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we are very confident in exploring new avenues to reduce the carbon content of our product. and in this sense, the pilot project that we are launching on hydrogen is an interesting event. we will basically use renewable power energy together with our partner in this project, which is edison and snam, for transforming [indecipherable] in hydrogen for feeding hydrogen to our electrical furnaces and to the extent possible to the heat treatment in our plant in dalmine.
this is, let's say, first pilot project in which we will explore the feasibility, the cost and the complexity and the technological requirement for utilization of hydrogen in substituting carbon in -- for heat purposes. this will the first project. we estimated at this moment this project may be economically viable. if we consider the cost of carbon in the range of $80 to $100, there will be -- we will use support -- financial support from the european community.
we want to explore this project. and by adopting an internal value for carbon, we will reevaluate investment in the different area of the company in light of carbon emission and see where we can eventually extend similar projects or substitute traditional carbon with renewable or project for heat utilization in some of the states.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ian macpherson from simmons. your line is now open.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
hi, thanks. paolo, you mentioned the raw material inflation, which we've seen has been staggering recently, but you are getting pricing to offset that. and when we think about your goal toward getting to 20% ebitda margins over the course of this year, what level of average selling price do you need to average into in order to get to 20% margins relative to where your q4 asp was?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, ian, for your question. i would say that to evaluate the evolution of our cost of goods sold, you should consider the cost of the input like metallics that are getting into our cost of sales gradually because of the inventory rollover. so this will enter gradually into our cost of sale, but then also the increase in production will improve absorption. so this is also important in the evolution of our cost.
on the other side, on the prices, up to now, the pipe logix went up by around 23% since, let's say, august last year up to now. also, this price increase will continue because if you look at the structure of the pricing, the pipe logix is driven by welded and seamless.
but in the case of welded, the increase has been 28%, reflecting the extraordinary increase in the cost of coils, not only in the united states, but also elsewhere in the world. so the increase in price, in our view, will gradually get into our sale and also, the cost will increase. but we think that we can reach and maintain a margin in the range of 20%, considering some additional increase of the pipe logix, not much compared to a step that has been done up to now.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
okay. understood. thank you. i also wanted to ask about your insights into the u.s. land market. i think we've been positively surprised by your results so far and your expectations for this year, given that the recovery has been driven so much by the private e&ps, and we think of your business being much more oriented toward the bigger players.
and so maybe you can speak to the recent evolution and the expectation going forward with your customer book as the more commodity price-sensitive privates are driving the increase of the share of activity so far. and when you think -- well, what sort of visibility you have really for your larger independent and e&p customers to get back in the saddle and have more activity in the second half of this year or into next year? thanks.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, again, ian. well, our view of the dynamics of activity in the united states probably is not considering now the level of price of oil above $60 that we see today. now this may introduce some additional level of activity because in the end, shales are showing increased free cash flow now with the price of oil at $60 or $62, they are adding cash flow to this, and we will see how they will react. but i will ask luca zanotti to give a view on the dynamics of different clients in the u.s.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.a.
yes, paolo. good morning, everybody. thank you, ian, for the question. now on top of paolo is saying, i would add that, yes, we are seeing the market to -- continuously improving because, as you probably have listened to some of the large independent conference call, they are thinking to gradually step in and increase activity. but there are two additional effects that i would like to mention that are relevant for tenaris, at least in the united states.
first is the effect of the consolidation. you know that we have been seeing consolidation and so far, we have been able to roll out our contracts to the company that has been acquired by our customer -- historical customers. and we think that this will continue going forward, given the long-term relationship that we have and all the tools that we introduce, the technology that is helping them to reach longer lateral. so we think that this will continue.
so i believe that this is something that is also important. and as paolo was mentioning before, third, with usd50, usd55 a barrel, the great majority of the shale plays are profitable. so it's going to be a decision of the operators on where they want to invest their proceedings. and we believe that also toward the end of the year, if the situation maintains at core level, in general, we're going to see the bigger guy to even increase further. so i believe that these three points are explaining a little bit our forward-looking environment.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
that's great. thank you, luca. thanks, paolo.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sean meakim from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you. i thought maybe we could follow up on the energy transition topic. could you maybe just elaborate on any incremental technological capabilities that maybe you don't have today that to be necessary to take on a leadership role, whether it's hydrogen, carbon capture? whether it's necessary to pursue some of these with internal r&d or if there could be technology, bolt-on acquisitions that may help you in those pursuits?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sean. well, first, tenaris is because of its process based on electric arc furnaces, today, emitting much less than the average in the industry. and the other collaboration that is using iron ore is using in argentina on dri, so also with a very limited carbon. now we see the target -- you have seen the target that we set for 2030, a reduction of 30% could be achieved within the existing technology, heat recovery, intervention of -- on the electric arc furnaces, reaction or ways in some of our operations and better use or better, let's say, selection of supplier in our operations, so we can reduce scope one, two, three overall by around 30.
now when we think about 2050, we will need to reduce disruptive technologies like hydrogen. we are considering offsetting investment in renewable to support part of our system. so we are looking globally at all what we can do to decarbonize our chain. but this will require five or 10 different endeavor to explore possibility -- opportunity for reduction.
in terms of carbon capture and storage, we may have or participate in progress jointly with other companies in which we capture part of the carbon we are emitting. this will not be something that could be done on the scale of our operation. needs to be integrated into projects with other companies. these are only, let's say, ideas. on that side, tenaris would be very important in promoting decarbonization and promoting extension of the project, then maybe you're right in this sense. i'll give you an example on hydrogen.
we are producing cylinder for very high-pressure hydrogen riser, and we are producing pipes for infrastructure use in the hydrogen chain. we are also important in supporting projects that are focused on carbon capture and storage. one example is northern light in north sea.
i mean, the know-how that we developed on the [indecipherable], on steel-making and on all the chain of our production could be very important in all of the segments of technologies that could contribute to decarbonization. we will do it, and we will actually be starting this. but today, we have no road map clear for, let's say, the second step of decarbonization that grant us -- let's say, that would make the definition of a reasonable target for, for instance, 2050.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
very interesting and very helpful. thank you. offshore, activity stays pretty challenged. but we did have a lot of fids into 2019, and they'll need to ramp activity in '22 and '23. can you maybe just talk about which markets you see offshore as most attractive medium term? i think brazil looks like one market, maybe just broader south america, north sea could be another, perhaps asia pac, to some degree. just how are you seeing the offshore market on a medium-term basis?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, if we look at the perspective of offshore, let's focus on, let's say, the deep offshore in [indecipherable]. we have a suite of products that are pretty unique and on which we can have an important leverage. but the region are basically the south america and brazil and guyana, is gulf of mexico, is north sea and far east, to some extent. we see also, to a lesser extent, some development in africa that will be important.
we are present in all of them. but i would ask gabriel, who's responsible for eastern hemisphere, to start on them with some of the projects that could be relevant from this model, if i understand well your question. gabriel will follow up on this, and then luca could comment briefly on gulf of mexico. i don't know if luca is on the line.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes, i can take it over while...
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
on the gulf of mexico sector.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. so as you said, paolo, we are present in all the developments that are now going on and are forecasted to start in the gulf of mexico. and in some cases, we are also increasing our participation on, let's say, shifting the technology toward our dopeless. and so i believe that as far as gulf of mexico is concerned, we are very well placed.
not to mention then, guyana, where these big exxon projects going on. and even there, we are the incumbent, and we are well placed in continuing, let's say, leveraging this opportunity. so as gulf of -- sorry, as offshore is going to improve, we're going to see also our activity improving in this respect. i don't know if...
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
just to remind, we have a very complete suite of products for shore and special deep offshore. we go from the connector to the riser, to all the parts of the column in the most demanding high-pressure, high-temperature product for deep offshore the port. this is recognized by the operator, not only in gulf of mexico, but also in brazil, in guyana, where we work with all of the major. i don't know if gabriel is...
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. hello, paolo, can you hear me? can you hear me? hello?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, yes, yes. yes, we can hear you.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
okay, ok. okay. great. sorry, i got disconnected there. i called back. so sean, on the point of offshore in the eastern hemisphere, first, i would comment that the drilling activity in this second year in the major offshore basins has been decreasing over the last 12 months. we're probably running today at a level of about 35% below the levels that we had at the -- below the -- before the pandemic. so this is what we see today. we expect this to be the bottom, and we foresee a gradual recovery of a pickup of activity toward, especially the second half of the year.
the key areas that probably were going to lead this increase are the core countries in the middle east, could be saudi arabia, could be qatar, uae, kuwait. these are the areas that they have some onshore and some offshore activity as well. and these are going to -- as the curtailment of production reduces during the year, we see this increase in production supporting a higher level of activity.
the other basins of north sea, west africa, southeast asia, will remain challenged. it will take longer to this -- for these markets to recover. we're going to see some pockets associated mainly with gas, maybe indonesia, papua new guinea, egypt, mozambique as well. so some projects and exploration that is going on related to gas developments, either for export or existing infrastructure or domestic markets, those are going to be areas of interest into the future, but it will take a while before these markets pick up again activity.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, gabriel. as far as the south america, i mentioned, but i think that brazil and guyana will be -- will increase and will expand on a long run, to our, let's say, dynamic offshore deepwater area in which we are very present.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
very good. thanks for that detail.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi from cowen. your line is now open. thank you. i wanted to follow up on the margin and pricing discussion. i heard that the pipe logix is up 23% from august, and the expectation is to get to your 20% is that it doesn't need to go up quite that much, the increase from here would be less than 23%. i'm curious if you don't get that increase, what would margins look like? because there is some component of operating leverage that you mentioned. and then the next question is, what kind of increase? is it something like 2% or 3%? or are we talking about a 15%-type increase there that you would need?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, marc. well, on one side, the increase that i mentioned is -- i mean, the index is -- the historical index, i mean, the index that comes out yesterday is showing the increase that i mentioned overall. so today, many of the formula that we have start incorporate this increase. now the point is will, in the coming months, the price of pipe continue to increase to reflect, let's say, the stronger cost -- the higher cost of the raw material in maus will not increase in the same pace, but we will have additional increase.
now considering what has been there in demand, there is, let's say, the reference for any new contract. flat or minus, it depends from negotiation from the difference in product, in terms of service, but this is a reference for the new contract. so it's something that is in the market today. so we are pretty close that on top of what has been done, price will continue.
also, i think that we will face a price of hot or cold or iron ore and of commodity relatively high for a while. i mean, it's not that we are in a spike, but i think that there is demand. and if we assume that stimulus in the united states and additional stimulus in the other region, some increased mobility because of the progress of vaccination, everything should drive the economy to rebound and to some extent, should preserve uptrend in cost, but also in price in our product.
this is the view we have, and this is the view on which is based our vision of a medium-term 20% margin, compensating with price, which we perceive are the increase in costs that we're getting. and as i was mentioning before, in terms of absorption, keep in mind that if -- the market really progressed, and we put into operation facility in the united states, in corporate, in ambridge and in finishing facility, there will be some stock buildup that will also absorb some of our -- so some of our fixed costs.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
thanks, paolo. i guess following on to that, you've had some nice improvements in your -- just in the way you run your business, right, larger proportion of rig direct in north america. you've done the m&a, which gets you more integrated. i'm curious now, do you think -- what do you think the medium-term or long-term margin profile is for the business as it exists today? could we be into the mid-20s? or do you care to put a number out there?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
you are referring to the margin -- the midterm to long-term margin in the u.s. market or you mean as a whole for our business? no, sorry because i say if you're referring to overall margin in north america because the line is not so good. if you can repeat the question?
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. i'll turn it back. yes, sorry. certainly. the question is, you've made some structural improvements to your business. you've taken the cost out. you've gotten more integration and more rig direct. but even still with these high raw materials, you think you're going to be to 20% in the back half of this year?
i'm wondering if -- as we get into 2022 and beyond, what type of margin would we expect for your overall business compared to this 20% level? could we be seeing something at 25% or higher than that? what's your medium to long-term expectations for the overall company?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't think that -- it will depend on the level of recovery and the level of drilling and activity. we have today around 400 rigs in the states. and the bottom has been 250 rigs. now we are in the range of 400 rigs under bakerhughes. we expect that these number of rigs could increase to around 500 rigs by the end of the year.
but if the drilling activity and free cash flow of the company allow, let's say, higher investments in the united states and the recovery also in the east hemisphere, but with a price of coiler relatively higher than what it is today, we will obviously have more pricing power given in an environment that is more dynamic. but it's difficult to say this today.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
yes. understood. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of frank mcgann from bank of america. your line is now open.
frank mcgann -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. i wanted to just ask your -- basically, your view based on what you're seeing from your clients and in your conversations. and this follows a little bit up on an earlier question, but just with a little bit longer-term view. there is a view that oil prices are going to stay quite robust and since it could go much higher over time, given that producers are going to continue to exercise significant capital discipline even with higher prices because of shareholder demands and their own concern for balance sheet, etc.
i was just wondering, do you see that happening? do you think that the main companies, your largest customers anyways, are likely to continue for an extended period to see very limited activity for those reasons? or do you think, over time, things can loosen up pretty substantially if we continue to see oil staying at $65, $70 and potentially higher?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think that we are talking here about very different players. you have a player like the major that are promoting large complex products that for sure are following discipline in the project. so you can expect that the progress in big complex projects, offshore, the production will be, to some extent, contained. then you have the middle east, the player that has large reserve and they're playing a different game.
they want to remain the key supplier. this is also true for russia. i mean, player that bets on the fact that any transition will any way require important supply of oil and gas to the world. these players are following their own products. then even in u.s., you have the divided opinion because there are companies that are focusing on cash flow, dividend and shareholder, so other that are betting. and they are betting that if the transition, the energy transition will any way leave space for oil and gas, and the price of oil and gas could be assuring important return.
they look at issues like the texas freeze, and they perceive that in balance in the energy system, they offer opportunities. so it's a diverse group of players, there are players that are very disciplined and wants to shift out from this, but others that want to take the place that the first one are leaving. so in my view, you cannot have, let's say, one attitude fit all. and in this environment, i frankly think that investments in oil and gas, maybe by different players, in the u.s. and outside, will be continuing. maybe the more complex products will be proceeding at a more careful pace.
frank mcgann -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. does that -- it sounds like you believe then that, that can lead to at least over a period of time or a number of years, a pretty substantial recovery in activity.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that any transition associated with expansion of the world economy will require, let's say, substantial investments in the fossil, oil and gas, especially in the coming years. so this is not a transition that could be done without substantial investment. there are companies that bet on this. there are companies that bet on reducing their exposure. we have to follow this. but in the end, in an aggregate view, i think that there will be recovery in 2022 and beyond. and if the growth in the emerging markets continues, this will need to be substantial.
frank mcgann -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alan spence from jefferies. your line is now open.
alan spence -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks and good afternoon. i've got two questions, and i'll take them one at a time. the first one is around working capital. you released about $1.6 billion combined in the last two years. is there any component of this that we should think is structural? or is it going to be predominantly technical and ultimately, in the next few years come back in?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
if i understand the first question is concerning our working capital. there will be a recovery of working capital because when -- especially in the first quarter and probably because the volume is increasing, and we have to activate some of the longer lead time road will be recovering the working capital need. and then there is, i would say, a second issue that is when we activate koppel steelmaking in the united states, finishing in united states, these new mills may require and will require some working capital.
on the other side, the introduction of much higher level of digitalization, programming and, let's say, designing of production into the system, there is something that is part of our digital transformation will contribute to a strict discipline in the existing facility. so the combination of these two, in my view, will not bring back tenaris to the same level of inventory that we had in the past, but we will increase our inventory requirements in the first quarter and to some extent, also in the second quarter, while we are comparing the start-up of the plant.
alan spence -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you. and the second one, on this 30% reduction in co2 intensity. if i understood correctly from an earlier question, i think you said that could be achieved with your current portfolio of assets. does that mean that you don't foresee any material increase in capex related to achieving that -- those targets medium term?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we will have to invest. we are -- as you see, our investment has been reduced in 2020 to around $200 million. now in 2021, we plan to remain in the range of $200 million of capex, including some of the first in the line investments in energy savings, but including also, let's say, the start-up investment in the translation of the plant of prudential to sault ste. marie in canada, the venture in emirates in each line. so this will be the range of investment for 2021.
then i think that the decision of capex for the following year will very much depend on the evolution of the market in the second part of 2022. the investment to reach a reduction in our carbon of 30% are let's say, in a period of 3, four years, not, let's say, of an order of magnitude that is strong. we think that we will require in the range of $150 million in the coming four years to reach the target of 30% reduction.
alan spence -- jefferies -- analyst
very clear and very helpful. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of david anderson from barclays. your line is now open.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. just a question on the u.s. octg market. where do you think the inventory kind of overhang is today? something you kind of keep an eye on. and i'm just kind of curious how much it's come down and where you think it needs to come down, how much more needs to come down before demand starts to kind of truly improve, just looking at the u.s. land market?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. on this, i will let luca to give an overview of how we see the situation of the stock curve in the market.
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.a.
yes. thank you, paolo. good morning, david, in the u.s., as we speak, we see a level of inventory in the range of six to 6.5 months of inventory, which, as you know, is starting to get in a situation in which in some cases and some items we're going to be short. and you can easily see this when you look at the pipe logix detail as well.
now going forward, i believe that we're going to see a little bit of additional decrease. but then when production in the states and, to a certain extent, imports, we begin, the situation is going to be stabilizing. and this is basically it -- as far as the inventory on the ground in the united states are concerned.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. my other question probably for gabriel, i don't know if he's still on the line. but you had indicated the middle east was pretty strong for you this quarter. it's not something we've heard from the service companies so far, haven't seen really rigs being picked up, and we're generally hearing kind of middle east nocs are planning to ramp up in the second half of '20. so i guess i'm just wondering, are you seeing your customers in the middle east are starting to order octg in advance of that? i guess i'm just wondering, are we starting to see the beginning of potentially a prolonged international cycle?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you. on this, i will have gabriel, who is very close to the major client in middle east to give with you the view. gabriel, it's up to you.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
i had a feeling we're going to have that problem. that's ok. you can follow up with me afterwards.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
i understand you. our view in general, i can tell you, it is that the rig went down during this period and didn't recover yet. we expect 2021 to be subdued in the middle east even if the projects that we see in qatar, the unconventional in saudi are sustained and substantial. [indecipherable] very important plant. but we will see this more in 2022 than in 2021.
this is relevant for us because, i mean, we expect our -- probably our sales to be more contained in -- during 2021. this is important because some of our very special products are going in that part of the world. but still, we are very confident in the recovery in 2022.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
great. makes sense. thank you very much. thank you. our next question comes from the line of amy wong from ubs. your line is now open.

hi, there. a couple of questions from me, please. the first one relates to -- i think you mentioned you guys have an award for qatar lng north field expansion. can you give a bit more color on that project, what you're delivering there, whether it's casing, line pipe or both? and kind of when those deliveries will start for you? that's my first question, please.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
just to clarify, you were mentioning the project in qatar. if i understand well. sorry, because the line is not so clear. is this true?
amy wong -- ubs -- analyst
yes. yes, sorry, yes. the qatar north field, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you guys have won some work there. so i just want to get a bit more color on the size of the award, when you're going to start delivering.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, work that -- the program that qatar has in line is substantial. they revived, they [indecipherable] too and they will develop this. we have a very solid relation, and we developed for this project dopeless product that are very much appreciated like koppel. and let's say we will be a supplier of this product. now in our understanding, qatar is proceeding aggressively. again, we will have the -- the project is a long-term project. so we will have demand growing in 2020.
we expect in respect to 2019. and we will say 2021, more or less in the same level. but the project is very important. the relation is strong, product development systems solid, and i think we have a good opportunity for the long run while they develop stores of lng. they have a big program for enhancing production of lng, and they need the gas coming from north east. i don't know if gabriel is back for additional comments or color on this. if he is back, i will ask him to add his comment.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes, paolo, i'm back. apologies for the interference with the line today. i guess the topic was qatar project lng, correct?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. okay. yes, ok. yes, this has been an important project that we have been sourcing for the last couple of years under a framework of a multiyear agreement that we have with qatar gas, the major operator of the lng in qatar, which they have recently this quarter fid and a first expansion. this is -- we are having a dominance there in this important development. majority of the supply is with our dopeless technology.
the drilling team in qatar has selected the technology based on its safety and efficiency concerns. so this is something that will have pushed our shipments supporting 2020, and it's something that we expect to increase into 2021 and beyond. this has been one of the pockets of highly differentiated products that helps our shipments into 2020.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thank you, gabriel.
amy wong -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you for that. i just have another separate question unrelated to that, and it's regarding your target of reducing carbon emissions intensity by 30% in 2030. could you talk a little bit more about how you're defining that? is it your total co2 emissions over the tonnes of tubes produced? but just give a bit more color on what metric you're using and give us what the baseline you're measuring against is.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
we will define that we are following this on the three scopes. the scope one of our emission, scope two of material and energy that we buy, electric energy that we buy, the scope three with this material that we acquire and carbon emitted in our chain. so we are, let's say, following the standard design by the worldsteel, and we will have this in the process of qualifying for the carbon disclosure project.
we will [indecipherable] in a market size and verifiable way. we plan also to ask to pricewaterhouse when we issue our sustainability report to audit the data that we will present and the number that we will present. so we will be very demanding on the clarity of our definition, the transparency of our number and the clarity of our commitment. and then we will follow this quarterly in our board.
probably, we will have a full qualification by cdp, maybe during next year because of the process of qualifying and presenting our case with the carbon disclosure program and get rated by them. but this will be a process. there will be, let's say, audited and qualified and followed with numbers that are in line according to the standard. we are also considering, let's say, to rely on the plant-based target process for defining with clarity the action that we are taking and the impact that we are expecting on our decarbonization road map.
amy wong -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. looking forward to get more information on that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of connor lynagh from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thank you. thanks for squeezing me in. i just wanted to square some of the comments you made around the eastern hemisphere. in the release, it sounded relatively conservative. you pointed to some longer-term potential in the middle east. it sounds like offshore is probably maybe stable, but not really increasing much. i just sort of wanted to square that in light of the expectation that most of the opec producers will be raising production somewhat this year and the commentary that we've heard from the other service companies that suggest a second-half ramp in eastern hemisphere activity.
do you think there's a destocking effect that you're pointing to? or are you just being conservative because customers haven't communicated these plans yet? i'm just wondering if you could sort of square the circle in terms of why you wouldn't expect that to be recovering more significantly this year.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
very good. well, i don't know, on this issue, maybe if gabriel recovered the line, he may just add some comments. i would leave it maybe to you to add some color on the attitude that you see in our major clients in the gulf.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes. thank you, paolo. thank you for the question. indeed, the activity is expected to slowly go up for the major countries in the middle east, especially in the second half from a low level. this is what we expect. on the other hand, as you're pointing out, there has been -- there is a destocking, there is an efficiency and optimization of cash flow going on in some of the key markets in the middle east.
that's why with this subdued activity, coupled with this delay in some shipments, some purchases, we expect apparent demand and shipments in 2021 to be lower than in 2020. and as activity improves during this year and the purchasing cycle normalizes, that's why we expect a rebound into 2022.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. got it. i mean, i guess, that seems -- sorry. yes. i guess the sort of follow-up here is you have these relatively large projects. i guess just one small clarifying question. you were alluding to the threading plant in the uae being online next year. are you going to be making shipments under the adnoc contract before that's completed? or is that necessary in order for that to move forward? i think the prior expectation was back half this year that would start up.
but i guess the follow-up question in a greater sense is could you maybe level set once this destocking, presumably, activity is recovering. it seems like you're setting up for -- with some of these specific things, a relatively big year-over-year growth in 2022 in the middle eastern area. could you maybe quantify at all how we should think about the magnitude of that?
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
yes, yes. indeed, related to the uae, the mega tender contract that will last for at least five years, and there are options to extend, started in 2020 with very little shipment because as there is a change of the supply chain model into our rig direct. typically, in this contract, it takes one or two years to work through the existing inventories until we synchronize shipments with drilling activity. so contracts started. we have the new service center in abu dhabi in place, started at the mid of 2020.
this year, we'll slowly during the year ramp up our shipments as steel inventories come down, and it's probably going to be until 2022, that we will have our full shipments in line with the level of consumption of adnoc. so this is how typically the first two years this contract will be played out and then continuing to the following years with an increase of expected of activity of adnoc in the midterm. this is something that will give strength to this in this year. and in other areas, although they are not working on the rig direct, but still, there is an intense of the nocs to keep capex still contained.
there is a cash flow concern as well in some of these countries. so delays of purchasing, delays of tenders are putting some, let's say, additional lower shipment scenario in this 2021, but we foresee that to stabilize apparent demand and consumption to be more in line into '22.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the first quarter 2021 tenaris s.a. earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, speaker giovanni sardagna, head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
thank you, nora. and welcome to tenaris' 2021 first quarter conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in this call and that our actual results may vary from those expressed from -- may -- from those expressed or implied during this conference call. with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operation; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations. before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. our sales in the first quarter reached $1.2 billion, down 33% compared to those of the previous year but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by a recovery in sales in north america, partially offset by lower sales in the eastern hemisphere. average selling prices in our tubes operating segment declined 4% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2020 and 5% sequentially mainly due to a poorer geographic sales mix. our ebitda for the quarter, which included $23 million of additional costs associated to the winter storm in texas, was up 2% sequentially to $196 million, reflecting continued improvement in our industrial performance. our ebitda margin was stable at around 17%. our quarterly net income of $106 million benefited from a strong contribution from our investment in ternium. during the quarter, working capital increased by $83 million mainly due to higher inventories, which reflect the increased level of activity. with operating cash flow of $70 million and capital expenditures of $45 million, our free cash flow amounted to $25 million. our positive financial position remained flat during the quarter at around $1.1 billion.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions. thank you.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni. and good morning to all of you. our first quarter results show the progress we are making with our repositioning in the u.s. market despite the impact of the texas freeze which affected production volume as well as costs. drilling activity had been increasing steadily through the first part of the year, though it remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels, and is supported by current oil and gas price levels and operator cash flow. pipe inventory are returning to more normal level. pipe price are on an upward trend, reflecting increased demand and raw material costs. with hot rolled coil prices making welded pipe production uncompetitive at current price levels, there is an opportunity for tenaris to strengthen its position in the market and expand its range of customers. this opportunity is reinforced by the ongoing consolidation in the shale sector, where our customer has offered us the opportunity to extend our service to their newly acquired operations. as a result, we continue to advance our rig direct service model as the preferred way of working among many operators and consolidate our offer of tenarishydril wedge production casing [indecipherable] while we are expanding our service to reach smaller operators. in the u.s., we will fully deploy our unique industrial capability as we ramp up our bay city mill to its full capacity, reopen our conroe plant; and start-up of the koppel steel shop operation and ambridge seamless pipe mill, together with field associated finishing facilities. we will incorporate 1,000 employees into our u.s. operations this year. we are also structuring our position in the middle east.
after our success in the adnoc tender in 2019, we are well positioned in the recent kuwait deep drilling tender to take a majority share of the tender volume. this will be a three-year agreement, with deliveries expected to begin in 2022. considering this another long-term agreement we have been awarded, we are building a substantial backlog of order expected to exceed $3 billion, which will be -- will support a significant increase in sales in the region from 2022. we continue to consolidate our positioning in growing offshore regions such as brazil, the guyana-suriname basin and the black sea, extending customer adoption of our specialized range of products. we have just been awarded a 100 million contract for the supply of pipes for an offshore pipeline in the black sea based on deliveries from our plant in dalmine around the end of the year. in an industry which is increasingly turning its attention to the energy transition, we are accompanying our customers as they develop low-carbon energy businesses. over the past quarter, we were awarded a contract for the supply of pipes for the offshore pipeline to be built in norway for the northern lights carbon transportation and storage project, with deliveries expected next year. we were also awarded a five-year agreement for the supply and storage -- for the supply of storage vessels for the network of hydrogen-fueling station that shell is rolling out in california. our research and product development teams are working with customers and industry experts to explore a specific requirement and develop new product to support these nations' sectors.
as our sales and margin recover following the pandemic, we are focused on supporting the expansion with new digital tools aimed at reducing the lead time and inventory required to support our rig direct operation and strengthening the operation of our customers, optimizing the programming of our industrial systems and supply chain management operations. even if the pandemic is subsiding in some regions, many of our operation are in countries where the impacts of the pandemic is still at critical levels. it is essential that we maintain our discipline to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees and secure our operations as well as our support for our communities. following our announcement last quarter of our 2030 carbon intensity reduction targets, we are looking closely at our agenda for the decarbonization of our operations. we are advancing with an investment that will reduce the carbon footprint and improve efficiency for larger enterprise in our dalmine mill in italy. we welcome the fact that our customer are starting to look more closely at our environmental performance, as we believe that we have a competitive advantage here. we are aware that this will be a critical area for our competitiveness in the coming years, and we will use our solid financial position to strengthen our differentiation. to have a more complete picture of what we are doing, it is interesting to read the sustainability report that we published last month.
we are open now to receive any question you may have.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of ian macpherson with simmons.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
paolo, i was interested to hear about your bidding on the kuwait tender, a three-year contract starting next year. how would you characterize the volume and the mix of that tender relative to your current business? because i look at your middle east region revenues. you've been -- in 2019 and '20, they were $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of revenues per year. and you're obviously down very significantly this year, but as we expect the opec region to reopen, it sounds like you're also taking share. and i wanted to see how your expectations for the revenue level in that region could progress next year as you take on that contract in addition to your existing business.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
thank you, ian. you're right, the -- our middle east sales down in this quarter. they will recover. and they will recover, i will say, much more in 2022, but i will ask gabriel podskubka to give a view of the business in middle east; and specifically of the tendering, where it is very substantial trend.
gabriel podskubka -- president, eastern hemisphere
okay, thank you, paolo. ian, in fact, as you were pointing out, this quarter in the middle east and africa segment was particularly low. we had some end of pipelines and coating projects in saudi and west africa and also some seasonal lower octg shipments into qatar and iraq. from the activity point of view, the international rig count has bottomed at a level of around 38% versus pre-pandemic levels. and from this low point, we expect a gradual ramp-up of activity during 2021, as -- and as you were pointing out during your question, lead -- to be led by the opec countries. so our sales will partially recover in the upcoming two quarters as we resume shipments in qatar, in iraq while we phase out the previous kuwait contract. now going in particular to the award, i take the opportunity to congratulate our team in the middle east, who has done an outstanding job in positioning tenaris for this important award in kuwait. the contract will be slightly above $600 million, representing about 65% share in koc's tubular needs for their deep drilling segment. deep drilling is a critical area for the country to meet its gas production targets. these are very demanding drilling conditions, deep wells. environment is sour, hp/ht, so all factors contributing to a high-end product mix, ok? the contract will last probably three to 3.5 years, starting, as paolo mentioned, early 2022. so this compounded with the adnoc award and other ltas, this will substantially increase our level of shipments into 2022 and onwards.
ian macpherson -- simmons -- analyst
that's very helpful. now i also wanted to ask. it's good to see that the business is expanding. you say you're hiring 1,000 people over the course of this year. it's been -- we've had such extreme cyclicality recently. you're just finishing the restructuring expenses from the past year-plus, so are there going to be any incremental start-up expenses that we should think about associated with this, the hiring and the reactivation of capacity, that would be separate from your 20% ebitda objective for the third quarter?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, you are right. we will -- we are now ramping up our operation in the u.s. to respond to the increase in demand. this will lead to a significant increase in our sales in the second q and in the third q following the increase in demand. we are -- in this start-up, we are incurring in costs of this, but i mean we are -- when we are, let's say, mentioning or guiding the level of ebitda margin, we are considering this included into it because in the end some of this expenditure is related to facility that are operating now, like in the case of bay city. so in this facility, we are hiring people. we raised level of operation in bay city or in mccarty or in hickman, and we cannot consider this a substantial additional expenditure. some additional expenditure will be required by the koppel and ambridge, the new mills that we really are starting from idle, but i think we are considering this in our forecast. the increase in volume and in revenue will be important. and this, to support and to respond to this increase in volume, it is important that we execute very effectively and efficiently this start-up for this operation.
operator
your next question comes from the line of marc bianchi with cowen.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
so it sounds like, second quarter, third quarter, the volume and sales will be pretty strong for north america. i was curious if you could perhaps quantify the expectation overall for maybe volume and asp in second quarter, third quarter. i'm sure there is some uncertainty, but maybe if you could give us a little bit of a guide there would be helpful.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, as i will say, our results in the coming quarter will be characterized, will be marked by a significant increase in volume mainly in the u.s. and north america, while the activity in the middle east will recover but slightly on this. this is implying that our mix in term of sales will be affected more by the increase in the sales in the u.s. now in the u.s. also prices will be increasing and more than offset the increase that we have in the cost. so going on, the increase in sales will be significant. and we expect that we are able to raise gradually our ebitda margin over time, but the mix between sales in the north america that has basically a lower price per tonne and a more -- relatively more simple mix compared to the rest of this will be, let's say, containing in the increase in our overall average price per tonne.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. so the target is to be around 20% for third quarter. i know there are some moving parts in terms of your inventory of perhaps scrap and other metal costs that are perhaps below where the leading-edge market prices are. i'm curious how you see things evolving beyond third quarter just between everything we've seen in the pricing and pipe logix and the tight market that you mentioned and then also on the raw materials side.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, as i say, we expect the increase in price and like as you see in the pipe logix to offset what we see as the increase in our raw material costs. i'm not referring to the hot rolled coils that we -- really is increasing very, very much, but i'm referring to the costs of scrap or iron ore. now this increase in price and decrease in pipe logix is translating into an increase in our sales price only gradually because we have contract. our rig direct business model is basically based on contract and agreement with clients that have some kind of delays, some reference or formula that are not synchronic. so the increase in price is getting into our sales gradually, but it's getting there. so this is what we expect. and when the increase in the volume, as i say, will be significant, you can imagine how things will evolve. the ebitda will reflect this mix between u.s. and rest of the world or more complex mix in the other region.
operator
your next question comes from the line of igor levi with btig.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
so your raw material -- the raw material costs have risen quite high at this point, but your cost of goods sold surprisingly continue -- per tonne. they continue to go down even this quarter, so could you talk about how you're able to drive that cost decrease on a per-tonne basis? and what raw material costs are currently embedded in your inventory? are they basically marked to the -- to where the market is right now?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, thank you, igor. our cost, the raw material, is getting into our cost of goods sold only gradually because -- for ifrs. we will see the full impact of the increase of the costs that we have today only, let's say, in -- basically in the third and fourth quarter. i mean it's getting into our cost of goods sold only gradual. that's the reason why i'm saying the price increase will more than offset in absolute terms this increase in costs, clearly, but we will see the costs increasing only gradually. the effect, as i say, will be embedded in the cost of goods over the -- mainly in third q and fourth q...
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. and...
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, there is one concept, the absorption. in an environment in which we are raising strongly and fast our level of production, also the absorption is contributing to a containment of our cost of goods sold. also, have you noticed that our depreciation went down from the fourth quarter into the first quarter? because in the last two quarters of last year, we had anticipated depreciation for canada and for mills in the united states in an amount of around $40 million. this is no longer affecting our depreciation. so you'll see in the containment of the costs of goods sold also the impact of absorption due to a much higher level of production.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. and then on the energy transition theme, it was great to hear that you're participating on carbon capture and hydrogen projects already. would you be able to comment on the type of spec of pipe that is required for those applications? and how does the margin on those -- on that type of work compare to what you're earning on your oil and gas business?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, in the specific case of the northern lights, i mean, these are product -- complex product, but i mean the margin are not very different from the margin that we have on complex offshore pipeline in this case. the full range of product that goes into hydrogen development and carbon capture and sequestration is, let's say, a complex set of products to face the challenges of hydrogen and co2, but in the case of northern light, let's say, the margin that we expect is similar to the margin of nova complex pipelines offshore. the issue here is embrittlement in the case of h2, hydrogen; and corrosion in the case of co2. products that should resist embrittlement and corrosion are products on which we have a clear differentiation. for instance, in our cylinder for hydrogen, it's clearly we have a much higher margin, but when we talk about line pipeline, northern lights, you can compare this managing complex pipeline.
operator
your next question comes from the line of connor lynagh with morgan stanley.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
you were alluding to this dynamic somehow in your prepared remarks, but just wanted to get some incremental color on this. so when we look at the price of seamless pipe versus welded pipe there, at least part of the data we track about is as close as they've ever been. certainly i think you alluded to that leading to some market share opportunities for you, but is there a pricing tailwind from the lower-grade products pushing on the higher-grade products? how should we think about that?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
sorry. i didn't get that part. you are asking for the -- can you repeat the last part of the question as well...
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. basically is -- the pricing momentum in welded, which seems to be more significant than that on seamless, is there a delayed follow-through we should expect from that? or do -- or should we think about it as more of just driving incremental market share for your seamless production?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
yes, you are perfectly right. the -- if you look at pipe logix, welded pipe increased since the bottom point by 45%, in the case of welded; 32% in the case of seamless. the increase in welded is reflecting the increase in hot rolled coils. now this is giving us an opportunity to advance and gaining market share in some lines that are shifting from welded to seamless because of the price pressure they are facing in the welded. so this is an opportunity for gaining market share and clients but is also a stimulus to, let's say, increasing prices in general. as i was saying, you see these getting into our sales over time, following the time of the formulas that are embedded in our contract with the different client, but you are right, is an opportunity for us. in -- we mentioned it in the opening remark. because in my view it's something that is changing, especially in the north america, in the u.s. and in canada, changing the competitive lens. but this is also true for some pipeline the rest of the region where there are alternative between seamless and welded. the increased costs of welded worldwide, of hot rolled coils and plates worldwide leave some room for our large diameter seamless mill, especially from italy.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful context. i was wondering if we could maybe just return to this pricing-versus-cost dynamic. it sounds like basically the pricing that you already sort of expect to receive based on your contracts is getting you already to that 20% mark. i guess the question is, if we were to mark raw materials to market sort of where things are today, do you need to realize further price increases in the pipe logix or whatever marker you have out there in order to get to that 20%? or is the 20% guidance based on what you already know you're going to receive on pricing? i hope that makes sense but moving off that.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
no. the guidance we are giving of 20% related to an environment of increased volume and sales and a gradual increase in our sales reflecting the price increase that has been basically in the market today. there will be additional increase, in my view, in the pipe logix, but when we are guiding the 20%, we are basically guiding on the price increase that's happened until today; and some marginal increases we may expect and on a substantial stability in pricings part of our raw materials but that will reflect in our cost of sale gradually, as i was saying, during the third -- marginally in the second quarter and more substantially in the third and fourth q. these are the premises on which basis we are guiding. now in my view, if the rigs count continue to raise over time and the price of hot rolled coil remain the level -- or present level or even lower, there will be room for additional increase in the price and pipe logix. this is what we expect.
operator
your next question comes from the line of alessandro pozzi with nuevo banco.
alessandro pozzi -- nuevo banco -- analyst
no, it's more mediobanca, but that's ok. the -- i was wondering. your guidance for 20% is q3 rather than q2. i was wondering. what was the main reason for the shift? i know it's just a quarter, but i was wondering what is the main reason behind the shift in marginality in -- from q2 to q3. also you mentioned much higher volumes in north america, but at the same time, i think rig count is slowing down a little bit in the rate of growth, so i was wondering. should we look at -- i mean, is -- what is -- what type of lag in month is between rig count and the volumes in north america?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
thank you, alessandro. i think i would ask luca to give some color on how we perceive things going on in north america. and this is, let's say, the area in which we expect the larger expansion in our volume of sale for the coming quarter. luca...
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.a.
yes. thanks, paolo. alessandro, no, yes -- i mean our focused are based, as you know -- i mean the great majority of our contracts are linked with direct and so to long-term contracts. and what we see as growth is linked to the forecasts that are -- that our customer are giving us in the short term, so what you'll see in the next quarter and most likely in the following is volume that we're pretty sure we can materialize now. if the rig count would increase more, which it is what i believe -- we expect this to keep on increasing. we may have some upsides there. however, as paolo already mentioned, you're going to see a significant increase of volume from q1 to the last quarter of the last year, from q2 to q1 and also from q3 to q2, to -- as far as the prices are concerned, going back to what paolo was saying, we believe that in the end, also considering that the inventory on the ground has broken the six months mark, according to our expectation, we should see pipe logix to continue go up even because there is still a very low spread between the seamless and the real value. and this will be an upside to our forecast.
alessandro pozzi -- nuevo banco -- analyst
and on the shift of guidance from q2 to q3...
luca zanotti -- president, u.s.a.
sorry. can you say it again...
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
the reason while well -- i mean we perceive that during q2 we will see, let's say, a gradual increase, i was saying, of our sales price, strong increase in our volume, but we gave a reference that we consider a more, let's say, indicating a medium-term trend. but we will see part of this in the second q also.
alessandro pozzi -- nuevo banco -- analyst
okay. and just a final one: do you have any indication of what the ebitda could be in q2?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, we are moving among -- i mean, in an environment of increasing sales, the bitda will increase in absolute term, but in term of margin, even if we exclude the texas freeze, ebitda of the first quarter is in the range of 19%. it will in term of margin increase gradually. in absolute term, it will increase.
alessandro pozzi -- nuevo banco -- analyst
okay. is there going to be any other one-offs in q2?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, for the moment, we have no indication of -- nothing similar to the texas freeze that has been very substantial. i think, unless there is something related to the pandemia or some disruption that could come from the sourcing in countries that are more exposed, we do not see particular issue that could affect one-off this quarter.

your next question comes from the line of amy wong with ubs.
amy wong -- ubs -- analyst
i have a couple of questions, please, one focused on the short term and then one on the longer term. in the short term, i'm thinking about your comments about eastern hemisphere recovering in the second half, but you also typically have a third quarter seasonal decline in your volumes, so how do we think about the dynamic of the recovery and a cyclical declined? what should we be expecting in volumes and particularly as we move from 2q to 3q? that's the short-term question. on the longer term, i just wanted to go back to your announcement a couple of months ago about reducing your carbon emission intensity by 30% by 2030. can you quantify the sort of investments or -- that you may need to make in terms of your plants and equipment and your -- to achieve that kind of co2 emission reductions?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
yes. well, in the first question: we project an increase in volume in the second q and the third q in both of them independently from the seasonal that is affecting mainly europe, but the mix will reflect a strong increase in north america; increase also in europe, in all of the -- let's say, the components that we are selling to non-energy segment, industrial and segment related to automotive that will also increase; and slightly less from eastern hemisphere. that's the reason why the increase in our overall price of sale will reflect the change in mix that is containing this increase. in term of carbon reduction. as you know, we committed a 30% reduction in our co2 emission. we expect to invest in the range of $150 million in the next four years to achieve the target. part of this investment will be realized this year. particularly, in italy we are investing during the course of this year, but i mean this $150 million will be distributed along this period of time. this is our program today. we are continually exploring opportunities for -- let's say, for adding additional program or projects that could reduce our carbon footprint, but this is one we have in hand concretely for the time being.
amy wong -- ubs -- analyst
okay. to follow up on that. so the $150 million is a -- is an investment to achieve that change. what about operating costs when we think -- when we kind of move out to that point? will the cost per tonne be substantially different? or how do we think about that?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
no. i think this -- the program that we have are a program of investments that are justified by the economics of the existing condition today. what i mean is that, if there is a change, for instance, in the price of carbon in some of the region in which we operate, then we have -- we will have to consider additional program based on different economics. this program has a return in the condition -- in existing today condition.
operator
your next question comes from the line of vlad sergievskii with bank of america.
vlad sergievskii -- bank of america -- analyst
a couple of questions, if i may try to clarify your volume and pricing outlook in the near term. so on shipments, i mean, in the last two quarters, you grew shipments by about 10% every quarter. when you're alluding to strong growth in the next two quarters, does it mean that growth will be higher than those 10%? and if you could perhaps give us a range of the growth, that would be very helpful. and then on the realized prices, i understand there is a trend of less-favorable mix but higher sales prices overall. would it be fair to assume that -- the realized prices for the year actually bottoming in q1? or it's too early to say.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, i mean, increasing volume, i will say significant, significantly higher than 10% in the two quarters. and i think this is where we see the results of increase in the market in north america and increasing our market share. as far the prices, if i understand well your question, as i say, the increase in the pipe logix, the reference, will get into our sale price with some delay because of the nature of the rig direct agreement with the different client, but we will get there. and we expect price -- pipe logix also to continue to increase in the coming months. in our forecast, we are not considering this additional increase substantial, but we consider that it will happen.
vlad sergievskii -- bank of america -- analyst
that's great. and if i can squeeze a longer-term question: in the last year and during this year, octg market globally has had some clear consolidation trends. it's happened among distributors in the u.s. and among producers in the eastern hemisphere. do you see the scope for any further meaningful consolidation in octg globally? and if yes, then is tenaris still willing to become a consolidator, if i may ask this.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, this is a more, let's say, medium-, long-term view. in our forecast, we expect, let's say, in -- following the energy transition, we expect the demand and drilling for oil and gas to continue to grow in the coming year because we need to substitute part of the core that has been -- that is used largely in china, in other countries; and to shift the metrics in a way that leave more room for gas. so overall we still expect drilling to grow in the coming five, 10 years; and then peak; and the demand for oil and gas to start reducing [indecipherable]. i mean this environment -- our market may be growing for a while, but we need to imagine that on the long term the consolidation will be important in our market. and tenaris is clearly the stronger and leading player in this. we are financially very strong. we are, as we did in the past, considering option that could create value for our shareholder related to consolidation. and we will be prepared for this when we see that opportunities could be had.
operator
your next question comes from the line of faisal qureshi with jefferies international.
faisal qureshi -- jefferies international -- analyst
just i would like to know. in an environment of rising input costs and rising hrc prices, what impact will this have on your working capital investment in the coming quarters?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
thank you, faisal. in this environment, we will not increase volume for our operation. we will gradually increase our inventories, but what is mostly affecting our working capital will be receivable. the volume, as i say, of our sale will increase and receivable will be higher. in inventories, let me tell you that, during the first quarter, we raised our level of inventory of raw material. and we do not expect a very substantial increase in inventory because we think that we should be able now to manage our rig direct model with more efficient use of inventory, of working capital and so to contain the increase in our working capital. in other words, we expect to increase working capital less than the increase in our sales. still there will be absorption of cash flow to support increase. well, now hot rolled coil is not one of our -- where -- i mean it's not a relevant component of our inventories. our inventories are mainly the scrap, iron ore and the labor and energy that are embedded in increased production levels. now in this sense we see that hot rolled coil that has high price and, in my view, will remain at very high prices during 2021 is not a key component of our working capital. we are more focused on seamless in this moment, and that's a reason for this.
operator
your next question comes from the line of vebs vaishnav with coker & palmer.
vebs vaishnav -- coker & palmer -- analyst
okay. just i know that people have tried to ask this question, so maybe if i can rephrase or make sure that i understand how you guys are thinking about 2q and 3q. so it seems like, when you talk about significant increases, you are talking about maybe around 10% revenue growth in 2q. and you are talking about around 19% gross margins. and maybe then i think -- in response to questions to amy's, i think it talked -- it seems like you still think 3q revenues would still be higher from 2q despite seasonality, with ebitda margins around 20%. am i phrasing that correctly?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
yes. basically, as i mentioned before, the increase in our sales will be higher than the 10% in the next q and will continue to grow. and the change in the mix, the increase in the price in our sales gradually and in the cost of sale, keep in mind that the absorption is an important component because in the end, when we increase production, our cost of goods sale -- goods sold is affected by the impact of a better absorption. this is containing our costs, and this has been in our margin.
vebs vaishnav -- coker & palmer -- analyst
got it. and just on like -- well, i think i talked about gross margins. i meant ebitda margin. and in terms of working capital for the full year, i couldn't understand what you are trying to say. could you please repeat that? in a past question. [indecipherable] for the year.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
well, the working capital for the year, what i'm saying is during 2021 we -- working capital will increase because of the increase in sales and will absorb capital resources because increasing sales is important, but -- and probably the stronger component of this increase will be the increasing receivable because increasing sales imply an increasing receivable. last year, in 2020, we were generating cash flow in a moment of reduction of sales. in 2021, in increase on sale, we will absorb capital in receivable and to some extent in basic of inventory, but we expect to be efficient and be able to support higher level of sales which less level of inventory comparing, for instance, with the past.

next question comes from the line of luigi de bellis with equita sim.
luigi de bellis -- equita sim -- analyst
[indecipherable] on the argentina and mexico. how do you see the development of the countries in the coming quarters and 2022 onwards?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
thank you, luigi. well, we expect the level of activity in south america, let's say, to increase slow because mexico will move on but very gradually. i mean there will be no sudden change. even if the price point that is raising, it's supporting the decision to continue investments by pemex and by the private operator companies based over there. we expect in argentina the negotiation of the [indecipherable] that occurred the beginning of this year is stabilizing drilling for gas for the next four years. so in general, we expect the level of activity to be relatively stable with around 50, 55 rigs operating with some continuity. now there could be disruption that could come from different reason, including the pandemic, in this operation, but this is what we see. now when we look at the entire latin america, we perceive 2021 as a more positive year compared to 2020. in argentina, not only the level of rigs will remain there, but there will be some pipelines that will also contribute to an increase of our sales in the second part of the year and even in the second quarter. now there is the project in the caribbean, in suriname, in the northern part of the continent, are very important. and they continue and go on, exxon, apache, repsol. i mean the company are either exploring or developing the different field in guyana and in suriname. this is a important component of complex products that also will be higher in the second -- in 2021 compared to 2020. so the whole, considering mexico and latin america, we expect the market to improve.

your next question comes from the line of alejandro demichelis with nau securities.
alejandro demichelis -- nau securities -- analyst
actually two questions. the first one, paolo, to go back to your volume guidance, yes. so with the, say, increasing in activity in north america, your mills going back to full capacity and so on, can we actually see at some point this year the whole volumes of tenaris going back to, say, pre-covid levels, when you were doing 800,000, 150,000 tonnes per quarter? that's the first question. and then the second question is on argentina that you just touched. have you seen any kind of impact from the social demonstrations in vaca muerta we've seen these months?
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
yes, well, on the first -- well, i will say that activity in seamless will -- in the seamless side will go back pretty close to that. and in 2022, we will perceive the strong, let's say, demand from the contracts in the middle east and from a get back -- a coming back of the offshore because we perceive that the offshore projects are -- let's say, are moving on. and we will see this in 2022. what we are probably still missing are large pipeline in brazil, for instance. there is some moment in the past that were supporting our sales of welded pipe in brazil. we do not see this yet, but probably in 2022 we will see also the level of activity in brazil picking up more strongly. so we are going in that direction. and in 2022, tenaris will be able to deploy all this capacity and the capacities that is coming from acquisition and from the investments realized over the last four years. i mean we are going in that direction, but we will see these gradually.
alejandro demichelis -- nau securities -- analyst
okay, but in terms of seamless that -- you're seeing that happening in 2021 or close to that number in 2021, yes.
paolo rocca -- director and chief executive officer
by the end of this year -- by third quarter or the end of this year, we will be working at a very high level of operation.

2021-Q2,TS,2021-08-05 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q2 2021 tenaris s.a. earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna. please go ahead.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
thank you, gigi, and welcome to tenaris 2021 second quarter conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in the call and that our actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during this call. with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations.
before passing over the call to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. our sales in the second quarter of 2021 reached $1.5 billion, up 23% compared to those of the previous year and 29% sequentially, mainly driven by a recovery in sales in north and south america, but with sales increasing in all our reporting regions. average selling prices in our tubes operating segment declined 6% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2020, but increased 6% sequentially as higher prices are compensating higher raw material costs. our ebitda for the quarter, which included an extraordinary gain of $33 million from the recognition of fiscal credits in brazil, was up 54% sequentially to $301 million, reflecting higher volumes and our good industrial performance.
our ebitda margin was up at around 20%. our quarterly net income of $294 million benefited again from a strong contribution from our investment in ternium and usiminas. during the quarter, working capital increased by $314 million mainly due to higher inventories, which reflects the increased levels of activity. cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $50 million, with capital expenditure of $51 million. our free cash flow for the quarter was negative $402 million. after a dividend payment of $165 million in may, our net cash position declined to $854 million at the end of the quarter.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we start -- we open the call to questions.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni, and good morning to all of you. as we ramp up our activities to meet higher demand, tenaris is acting on all fronts. we are hiring and training new employees as we increase production throughout our global industrial system. our team is managing disruption from the ongoing effect of the pandemic and confronting the rapid increases in raw material and logistic costs. once again, our team is demonstrating the resilience and capacity to respond to changing conditions that is a hallmark of our company. in this dynamic environment, our second quarter results show the progress we are making in north america and the rest of the world. for the second consecutive quarter, our sales in north america increased by more than 30%, as we extended our rig direct sales model and fully recovered the market position in the u.s. that was affected during the lengthy ipsco takeover process.
we're moving quickly to bring production at bay city to full capacity, to step up production of [indecipherable] for our u.s. and canadian seamless pipe mills and to bring online our ambridge mill and the baytown finishing facility in houston. since october of last year, we have taken on 700 new employees in the united states and plan to hire a further 450 by the end of the year. digital integration is a key feature of our rig direct service, both in the united states and around the world. we now have 50 customers using our rig direct portal around the world, who account for 50% of all items ordered under our rig direct program. within this program, we also offer full pipe traceability through our pipetracer application. in south america, sales are also recovering. in brazil, petrobras awarded us the contract to supply sour service and high alloy seamless casing for the libra pre-salt field.
petrobras will use our seamless product, including our dopeless and pipetracer technology in the brazilian deep offshore, an important step in our positioning in this market. the libra discovery and now renamed mero is one of the world's largest and most important deepwater fields. the reservoir in the santos basin is located 4,000 meters below the seabed at a total depth of 5,900 meters. it has estimated total recoverable reserves of 3.3 billion barrels, and the development plan aims for a production rate of 720,000 barrels a day. in argentina, we began offering pressure pumping and coil tubing services in vaca muerta as a complement to our full rig direct service in the country, with a backlog worth $70 million over the next 12 months. worldwide, we expect to invoice around $400 million in service and accessories over the same period.
with these services, we have the opportunity to reinforce the relationship that we have with customers and extend our knowledge of operating conditions. in europe, industrial production has been recovering following the pandemic. new sales opportunities in hydrogen storage, carbon capture -- carbon capture and storage infrastructure and the inspection of electrical grids are appearing in connection with the energy transition. in industrial sector, i would like to highlight our global automotive business, where we expect to invoice around $200 million this year, with over 50% coming from tubes and components for airbags, a segment in which we have a 40% global market share.
to meet the demand growth in this sophisticated segment, we are expanding our component facility in china. this quarter, our sales growth amounted to 29%, and we expect that our sales will continue to grow in the coming quarters. and as we move into 2022, we should also see a stronger contribution from the eastern hemisphere, with the large backlog of order we have in the middle east that we discussed in our previous call and the reactivation of activity in some offshore projects in africa and the north sea, where we are well positioned. the substantial increase in raw material costs that we have seen since the beginning of the year are just starting to appear in our cost of sales, and it will not be until the fourth quarter that they are more fully reflected.
prices are also increasing with some lag, particularly in north america, as drilling activity recovers and tubular inventories held by distributors decline. against this background, we're confirming our guidance for a 20% ebitda margin level during this third quarter. as the world prepare for the cop26 climate summit in glasgow, with expectation that current decarbonization targets will be reinforced with more specific actions in support of those targets, tenaris stands ready to contribute with the investment in decarbonization that we have committed to carry out over the coming years. more customers are asking us about our carbon emission and how we plan to reduce them, and we see this as an opportunity to reinforce our competitive differentiation. i will leave the floor open now for any questions you may have.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ian macpherson from piper sandler. your line is now open.
ian macpherson -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. i guess i wanted, paolo, to follow up on your comment regarding the material cost inflation that will be more fully reflected by the fourth quarter as opposed to the third quarter. does that present any risk that the 20% ebitda margin will just be sort of a one-quarter event? or on the other hand, do the throughput and price increases that you have coming through give you confidence that you're going to hit 20% margins and stay there with the platform to improve next year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, ian. we are estimating an increase in our top line and in the range of, let's say, double digit, low double digit for the next quarter. and we are estimating the ebitda margin in the range of 20%, considering the -- how the increase in the cost of input and raw material is getting into our cost of sales. now there could be risks on it. some of this may come from disruption in the logistics or in some specific issue. it could also be related to pandemia. but in general, i think that we should be able to achieve this level of margin, considering the price increase that we know are embedded in the contract for this third quarter and, basically, the level of cost that we have in our inventory.
ian macpherson -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. that's great. and then i was going to ask also, just looking ahead to 2022, when the eastern hemisphere is going to materialize in a bigger way than it has so far this year. generally speaking, historically, for tenaris, that is a higher-margin hemisphere for you, is it not? so that would be a tailwind for margins?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for your question. you are right that in 2022 we will increase our shipment to the middle east. and in fact, the mix of our product is pretty poor in the second half of 2021. we'll improve in -- going on during 2022. but maybe, gabriel, you can give more color on the timing of the contract and the backlog that we have in your region.
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
sure. thank you, paolo. ian, thank you for your question. yes, indeed, we see drilling activity in the middle east has started to pick up in the recent months. this is something that a positive trend that we expect to continue as the opec enters in the phase of production increases. the recovery is being gradual, but the signs are very clear and consistently positive. we are seeing rigs being added. large projects are reactivating, for example, marjan and suluv, two large projects in saudi arabia, and we expect the new tenders in saudi as well coming to market for demand in 2022. in the other three core markets of the region, uae, kuwait and qatar, as you know, the large ocd tenders have been already played.
we are well positioned there by our backlog of multiyear contracts. this will start impacting in 2022, likely in the second quarter of 2022 will be the first strong sign of this. it will depend on the drilling plans, stock management and also [indecipherable]. so overall, we expect the shipments in the middle east to remain broadly flat in the second half of '21 compared to the first half of '22. but in 2022, we should see a recovery path, estimating probably a double-digit growth in the first half versus this current half, given the contract that we have. in those contracts as well, we have formulas. with the nocs, we have formulas reflecting both cost and market indicators. there is typically, in this regional, a lag so it will take some time, but also, there's going to be some pricing adjustment to the cost situation in these middle east contracts as the year 2022 progresses.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of igor levi from btig. your line is now open.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
good morning guys. could you provide some more color on your energy transition initiatives in carbon storage and hydrogen? and how are the projects recently awarded been coming along? and are there any new projects you guys are bidding on that are on the horizon?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, igor. we are following a number of projects. our exposure to the energy transition-related business is increasing. it's mainly focused on projects for carbon capture and use and storage, like the northern light. this is a project that we will see -- we will be shipping this during 2022. these kind of projects, we are monitoring what's happening in different regions. but let's say, many of these are still in a stage of design and engineering. other area related to the energy transition in which tenaris is in acting is cylinder for hydrogen. we are working and we have -- we're increasing our shipment of cylinder for storage, for service station that are supplying project. but today, i would say, are still pilot project. we do not see yet a massive project in this area.
these projects are similar to the one that we also, as a company, have in our mill in dalmine that we will develop for this. so i would say that the stage of this project is still a level of pilot project. we are also looking in all the actions that should be taken to transform infrastructure from gas to include a component of hydrogen that may require a tubular product or a substitutional pipeline also. but even there, i would say that this is still in a very -- at the very beginning, let's say, of the process. we are also exposed to geothermal. that is a small niche. i mean these are not volume that will move -- will change, let's say, the overall exposure of this. geothermal, ccs, the large vessel for hydrogen, these are areas in which we are operating. and there are also something in the biomass in which we have, let's say, a participation. but i would say that is still a small part of our business. we'll be increasing. we need to be participating in this pilot so to have the chance to be part of the project when they are launched, as in the case of northern light.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. and with 20% margins just a quarter away, what would it take to get back above 25% levels seen a decade ago? would an offshore recovery be required? or could increased onshore demand and stronger pricing get us there?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think that after the, let's say, the pandemic and the impact on the investment, the market is recovering strongly. and the -- some changes happening in the market. today, i would say, is much more based on regional situation. regional -- in some regions, we perceive that the increase in demand is giving us some more pricing power, and this is visible and is important to increase our ebitda margin. in some other regions, the supply/demand balance is still pretty tight, and the situation of pricing is different. so the restriction to trade, the strategy of the oil companies in the different region, the redefinition of the supply chain are creating regional -- some kind of regional fragmentation in this.
and we see that we are recovering pricing power in some regions, in which the demand is increasing pretty fast. during 2022, i think that we will see this trend to proceed when the pandemia will fade out compared to where we are today in many regions of the world, not only in europe or u.s. today, still, the pandemia is affecting the economies in the emerging market, and this is a factor. so if you ask me when the trend will recover, i cannot tell you if this will happen in some moment during second half of 2022 or before. it will depend also from factors like the stabilization of the economy and the measure of stimulus for the economy that may be taken, in particular, in the united states.
operator
our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi from cowen. your line is now open.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
thank you. i first wanted to ask about third quarter, just to clarify. in second quarter, we saw the fiscal credits from brazil helped the margin. i'm just curious if there's anything that might be like that helping your third quarter margin.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, marc. i would ask alicia to give us a comment on possible extraordinary factor that may affect the third quarter.
alicia mondolo -- chief financial officer
thank you, paolo. marc, actually, we are not expecting another extraordinary impact in the third quarter. this was very extraordinary and was something was -- have been resolved at the brazilian justice. and now we are not expecting any more like this.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
great. in the prepared remarks, you mentioned pressure pumping and coiled tubing services in argentina. i'm curious what the aspiration is for adding these types of services, maybe as a percentage of your business over time and how do you think about that from a margin perspective versus the rest of the business.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we're moving in, in this service as a complement to our rig direct. we perceive that the client, especially in the local market in which we have built strong track relation with our clients, are very open and very willing to have our support. in this service, they are indirectly related to tubulars. so in the case of argentina, we decided to move in. we see this as a profitable business. the first year invoicing will be in the range of $70 million, but we plan to expand this service only in a market in which we have a very strong root and in which we can complement a full package of supply from pipes to tubing, casing and services that are related to the column and to the completion of the well.
clients are trusting our ability to execute. and we are doing a pretty good job. we decided to step in, in the situation. we see this as profitable. we will not move in, in the market in which there is very high competition and in which these services are much more commodity. but there are areas in which this is -- could be really complementing what we are doing in service to the client. that's the reason why in the prepared remarks, i also mentioned that, as a whole, our invoicing of pure service with no tubulars are -- the figure in the range of $400 million is pretty relevant for our top line.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
wonderful. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of vlad sergievskii from bank of america. your line is now open.
vlad sergievskii -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you and good morning. thank you for taking my question. i'll start with the 2. so what are the key contributors to revenue growth in the second half of the year? is it volume? is it price? is it mix? is it everything? and what are the key regions that are driving growth? and another one, on the margin progression through the second half of the year, you obviously gave us the reference for third quarter. and you highlighted that there will be cost inflation in the fourth quarter. i'm wondering whether top line growth and, perhaps, better pricing in the fourth quarter will be sufficient to offset this cost pressure in q4. or there are other factors in play?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vlad, for your question. as i mentioned before, we expect our sales and top line to increase in the range of low double digits in the next quarter and to grow again, more or less, in the same region in the fourth quarter. so volume, for sure, will act. price will also have a relevance. because in the end, the price, as you can see in the pipe logix, are getting into our long-term contract in our rig direct agreement. we are, in this sense, coming with a lag. because in the end, we are not selling in the spot market. we're more selling in the agreement. so the price is entering into our top line with a lag, but this will be a factor. mix in the third and fourth quarter will act again. because in the end, growth will be very concentrated in north america.
and so we will have a mix that is comparatively more poor compared to the mix that comes from the international project and especially from the complex project in the offshore that, in my view, will be coming on stream later on during 2022. so the cost increase will also be contained by the absorption. because in the end, the increase in the volume is giving us improvement in the absorption. and we are stepping up activity in the u.s., but we are putting into operation mills that has been idle for more than two years. so in some case, we have additional cost. we are hiring more than 1,000 people. we need to train them. and this is something that we are doing today. some mills like koppel is ramping up. some other like ambridge will ramp up, but the people, we are training the people. so we have some cost now that we think will gradually be absorbed by the -- when the mill will be fully operational. so all of these components are considered, are giving us this reference on which we are guiding.
and as i was saying before, there is -- our risk -- well, the pandemia is a risk. because in the end, we are trying to do what we can to have our people vaccinated, but there are countries in which we have no access to vaccine and the vaccination is moving slowly and in which always industrial operations are at certain risk of disruption. and also, another reason that i mentioned is always the logistics. because increasing the activity worldwide is putting a strain on logistics, on water, on logistic rail, on many of the issues, for instance, related to container. these are issues that could also, to some extent, affect us, hopefully not so much as other industry like the automotive or other that you may imagine. so this is the factor that are having an impact on our margin. i hope that this will answer to your question.
vlad sergievskii -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, absolutely. it's very comprehensive and very clear. can i ask a follow-up question on the u.s. marketplace? how much spare capacity do you have seamless do you think have at this moment? is there a line of sight on u.s. seamless complex being fully utilized with demand getting better? and then what needs to happen to u.s. octg prices to incentivize welded mills to start producing? because obviously currency spreads are very low.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i will ask here to luca to answer. we are putting an operational plant like ambridge. we have capacity that is coming in. and we have potential. but luca, maybe you can give an answer on the two questions, one on the capacity and the other one of when the welded will enter into the field.
luca zanotti -- president of operations in the united states
yes. thank you, paolo. vlad, thanks for the question. now in terms of capacity, we are adding capacity. but when you look at the activity ramp-up that we see through the end of the year, when you look at the rig consumption, rig consumption is growing. when you look at the inventory, our inventory are below the five months. i will touch the cost of steel later on, on the second question. you see that capacity is coming in. our competitors are ramping up. but the factor that i discussed before are going to make the market, in my opinion, significantly tight going into the fourth quarter and 2022.
now as to your second question, which is what would take to get the erw domestic back. if you look at the hrc prices and you consider that this is more or less where, on a level, the erw are buying, you will need to see a jump -- a significant jump in the price of pipe before this can get back. so -- and this will provide additional strength to the price. now how much this can be? well, it's difficult to estimate. but today, there is no spread between the pipe logix and the erw prices. so you will need to assume a significant step-up to see this component of the local production to come back significantly. and this is it, basically. i will turn it back.
vlad sergievskii -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of connor lynagh from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. i just wanted to stay on u.s. capacity. just wondering if you could clarify for us how we should think about your effective capacity trending as you're ramping toward full capacity at some places, reopening in other places. basically, how much sales capacity or sales volume do you think we should account for over the next few quarters, and at what pace?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, connor. i think, luca, maybe you can add some comment on this. but connor, keep in mind that tenaris for the united states is a pretty complex and extended system. we arrived there from bay city, from ambridge for seamless. we have a finishing facility in mccarty, in baytown, hickman. hickman has capacity also for welder. we're arriving there from canada. canada, in this moment, is ramping up also. canada has capacity outside of the season in canada. so there are quarters in which we have also additional capacity from there. and mexico and the rest of the system could support for specific products. so in the end, the -- our production comes from different sources, and we have space for responding to an increased demand in the market. i don't know, luca, if you want to -- or you have some color, more specific, if the problem for capacity comes from the difficulty to hiring people, or do you think that the investment plan underway will be a factor for expanding capacity. can you comment on this?
luca zanotti -- president of operations in the united states
yes, paolo. thank you. connor, well, i believe that you articulated pretty well the complexity and the sophistication of our supply system to the u.s. as far as capacity in the u.s. is concerned, we have, with the plan that we have in place, capacity to follow the growth that we see for our customers. and we know this very well because with our different programs, we know what the activity is going to be in the medium -- in the short and the medium -- and in the medium term. now there may be constraints, and you correctly said this. we don't know what was going to be the effect of the pandemic and now with this variant and how much this is going to or may, let's say, affect operations. but this is not a nice problem. this is the economy -- an economic problem. and so it is very difficult for me today to give you an exact estimation of what this impact will be. but in general terms, we have capacity to follow the growth of our customers as they are communicating to us in our weekly forecasting meeting.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, i understand. yes, i take the point on the global system or the north america system. but certainly, i can infer from the fact that you're opening additional capacity that you're either seeing incremental demand from other regions that those non-u.s. mills serve or incremental u.s. demand. i guess, could you just update on a more global sense? are you seeing the need to add shifts or reopen or accelerate capacity elsewhere outside of the u.s. as well?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we incorporated in the last months around 4,000 people in our system, apart from the -- let's say, including what we mentioned for the u.s. so we are responding on a global level to the increase in demand to prepare the system for supporting the increase that i mentioned in the top line for the next two quarters. what i can tell you is that the increase in the sales in north america are running at a pace higher than the overall increase that i mentioned for tenaris. north america is the most dynamic market in this moment.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
alright. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of alan spence from jefferies. your line is now open.
alan spence -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. most of my questions have been taken. so i just have one remaining, and it's around tax. the effective tax rate in the p&l was very low in the second quarter. i was just wondering if you could talk about what drove this and how you see that progressing from a rate perspective in the coming quarters.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, alan. i will ask alicia to give us a view of the, let's say, the evolution that we may expect in our tax line.
alicia mondolo -- chief financial officer
okay. thank you, alan. thank you, paolo. alan, we are expecting, for the rest of the year, an effective tax rate from 20% to 22%. in this quarter, you see a smaller effective rate because we have many effects coming from inflation adjustment in the countries where they disallow it, like mexico and argentina. in argentina, in this quarter, the congress approved an increase of the tax rate from 30% to 35%, but it has been offset because of the effect of the inflation adjustment. we're still expecting this effect for the rest of the year because we are forecasting that the inflation adjustment will be higher than the devaluation effect. so this is the reason because we are expecting this kind of effective tax rate for the rest of the year. i don't know if it did answer your question.
alan spence -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, it did. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of vaib vaishnav from coker palmer.
vaib vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
hi guys. thank you for taking my question. maybe if i can start with -- we already have on adnoc and koc orders, and i think you mentioned some saudi arabia contracts. how should we think about the magnitude of the revenue step-up from '21 to '22 from those projects? my thinking is that, that could be maybe around $400 million revenues step-up. but what i'm trying to see is like if there are any offsets from any projects rolling off.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vaib. the question here is the contract between -- the change between '21 and '22 in saudi arabia. gabriel, maybe you can pick up this question.
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
yes, paolo. thank you, vaib, for the question. yes, the increase will be gradual during the year 2022. as we said, volumes in second quarter '22, and then also adjustment in prices according to the formula. we see this as a growing trend. we are not giving specific figures on the increase. we said that is on the high double digits, so it will be -- it wouldn't be important, but we keep it there. i would not disclose any more information. also, there are specific issues about stock management, drilling programs that will fine-tune the pace of growth, but it will be important compared to 2021.
vaib vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
got it. okay. and maybe switching to near term. so you guys talked about low double-digit revenues in 3q, 20% ebitda margins in 3q and maybe similar revenue growth in 4q. i guess, from investors' point of view, it would -- what they would be -- would be helpful is if you can talk about, can we maintain this 20% ebitda margins in 4q and probably in 2021, just given the concerns around inflation, but maybe offset by cost absorption, better mix? it would be helpful just to think about directionally how the ebitda margin progressed beyond 3q.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, vaib. i think this is going in line with the previous answer on margin. here, there is a volume effect. increase in volume has a positive impact on cost. that contributes to offset the cost inflation that we are seeing in our cost of sale. there is a price effect. price -- increase of price. the pipe logix is a good reference, especially for north america. it's getting into our top line, and this is contributing to this margin of 20% that we estimate. and as i say before, the mix of product for all of tenaris explaining on the other way. because in the end, there will be a quarter with a relatively low level of premium product as a share of our global sales. but when you consider these different factors are guiding -- are supporting our estimate of the margin for the third and the fourth quarter.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of stephen gengaro from stifel.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thanks and good morning good afternoon gentlemen, so just a quick one for me. when we think about what some of the larger service companies have said about international growth, sort of eastern hemisphere growth, they're talking about double-digit-plus growth in 2022. and curious, in an environment like that -- and maybe the similar question for kind of a double-digit growth rate in the u.s. market, how do you think you guys perform on a relative basis from a top line perspective?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't have here a close comparison. what i see is that, usually, we are moving in parallel to -- on the top line, with all of the oil service company. we followed it. usually, if you look over time, you see that we have been able to follow or to top the evolution of sales and top line of a major service company. now in this case, concerning the eastern hemisphere and the perspective of '22 and the project for offshore that is supporting the statement and the valuation, the estimation of the oil service, maybe, gabriel, you can add something -- some comment on this if -- to understand if this rate of increase in the overall business is in line with what we see there.
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
sure, paolo. in fact, we see the offshore, in addition to the middle east, also on a recovery path. within the eastern hemisphere, we are seeing a positive dynamics across areas. the north sea is in motion. both norway and u.k. are active. in fact, during this quarter, we captured a new lta with va r energi in norway to supply their full needs of octg, a very rich mix, and also services. and as you mentioned, also the north sea, like the rest of europe, will be a leading area for the energy transition where several ccs studies are underway. so we are seeing positive dynamics there. we see also some projects proceeding in the offshore mediterranean. we have just secured a relevant contract with mellitah eni in offshore libya, covering octg needs for their 30 wells. it will start impacting also in 2022 and beyond. finally, also sub-saharan africa is offering some initial positive signs after two very tough years. i would highlight also angola as a promising spot. we have there indications of an increase in activity underway. and this will support gradually increase of our octg and line pipe products in this part of the world. and finally, southeast asia is also showing some reactivation of projects. i would highlight indonesia, australia and papua new guinea as positive contributors in the offshore in 2022. this is regarding eastern hemisphere, but probably it's important to consider in the specific deepwater space that activity is strong in the americas, whereas, today, 50% of the global drill ships and semi-subs are operating if you consider brazil, part of mexico, both sides of the border, and guyana as well. so again, we believe that there is a path of recovery in the offshore, and this will be a positive contributor in 2022 and onwards, supporting the double-digit trajectory that we talked about and in line with the service company.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, gabriel. i think just let me add one thing that is differential between ourselves and the oil service company. in this moment, the level of price of the hot-rolled coils is putting a drag on our welded pipe competitor for line pipe and for octg. this is a -- has a positive effect for us in the north america for octg, but also has a positive effect on our space for the line pipe. because in many cases, we can, let's say, capture with seamless project that otherwise could be captured by welder pipe in different regions. this is something differential. in the end, the high price of rolled coils is positive for us, not only because we also have good results from our participation in ternium.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
so just as a follow-up to that, it's interesting, historically, when hrc was rising and activity was fairly strong, i believe -- and i have to go back and look at the exact numbers, but they're clearly -- it seemed like you generated pretty strong margin expansion off of that and the ability to recover plus and boost margins. is that a potential strong headwind -- or excuse me, strong tailwind to margins next year? and could 20% of the bogey kind of be on the low side?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, in general, you are right. the increase in price of rolled coils is beneficial for us. but you have to keep in mind that, in the case of hot-rolled coils, the market declined much less due to the pandemia and reacted much faster than the market for oil and gas services. so we are -- the pandemia, the slowdown in the investment by the oil industry because of mobility and reduction in demand [indecipherable] much more than the flat product. so we are starting from a different level, much lower in terms of overall market worldwide. but you're right, the high price in hot-rolled coil are, in general, positive for us.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of luigi de bellis from equita sim.
luigi de bellis -- equita sim -- analyst
yes. good afternoon to everybody. i have three questions. the first one is on the pricing. what do you expect from the pipe logix index in the coming months considering the supply demand balance and inventories level? do you expect the positive trend to continue in the coming months? the second question is on the cash flow. what can you expect from working capital for the coming two quarters? and the last question on the latam region. can you elaborate a little more on the trend expected in argentina, mexico and brazil on the coming quarters? and what kind of feedback have you received from the program of international companies entering 2022 for these three countries?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, luigi. on the first point on pricing and on the, let's say, the pipe logix perspective, we have seen the pipe logix rising fast, very fast in everything that is related to welded product, octg and line pipe. and i would ask luca on how we see this moving in the coming months.
luca zanotti -- president of operations in the united states
yes, paolo. luigi, i believe that the answer to your question is an affirmative yes. we see the trend going ahead and maybe improving, given the number of reasons that i tried to explain already before. so activity increasing consumption -- specific consumption increasing, inventory being down, relative difficulties of year value. so short answer is yes. i mean we will see pipe logix to increase and continue to increase through the end of the year and given the reasons that i just mentioned.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, luca. on the second question on the cash flow, well, in this quarter, in the second quarter, our cash flow increased more than we expected at the beginning of it. but this is also part of a decision. seeing some increase in the raw material, we took some decision to increase top percent. for instance, in the case of iron ore for argentina, we decided to bring in a little more, considering that the price evolution was going up. so we increased the level of inventory. and also, the price, the cost of this went up pretty fast, and that is part of the reason why our working capital has been higher in the second q. we expect this to continue to some extent in the third q.
we will -- this time, we will continue to increase the working capital because the market is growing, because the prices are going, because the cost of our imports are also growing. so we will have some increase in the working capital in the third q calls. then i think that everything will stabilize, and there shouldn't be additional increase in the fourth q. the third question, well, i would be very, very brief. frankly, we do not see any substantial changes in trend. argentina is developing gas, need to develop gas. the price of lng is very high. so the government is supporting the development of vaca muerta to supply the country with gas. and this is supporting a reasonable level of drilling and activity.
we even have some record in fracking last month compared to the past. activity will continue now at that level. and also, there may be some more activity for developing oil for export, but it will depend for the evolution of the brent price. in mexico also, i have pemex and the private companies, international companies, proceeding with the project, but without big increase or decrease of their level of activity in the coming quarter. i mean it looks to me relatively stabilized, and we cannot -- we shouldn't expect big changes in this. in the case of brazil, as i mentioned in the opening remarks, brazil is moving on, on some very interesting deepwater project, in which we are present, with our welded and seamless and sophisticated line of product. still, we do not see large pipelines in the past. but the level of activity there is sustained, without even here abrupt change in the level of demand from petrobas from the joint venture operating offshore.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi from cowen. your line is now open.
marc bianchi -- cowen -- analyst
hi, thank you. i wanted to follow up on the dividend. if i take the outlook for third quarter here and multiply it by four, you're kind of back to where you were in 2019 in terms of ebitda generation. and you had no problem paying that prior dividend. i'm just curious if the outlook is any different now if you want to hold on to more cash for whatever reason or how you're thinking about the potential to restore the dividend to the prior level.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the world today is very volatile. there are many risks around from different reasons. this will be left to the board decision in november. they will consider, overall, the situation and will take a decision on dividend for tenaris, as they did in the past.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q3 2021 tenaris s.a. earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, giovanni sardagna. please go ahead.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
thank you, gigi, and welcome to tenaris 2021 third quarter results conference call. before we start, i would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information in the call and that actual results may vary from those expressed or implied during this call. with me on the call today are paolo rocca, our chairman and ceo; alicia mondolo, our chief financial officer; guillermo vogel, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; german cura, vice chairman and member of our board of directors; gabriel podskubka, president of our eastern hemisphere operations; and luca zanotti, president of our u.s. operations. before passing the floor to paolo for his opening remarks, i would like to briefly comment our quarterly results. our third quarter sales at $1.8 billion, were up 73% compared to the corresponding quarter of last year and 15% sequentially, mainly due to higher sales in the americas which more than offset lower sales in the middle east due to continued destocking and lower sales in europe affected by seasonal factors. our ebitda for the quarter was up 26% sequentially to $379 million, reflecting higher volumes, better pricing and a good industrial performance.
our ebitda margin rose above 20%, following an increase in average selling prices while the increase in cost of sales was contained by improved industrial performance and higher absorption of fixed cost. average selling prices in our tube operating segment increased 10% compared to the corresponding quarter of last year and 6% sequentially. during the quarter, cash provided by operating activity was $53 million, and with capital expenditure of $74 million. our free cash flow was slightly negative. working capital increased by $276 million during the quarter, driven by the continued ramp-up of operation in the united states and by higher activity levels. our net cash position at the end of the quarter declined to $830 million compared to $854 million in the previous quarter. the board of directors approved the payment of an interim dividend of $0.13 per share or $0.26 per adr to be paid on november 24.
now i will ask paolo to say a few words before we open the call to questions. thank you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, giovanni. good morning to all of you. over the past months, we are seeing the effect of tighter energy market as global demand rebound as the last year pandemic induced a slowdown. oil prices have risen above pre-pandemic levels as inventories has fallen below normal levels and the opec+ countries and publicly owned u.s. shale operator maintained the supply discipline. natural gas prices and especially the lng traded in spot market are reacting to limit in the available supply response, which are leaving europe with partially unfilled storage capacity ahead of the winter season. this is happening when the sector is under enhanced scrutiny as world leader meeting led to consider how to reinforce and accelerate to adjust energy transition. while the goal is clear, the pace, the direction of travel will remained uncertain and there are many moving pieces around. this volatility in the energy sector, coupled with supply chain disruption and the lingering effect of the pandemic are driving risk and opportunity for tenaris. on the one hand, we have rising raw materials, energy and logistics cost and some interruptions in production dispatch and customer drilling programs. on the other hand, demand is increasing with more activity to support oil and gas supply.
in this environment, our results continue to show a good recovery with quarter increases in sales and the recovering margin. our ebitda margin has now surpassed the 20% level, thanks to increased volume, rising prices and cost containment. going forward, we expect this trend to continue. our sales in north america in the third quarter increased by a further 28% sequentially and are up 155% year-on-year. we expect a further strong sequential increase next quarter as we meet the rising customer demand and pass on the market price increases. as we have mentioned in our previous calls, we have been ramping up our production in the united states and deploying our rig direct service to meet the rising demand and the need of our customers. in august, we reopened our ambridge seamless pipe facility in pennsylvania. and in october, we reopened our heat treatment and training facilities in baytown, texas. production of our bay city mills continue to increase. we are carrying out this ramp-up in a challenging labor market in which we are already incorporated -- we have already incorporated 1,000 new employees since october last year and expect this total to reach 1,600 by june 2022. u.s. steel and several other welded pipe competitors have brought forward a petition to open antidumping investigation into the octg imports from mexico, argentina and russia and countervailing duty investigation against russia and korea. the u.s. department of commerce has accepted the petition to open the investigations while the u.s. international trade commission should make a preliminary determination of injury on november 19.
we believe the petition has no merit, and we will rigorously challenge any claim that our import has been dumped or causing or threatening industry to local -- injury, sorry, to local producers. over the past 15 years, tenaris has realized substantial investment, more than any company in -- any other company in acquisition and capacity expansion to build up a competitive octg production system in the united states. while we cannot predict the impact of this investigation, we believe we are well placed to continue serving our customers whatever the eventual outcome might be. this morning, we announced to our employees in japan that regrettably we and our partner, jfe, have decided to bring to a close our successful association in nkktubes and shut down seamless pipe mill by june 2022. this follow jfe previous announcement made in june 2020, that it will be closing its keihin steelwork where our plant is located and which supplies steel and essential service to [indecipherable]. over the course of the last 20 years, nkktubes has made substantial contribution to tenaris and indeed to jfe, but its closure has become unavoidable. following the closure of the mill, we will produce the high chrome alloy product that nkktubes supply to customers around the world in our industrial facility. jfe will support us in this transition with the same exemplary spirit of cooperation that has always characterize joint venture. our employees in japan showed great fortitude as we made the announcement this morning, and we will support them in the coming months.
in october, we renewed for a further five years our long-standing alliance with sandvik for the supply of cra or stainless steel pipes. here, we complement sandvik material technology with our expertise in premium connection and dopeless technology to include these high specialty pipes in our [offer process]. this is a growing segment of the market. in qatar, we were awarded a large pipeline contract with a value of usd330 million for welded and seamless pipe to be used for the supply of gas to the lng-producing contracts. deliveries are scheduled to start in the second half of 2020. this complements our existing contracts for the supply of octg in the region. it adds to our substantial order backlog for the middle east, the impact of which we will start to see in our results from the second quarter of 2022. in argentina, we have agreed with ypf to extend our long-term agreement, strengthening our rig direct service for a further 5-year period from april 22. we continue to advance our plan for reducing the carbon intensity of our operations. we are completing an investment to extend the size range of our medium diameter rolling mill in dalmine to include pipes up to 18 inches, which will provide substantial energy and carbon emission savings for this larger diameter products. we are also actively looking at opportunities to invest in or acquire renewable energy for many of our sites around the world, including italy, argentina, romania and the u.s. at the same time, we are expanding our sales of hydrogen storage vessel for use in refueling station in europe and california, and we're awarded a contract by air products with the supply of line pipe for a hydrogen development in saudi arabia. in a challenging and fast-changing environment, tenaris is delivering on its commitment, improving its financial results and remain well positioned to support its customers around the world.
thank you, and we can now take any questions you may have.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ian macpherson from piper sandler. your line is now open.
ian macpherson -- piper sandler -- analyst
hello. thank you. paolo, i think that you -- we discussed last quarter that you could expect double-digit revenue growth sequentially for q3 and for q4. you blew through that in q3 at 15%. does that -- did you pull forward some revenue forward? or do you still expect to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ian. i think we should be, again, having an increase in our revenue in this range, in the range of the mid-teens. i mean the market is growing in different regions, especially in north america. so we think we can do this. and i think that this trend may extend also in the coming quarter.
ian macpherson -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. so -- and would that look similar to the third quarter where you've got maybe 6% or 7% asp increase, and then the rest of it would be volumes? so kind of a fairly even mix of volume and price increases.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
basically, this will be -- there may be more different. but as you have seen the increase in the pipe logix in this month has been very relevant. and gradually, this will also support, as you were saying, the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year.
ian macpherson -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i was just going to ask also on the wind down of nkk. can you talk about the materiality of the japanese joint venture relative to maybe 2021 results and how we should think about that deconsolidation after the middle of next year?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the joint venture has made a very relevant contribution over the period of time was established in 2000. and in that moment, it helped us very much to complement our product range and to have access to the japanese market. but then in the most recent year, the overall volume of production went down pretty much. the overall level of production in the range of 50,000 tons per year in the last year. and the current solution were relatively limited in the sense when jfe decided in 2020 to close the site in which our facility is located and spend not immediately, but in 2023, the supply of buildings for the facility, we were facing an inevitable -- we were forced inevitably to take this decision. i wouldn't say that the impact would be material for our balance sheet because also we have provision, large part of the costs that could be related to this closure. the challenge will be and we are prepared to reposition the production, especially for the higher raw material in the rest of our industrial system.

our next question comes from the line of connor lynagh from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much. i was wondering, i'm not sure how much you can really say at this point, but just commentary around the potential trade case. obviously, you've highlighted you feel it's about merit. are there any data points you could sort of point to or just sort of industry data that would suggest or support your position there?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
sorry, i didn't get the last part of your question concerning the trade, which was a point?
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. basically, are there any sort of data points you could point to within your own operations or within the market that would sort of support your view that the claims don't have merit. basically just wondering if you could expand on where -- how you're supporting your position.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
oh yes. thank you, connor. well, basically, we -- in the last 15 years, we invested in the united states a very substantial amount of money in acquisition and inorganic growth. we install, apart from the acquisition, a brand-new state-of-the-art mill in texas. we have an investment over $1.8 billion. we intervene in expanding production capability of the facility of the former maverick and hydril and ipsco acquisition. so our production capability in the united states is very substantial, and we were complementing our production locally with import or product that also, in some case, are solving shortages or our supplying segment of the market, which there is no local production locally, no local production, domestic production or not enough, not sufficient domestic production. now this is our stance in this case, the injury, we didn't create injury to the domestic [indecipherable] on the contract. we are an integral part of the domestic [indecipherable].
we -- this is basically what we think and what we will -- the argument that we will present in defending our case with the doc on one side, and with the itc also for the injury. we have a very strong case. at the same time, we're prepared as needed to -- as it is still needed by a growing market -- by growing demand by the market to increase local production. as i mentioned in my opening remarks, we are now, since october last year, incorporating -- we will be incorporating more than 1,600 people to support expansion of production in our facilities. this is a decision taken independently from anything or a trade case that will be strengthened to give our client the security of supply on our side in all the contracts that we have. eight facility that we are now operating are -- we are operating basically eight facility in the united states. it's bay city, hickman and mccarty, baytown, conroe, the steel shop in koppel and probably also the blytheville tubing facilities. so i mean, this is a very strong, the most -- the strongest production system in seamless and welded in the united states. so to this extent, we feel that the trade case has no ground, and we will defend it vigorously. also in terms of prices, you have seen that the pipe logix increased 98% in the last one year. so in this condition, with price increase of 100%, it's difficult to support injury. also, as you know, steel company in the states in this moment are showing record results. so we will defend on all side with doc on the thing on the injury case.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's thank you very much appreciate the color there. so sticking with the u.s. market, one of the questions we get a lot is what it would take either on hrc, price coming down or welded price coming up to incentivize mills to reactivate there. just a high-level framework thinking about your welded capacity, what would you need to see in the market to really justify reactivating any of that capacity?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, you have seen the prices when come up strongly, and this will drive the opening of plant for welded pipe and no doubt on this. we will -- we are planning for doing this in hickman. the hot rolled coils touching a point, there is probably a limit and there probably we can imagine, if you look at the future that the price of hot rolled coils may go down over time during 2022 to some extent. but increasing prices in the octg in my view will drive a start-up of facilities. still, the increasing demand if we assume -- as we are considering that the rig count will continue to increase in the coming quarter, we expect the rig count as also other analysts that we expect that the rig count and our clients are confirming this view to increase in the range of 100 rigs from now to the second semester of 2022. so in an increasing market for octg with price of hot rolled coils that we -- according to the future will gradually get down, we see that there will be welded type coming to the market. but still, the demand will be the supply will be tight. and in my view, price will continue a positive trend.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
alright. thank you very much. i'll turn it back.

our next question comes from the line of igor levi from btig. your line is now open.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
good morning. so this is the first time in a long time that i remember where your press release highlighted offshore improvement in multiple regions. and if i remember correctly, strong offshore business was a key factor to push ebitda margins above 25% in the prior cycle, and we've not seen that since 2014. so how much offshore recovery are you guys expecting in 2022? and if you had to guess, how soon can we see margins surpass the 25%?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we agree that what we see is that the offshore start to recover. and we will see the beginning in this recovery probably more in the -- starting in the first quarter of next year. it will be initial rebound but -- then this process will continue. we expect that some of the large projects will come to a final investment decision during 2022 and affect gradually also our position and our sales or demand during the second part of 2022 and '23. it will take time. we see more interest today. offshore is moving in -- particularly latin america, in mexico, in brazil, in guyana. and these are the areas that are, let's say, starting to show signs of recovery. but i imagine there by the '23 also other region will join in -- there will be new sizable project in the eastern hemisphere, africa that will come to find investment decision and to execution. so it's true, it's recovering...
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. and as a follow-up to connor's question on the trade case, could you talk about how much of the u.s. sales are currently produced in the u.s.? and assuming your u.s. mills begin operating at full capacity, how much of the u.s. demand -- your u.s. demand that you sell can you produce locally? and are there certain grades of pipe that you just simply cannot produce here and have to import?
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
hello, igor. maybe the line in buenos aires is down, i don't know, maybe luca or german can answer this question.
german cura -- vice chairman of the board
we are all together. well, thank you, igor, while we -- this is german speaking. while we recover the line from buenos aires, let me just say that, number one, we are planning calls for us to be absolutely able to supply our existing and growing clients. as we have announced in the last so many weeks, we have a current plant in place in the u.s. that contemplated the already hiring of 1,000 people. we have about the same number going forward for us to increase our domestic capability. we typically, igor, do not disclose the origins, et cetera, but you need to look at tenaris as a global industrial system, which naturally has built a very important domestic production capability, as we have announced through investments north of $10 billion. and that's also complemented with production coming from the rest of the global industrial system, and we intend to proceed in that way. hopefully, that addresses your point.
igor levi -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alessandro pozzi from mediobanca. your line is now open.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
hello.thank you for taking my question. you mentioned that in q4, you could see a growth of -- in the mid-teens range. and i was wondering, probably at this stage, you have more visibility on the growth in q1 as well and i was wondering whether that rate of growth can be maybe extended in q1. and maybe as a follow-on, i believe you mentioned that from q2 of next year, you could see the positive impact from higher sales in middle east. and i was wondering if you can give us perhaps a bit more color on that recovery that you see in middle east as well as for next year.
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
gabriel, you want to discuss the middle east, yes?
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
sure. sure. while we wait for paolo, i will tackle the second question regarding middle east, where we see drilling activity continue to be subdued. we are seeing so far a mild recovery. the rig count in the middle east has only increased 5% from the beginning of this year. and we are still about 35% below pre-pandemic levels, but we see this changing. we see rigs being contracting and we expect drilling activity to accelerate toward the end of this year into 2022, in line with the opex plan to ramp up and deliver higher production levels. the other important aspect that has been containing our revenues in the middle east has been the change in the supply model in the uae. you know there that we are transitioning into rig direct, so there has been some destocking going on. and also, there has been a gap between the old and new contract in kuwait. so this is also affecting apparent demand for the last few quarters and for the next two quarters as well. in this context, as you were mentioning, we expect our sales in the middle east to remain broadly flat compare for the next two quarters, compared to the recent quarters.
but as commented also in the last call, we expect a relevant jump that will start in second quarter '22 and onwards as our large backlog of contracts for the region kicks in. to give you some color, in saudi arabia, we have been awarded for the jafurah unconventional development. and we see saudi aramco reactivating some large offshore expansion projects. in kuwait, we have already received the first call-off that give us uncertainty on the deliveries of the second quarter of next year related to that multiyear award that we commented a few quarters ago. also, the activity in the uae has been promising, rig direct shipments to adnoc are scheduled to ramp up through the whole 2022. and we're also seeing some interesting gas exploration across the emirates, not only abu dhabi, but also in ras al khaimah and sharjah, very complex wells requiring a rich mix. and last but not least, paolo mentioned that in his opening remarks about qatar with a recent large award on the pipeline in qatar, complemented by our backlog of octg contracts. we remain -- this market will also remain strong for us going to the future. so i believe that starting in the second quarter 2022 for middle east, we're going to be seeing a relevant jump and a new baseline from there going forward.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
when do we expect a potential recovery to a pre-covid level in the middle east? is it something for 2022 or the following year?
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
yes. in 2022, that jump should be getting us back in line with the revenue line over 2020, even hopefully 2019 as well, but back to those levels.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
okay. and also going back to the first question about potential further revenue growth in q1, should we expect still a double-digit revenue growth at the beginning of 2022?
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
paolo, you are back?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
can you hear me now?
giovanni sardagna -- investor relations director
yes. yes, we can hear you.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. no, this is the same comment as i mentioned before, we are estimating that also in the first quarter of 2022, we will have top line growth in the range of the mid-teens.
alessandro pozzi -- mediobanca -- analyst
thank you for clarification. i'll turn it back.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of frank mcgann from bank of america. your line is now open.
frank mcgann -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. just two questions, if i might. one, just in terms of what you're seeing. you mentioned in your press release as you've mentioned in the past that private producers were the key drivers of a lot of the growth. i'm wondering how that's -- how you're seeing that moving forward? is that beginning to change? are you seeing more of the public companies starting to at least marginally open up their -- the spending a bit. and then in terms of the cost pressures that you're seeing, prices obviously have been moving up so fast that it seems to have way more than offset that, and that's led to the very strong volume improvements. but is -- are you seeing something different in cost that two or three quarters down the road start to be a concern?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, frank. well, on the first point, i would ask luca zanotti to comment on how is the different approach from private company and a public company into an investment in these times.
luca zanotti -- president of united states
yes. thank you, paolo. i mean, look, the forecast that our customers are putting forward are still based on commodity prices that are now fully affecting the more constructive environment that we are seeing in this moment. so this may change going forward. as it stands today, we see that the private are still playing the lion's share in this capacity increase. but again, if you read through the large independents, public large independents, you see that they are suggesting something may change going forward depending on the environment. and as i said before, the environment seems more constructive than in the past. and then there is also another factor that needs to be taken into consideration that there is still m&a going on, and this also may change a little bit the outlook going forward. i hope that this helps. yes. thank you, luca. as far as the cost are concerned, it's clear to you that we are living through a period of extreme volatility in the sense that there are major movement in the cost of metallic and the cost of energy and what is happening today in europe. but for instance, in the case of metallic, iron ore went up very fast and then the decision of china to reduce steel production so suddenly in such a big size of reduction has reduced the price of iron ore substantially. now coal is getting up, is rising because of the constraint and the bottleneck in the energy sector. scrap increased, but the net was coming down in the recent time. so there's been some decoupling between variable that we're going together before, so it's not easy to forecast. but for the time being, the cost -- the proof of cost on raw material, energy and logistics is getting into our inventory. by the fourth quarter, i think the full effect will be into our cost of sales. as you were saying, offset by decrease in production and the better absorption. if i look ahead, i think some of these variables will become more normal and we expect that, for instance, energy over cost will go down gradually, maybe after the spring -- european spring, after the winter. so even cost will -- the supply system will react, and we probably have some containment of this extraordinary disruption and volatility that we've seen the recent month. in our accounting, this will be, i think, fully reflected by the fourth and first quarter of 2022.
frank mcgann -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of stephen gengaro from stifel. yuor line is now open.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. good morning gentlemen. you've answered a lot. i was just curious and as it pertains to the trade case, when you think about your domestic or your u.s.-based production versus products which come in from other markets. and i know you don't want to disclose the specifics of the volumes. but when you think about the potential price benefit, i know in prior cases over years, there tends to be a price uplift in the u.s. market if these cases go through. what would be the net impact on your profitability. is there a way to think about sort of the interplay between the benefit you get from u.s. production and the offset from tariffs coming into the country?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, you're right that as in the past, there could be impact on prices. but as you know, the prices are coming up in the u.s. in the last 13 months. months after months, prices were coming up and strongly because last month, it was 12% in the pipe logix. so there is a trend of increasing price. now in -- over this trend, any constraint on the supply side or reduction of import, especially in niche products, may cause spikes. this is also something that could happen. but in my view, the supply is really tight. and the impact of inventories that in the beginning of this year, there was a high level of inventory that were, to some extent, lowering down the increase in the price because the inventory went into the demand to the consumption. now the inventory went down to four months, 4.5 months. so the level of inventory is normal or low considering the expected level of consumption. so this is also something that has a positive impact on prices. so in my view, even independently from the trade case, we will see pressure on prices. and then maybe the trade case may justify some additional spikes in some segment of the consumption.
stephen gengaro -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's good color.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of vaibhav vaishnav from coker palmer. your line is now open.
vaibhav vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
hey guys good morning and thanks for taking my question. first, just a clarification question. i think you guys guided to mid-teens revenue growth for 4q, but did you also say mid-teens revenue growth again for 1q '22?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's correct.
vaibhav vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
and that is despite middle east being flat. what drives that? is it more north america? or what drives that?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, north america is, for sure, a factor. but also, i mean, in latin america, the drilling is going up. and price of oil around $80 is important compared to the situation we had last year. and the price of gas in the u.s., around $5 and lng are also supporting some higher level of activity. so this is driving the -- canada is a factor. and when i mentioned revenue, i'm including prices. so there is volume, there is price. the combination of volume and price, demand and tightness is driving this increase in the top line.
vaibhav vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
that's helpful. so maybe if i think about your guidance for 4q, that gets you like roughly $425 million ebitda. if i assume the flattish margins even despite you're talking about pricing, we can get to like $475 million ebitda for 1q. if i annualize that, that gets you to close to $2 billion of revenues -- $2 billion of ebitda for 2022. street is at $1.4 billion. i'm just trying to -- like not trying to pin you down for a number, but is there a reason why we should think that ebitda declines from 1q onwards despite higher margins of middle east coming in? or am i missing something?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
so as you see, the top line will increase in -- for the visibility that we have. ebitda ratio will remain more or less in the present level, at least for the coming quarter. and maybe if the market maintain, let's say, thrive and there are no unexpected movement of cost, we could also add something in the first quarter of next year.
vaibhav vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
got it. and if i can squeeze in like maybe one last question. this is like a common question that we get on the working capital. so if you look at your inventory levels of, call it, $2.5 billion. this was like this -- if i have to go back to, let's say, 2018, 2019 or 2013, 2014, when the revenues were much higher than we had like $2.5 billion of inventory. as we think about revenues improving in 2022, how should we think about working capital at least in the first half of 2022?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, in working capital, as i mentioned in the last conference, we are increasing -- still increasing our working capital. and with this increase in prices that i was mentioning that is reflected in the pipe logix evolution, we will have a higher receivable in -- also in the fourth quarter. so there will be some increase in our working capital in the fourth quarter because increasing price is important, the increasing cost also. so to some extent, we will have some increase in working capital in the fourth quarter to support the increased volume and the prices. now remember that today, we are working at a very high level of rig direct and our level of service to the client implies an important level of working capital anyway. and then when the volume gets up, also our route in our industrial system are more demanding in terms of working capital because we are activating route that imply, for instance, movement of material from one rolling mill to the heat treatment or to the trading line in different places. so when we grow the level of working capital will be increasing for the receivable, for the prices and to some extent, also for the rig direct and the level of inventory that we have in the chain. i was saying in the last conference that we will stabilize in the fourth quarter, we will stabilize in the first quarter of 2022 instead.
vaibhav vaishnav -- coker palmer -- analyst
that's very helpful and thank you for taking my questions.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of luigi de bellis from equita. your line is now open.
luigi de bellis -- equita -- analyst
yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. three questions for me. the first is on the free cash flow generation. can you elaborate on the capex for next year? the second question on the middle east. can you quantify your backlog in the middle east and how this compared to the previous quarter? and the last question, a clarification on the outlook. can you quantify how much of the mid-teens quarter-on-quarter sales growth in q1 '22 will be driven by prices and how much from volumes? and can you elaborate on why profitability will remain flattish in percentage quarter-on-quarter despite the strong increase in by project
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
if i understand well, the first question about the capex, we would expect an overall capex in the range of $260 million in the next -- in 2022 over the entire year. as far as middle east, maybe gabriel, you could add some comment on this question?
gabriel podskubka -- president of eastern hemisphere
if i understand well, the first question about the capex, we would expect an overall capex in the range of $260 million in the next -- in 2022 over the entire year. as far as middle east, maybe gabriel, you could add some comment on this question?
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, gabriel. the last question in the increase that we expect for the first quarter of 2022, i would say that it should be basically balanced between price and volume. i mean these are driving the -- what we expect as an increase in revenues.
luigi de bellis -- equita -- analyst
okay. so just a follow-up. and why with the, let me say, 6%, 7% of price increase, the profitability in percentage will remain substantially flattish and the higher absorption of fixed costs driven by higher volume? just a clarification on this. thanks.
paolo rocca -- chairman and chief executive officer
you are saying why we are the -- well. i mentioned that gradually, the cost increase is getting into our cost of sales, in our good sales. so there is some pressure of cost. some of this cost pressure, like the energy impact in europe went up pretty suddenly. this will enter into our cost of sales and the absorption this level of increasing volume will not be enough to compensate entirely for the increasing -- the expected increase and the one that we see today in our cost. that's the reason why we basically expect margin to be slightly probably slightly higher, but not very far from where we are today.
luigi de bellis -- equita -- analyst
thank you paolo.
