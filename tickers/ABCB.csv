we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today will come from casey whitman with piper sandler. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
good morning, casey.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
maybe i'll just start by continuing where you just left off the call with. can you maybe just give us some thoughts around how you're thinking about loan growth in 2021? given all the puts and takes with indirect auto still running off, but the southeast opening up and all the hires you've made, how should we sort of think about the range of growth that you guys could put up in 2021?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll take that, casey. this is palmer. we feel very encouraged by that. and when i look at the pipelines, which is really indicative of what the future production looks like; it's more than encouraging as we look into first quarter, which is traditionally a seasonal quarter where you have a little pullback. but there certainly remains headwinds in the economy and pay downs. but what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline and the sustainability of what we've got, whether it be the new commercial initiatives where we've got 10 new c&i lenders, or whether it be on the mortgage front, or when i'm looking at the pipelines now, we've got incredible volumes still coming through those pipelines. i think that it's going to be a strong first half of the year for us. and like i mentioned in my comments, too, i think the benefit we have is obviously being well positioned in the markets we're in. and as a result of that, we feel very confident in our ability to still continue to deliver on the growth side.
and if you look at applications and locks, just in mortgage alone, we're still above where we were in november and december. and it's almost double of where we were in january of last year. so, it's starting out pretty solid in terms of the activity. obviously, refi activity should slow as rates go up, but the purchase activity continues to be robust. and i think we'll see a lot of opportunity there as it pertains more specifically to mortgage.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, got it. and maybe ask one more. just can you give us an update, palmer, on how you're thinking about m&a this year as we come out of the pandemic, it's been some time since lion. so, how should we think about your appetite at this point for additional m&a?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
i would tell you, as we've been very consistent saying all along in terms of the discipline here at the company, our first and foremost focus is always on organic growth and our ability to generate strong top-tier earnings, which we have proven over the last 18 months. we've had very little noise in our earnings over that period of time. and it's really allowed us and the market to see the earnings power of this organization without m&a. that being said, i do think there are going to be some opportunities, and we will remain opportunistic. and i think some of the opportunities that may present themselves have more to do with where we're headed in terms of the economy and where we're headed in terms of needs for technology.
so, i think the opportunity for m&a as we look out into 2021 will be robust for the industry. and what we want to do is remain in the position of offense and be able to be nimble and take advantage, if necessary, if we deem it appropriate for a potential target.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
make sense. thanks palmer. thanks for the call and look for next event.

our next question will come from brady gailey with kbw. please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey. thank you. good morning, guys.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
good morning, brady.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
so, if you look at what ameris did in mortgage last year, it's just amazing. if you back out the msr impairments, there was $414 million of mortgage banking fees. it's unlikely that's repeatable this year. and you had volumes going down and gain on sale coming down. any idea how much those fees to decline this year, what the magnitude could be?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
well, i think that's going to be specific to the mortgage operation of each individual bank. i will tell you, our operation is very different to most. and i think that's reflective, obviously, in the success we've had this year relative to our peers. and i think you'll find the same thing to be true as we go forward. because, when you look at -- and you look at the same numbers, i do in terms of the mba estimates, but if you drill down into those estimates, what you'll find is, is that the purchase activity will actually increase the refi activity, which is a drop off. so when you hear people saying it's going drop 50%, well, that's all, for the most part, due to the refi activity. i would tell you, our shop has never prided itself on refi activities, mainly in purchase activity. and relationships, we've got with builders and realtors that we've established over many years. so i think what you'll find is a lot of the shops that have gorged on the refi activities to the detriment of the relationships with others will probably end up some of those ones that falling out, and we'll be able to pick up some incremental volume.
and as i said, when you look at our pipeline and the lock pipeline, more importantly, for what we're seeing now in january, it's equally as strong as what we saw in some of the third and fourth quarter. so i think the first half of the year for mortgage, for our mortgage shop is going to be less impactful than many others, but that being said, we will certainly, just like others, see the pullback in the refi activity as rates increase. but all-in-all, i think from a materiality standpoint, it's hard to predict what the market will look like after the first half of the year. but i can tell you, the housing market is extremely vibrant. we see it both on the construction side and on the mortgage side. and we'll continue to capitalize on that.
and what really makes our story different too is, when you look at the growth markets we operate in with the preponderance of our mortgage activity. so i feel that, ours will not be -- i think a lot of people are anticipating this cliff dive. and i do not see that happening with our mortgage operation in the way, its setup. and you can see the margin this quarter, roberto and his team does excellent job of maintaining the margin. in fact, it improves. so that's a big kudos to them. and the efficiency too that we have garnered through robotics and automation, that's really what's going to be the differentiator as we go forward with other mortgage shops is our ability to continue to generate volume with less expense, because right now, the expenses are inflated because people are drinking through a fire hose. but as that slows down, that's where you're going to see a lot of disparity, i think, between mortgage shops.
does that answer your question, brady? i know it's a long-winded answer. but i hope i gave you a little color.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yeah. no, that's great, palmer. i wanted to ask next, about the sale of the hotel loans. it looks like, you just kind of took the allocated reserve and charge it off, so there's not much of a financial impact versus the reserves you had already built against those lines. so i get it. but still, it's an 18% loss, on those hotel loans. i mean, do you think that that loss content was real? and are you thinking about doing any other loan sales like that, for any of the other, kind of, covid impacted lending areas?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll answer that. there's two parts to your question there. number one, if we didn't think it was real, we wouldn't have done it for starters. and many folks on the phone that lived through the last downturn know good and well how that sector performed. and the way we look at it, we were able to do very selectively go through and call the portfolio and identify hotels that were struggling. and we looked at a lot of different factors, everything from the nsa in which it operated, to the operators themselves, to the flag, to the -- and a lot of these, as you know, were some of our non-performing loans, where we did not see a whole lot of upside. and when you look back to 2007, 2008 with hotels, and keep in mind back then, the hotels are still open and operating. today, they're still struggling. and we see the hotel sector is continuing to be stressed. and when you take into account a typical hotel and -- business as you have to foreclose on it, just going through the foreclosure process, then you've also got on top of that, you've got deferred maintenance, you've got to do. the property taxes are passed so you've got to bring it current. you've lost the flag because it's been dark. the operator is probably gone by then.
and you look at the carry cost of that and the cost of capital associated with that. and then, when we look back at the, 2007, 2008 timeframe, you look at the losses that were incurred on that particular asset type. if i had told you back in 2007, 2008 that i could get $0.80 to $0.85 on the dollar for a hotel, you would tell me to jump all over it. and today, we feel like we have called the portfolio of those that we felt were stressed, extremely stressed. and do not anticipate any more sales. i think you'll find that there will be others that will be following suit because it's a -- right now, there are some sophisticated operators out there that have the ability to buy these and pay a fair price for them, instead of a distressed price. and as we look out into the future, i feel like these hotels and the economy in general, i think it's going to be much more of a gradual reopening, just as it was before it was kind of a slow decline initially. and we do not see that sector picking up dramatically in the near future. and as a result of that, we clearly identified this as an opportunity to capitalize on. so we did it.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. then finally for me, just looking at the expense base, what sort of growth can we expect in expenses outside of mortgage banking? and i know that will kind of depend on what you do on the mortgage side. but maybe just talk about kind of core expense growth. and then i know, palmer, you hired a lot of talented people in 2020. will that continue in 2021?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
we got -- well, on the c&i front, we're probably going to look to hire about seven or eight more c&i-specific lenders. but one of the things that well, matt and his team did an excellent job of last year is making sure that the existing talent we do have is also pulling its weight. and so we were able to reallocate some of those -- that overhead expense into new lenders, and we'll continue to be efficient with that process. but i do see us looking to hire another seven to eight more c&i lenders in the near future. and nicole, you can comment on any of the additional overhead expenses.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure, brady. we are very, very confident of non-interest expense. and we've closed additional branches in the fourth quarter, and we did have those three kind of events in the fourth quarter, again, that we probably -- we made a decision to make that donation and we made the decision to allow share. so we are trying to keep core bank expenses as flat as possible, especially really with potential margin squeeze and just everything, the uncertainty in the market. so we are very cognizant of finding for those places that we do need to spend money and we need to reinvest, finding a way to pay for it internally through a reallocation of resources. we are still following that same strategy on the core bank. and then we feel like the mortgage banking side, as mortgage banking origination pulls back, those variable costs will pull back as well.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. great. thanks for all the color, guys.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james. please go ahead.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
i just wanted to start on production. just curious, you guys had a nice pool of new hires announced a couple of months ago. just curious how much they're contributing at this point? and then i guess, as they continue to ramp up, would you expect kind of production to accelerate in growth, hopefully, to accelerate throughout the year? and then, just kind of the pulse of the hiring market more broadly. are you guys seeing new opportunities still?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. and to answer your question more specifically; when you look at our pipeline for the kind of the core bank, which typically, we'd like to keep that over $1 billion. i would tell you that right now, just about a third of that is specific to the c&i initiative that we have with the 10 new lenders. and when you look at that particular line of business or asset class, everyone look at it, c&i, by definition is a longer build. so it does take longer, unlike a cre loan where you get immediate growth. so there is a ramp-up period, getting the individuals on board, giving them to move over business and getting them up and running. so we've been very pleased. when you look at the breakdown of that pipeline, what we're seeing is about a 60% of it is still coming out of atlanta. and then you've got another 20% coming out of florida and another 20% coming out of carolina for the most part. but i think we'll continue to see that grow because a lot of the hiring opportunities that we have seen as of recent have come out of the -- quite frankly, the carolinas and florida. so i think what you'll see is, those areas will continue to grow and kind of catch-up with atlanta, so we're excited with that.
and in addition to that, when you look at the seven or eight new lenders that we look to hire, we'll probably be adding those proportionately through those three states. but we're encouraged by what we see. but, then again, you need to be patient when you're building c&i, because if you start seeing erratic growth there, you probably -- it should create pause for you. but they're focused on middle market, established companies. these are relationships, not transactions. and so, i'm very encouraged by what we see. and i'm glad we made the investment last year, because, to your earlier point, it does take time for that investment to start ramping up. but we're encouraged by the production and the productivity we've seen so far. and when this economy opens up a little bit, i think that it will accelerate that opportunity.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then just -- again, you guys did a great job using hires and team lift-outs to do some geographic expansion through some new branching and new markets. just curious, where are you interested? is that still attractive to you and doing some market expansion, is it more attractive to do at de novo with some hires versus potential m&a? and just following up on the m&a commentary, just could you remind us some of your geographic priority sizes that you're interested in and financial metrics? and even if -- what kind of deals you'd be interested in?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's kind of a dual approach. i mean, if you look at it from the organic standpoint with ameris, we are already operating in some of the top growth markets in the united states. so i would tell you what we need to focus there and do focus is, capturing additional market share. then, if you look at expansion beyond that -- of our core branch footprint, you look at where our loan production offices are. we've got a meaningful office in the mid-atlantic. i could see us expanding there and other types of loans and branching, in terms of getting out of our existing footprint.
but, right now, when you look at florida and you look at georgia, and look at the carolinas and parts of alabama that we're in, in a meaningful way, there's plenty of opportunity there. and so, the phase two of that would be to look in some of the secondary markets, and i'd say secondary, that's where we would have primarily lpos. then the second strategy would be through m&a, where you would be an entry into a new market as a result of an acquisition perhaps. but i would tell you that's kind of the order of the priorities at this point.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and what kind of size range for a transaction would you be interested in?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
well, i think, we've said all along and been very consistent, probably anything -- nothing smaller than $3 billion.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then, just on the fee income front, just curious, where are we in the process of reinstating some of the waived fees? and, i guess, how do you think about fees going forward? i mean, the counter-cyclicality of mortgage has obviously been a huge help. just curious, how you think about the other lines. are there anything that you'd be interested in expanding into, new lines coming in? or even thoughts on expanding the -- like the premium finance and just the scalability of some of your other fee income lines?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah. premium finance has been a homerun for us this year, is a very stable, steady source of income. and if you do it right, it's got very low-risk in terms of credit risk. that is an area we will continue to grow. and we're focused primarily on a lot of the smaller agencies there, which i think there's a lot of opportunity to go after that business. and we've got a major focus on that for 2021. the wealth group, which for us includes private banking, trust and investment management. that's where i see some additional opportunity, and even along the lines of potential acquisition type of opportunity to develop there, because that's good fee income. it, too, is an investment, and it takes time. but that may be an area where there'll be opportunities, as we go forward to look to expand upon that fee income.
from just a core service fee income, when you look at the bank and these related to accounts, i think across the board, you're reading a lot of the reports that i'm reading that show that there's been an increase there. and i think, that will continue as the economy opens back up. we all saw and experienced to pull back, and we're obviously a lot more sensitive to fees. but, i think, you'll start seeing the service fee income for banks increasing as we go forward and the economy opens back up.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thanks everybody.
operator
our next question will come from jennifer demba with truist securities. please go ahead.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. and i think most of my questions have been covered. but, palmer, when you think about expense reduction opportunities, how do you think about branch rationalization right now, given you seem to be operating pretty well with the lobbies closed.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes, we are. and i think as an industry, we've all benefited from being forced, quite frankly, to step back and look at that whole operation, the retail delivery operation, and banks, traditionally a very slow to move and adapt to change. and i think it's more of a herd mentality. and i think the herd is moving. i think that will help a lot of folks that have been reluctant to make some of these changes. but when we look at our numbers, and we had a board meeting yesterday and we're going through a lot of even the teller transactions. teller transactions are still about where they were before. and what that tells you is that the drive-throughs are sufficiently servicing the customer base. and you compound that and combine that with digital technology and effective new account opening process and the user experience, that's what we're all about here is investing in that heavily over the next year or two.
because that's what it's going to all come down because if you're trying to divert traffic or customers to another line or a way to come into a company, you need to make sure that, that way is equally is easing or appealing to them as the other walking in a branch. but i think that what we've found, just from -- and we've been pretty proactive in our branching in terms of branch closures and opening the drive-throughs, but i think what you'll find, as many branches will continue to keep the drive-throughs open but the lobbies will remain closed. and then you look at the talent within those branches, a lot of that talent can be utilized for us as we've grown so quickly in other areas like the call center. we've got a number of those same branch folks. they're dedicated to our ppp program right now and will be dedicated forgiveness for that. so i think a lot of that talent can be utilized other places without having to higher talent elsewhere.
so i think at the same time, you can look through processes and efficiencies and allow you, if you're growing, to absorb a lot more of those costs for efficiencies rather than just adding additional overhead. but branching in and of itself, i'm still a believer in having branches, but i think it can be a much more efficient footprint and a much more efficient use. we've touched on earlier the need for wealth management and mortgage, and turning them more into a destination center for an experience rather than just a transaction. and that's kind of the approach we're taking to our whole branch network as we look through it.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from kevin fitzsimmons with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
nicole, i understand that the margin did better than that prior guidance of low to mid single-digit compression. just wondering, if we can pivot and look forward now. so is that still the outlook from here? and i know there's a lot of different factors. i'm assuming that's just the core margin you're talking about ex-accretion and ex-ppp fee accretion as well.
so maybe if you can kind of start there on what you're thinking about the core margin, what you're thinking about accretion contribution? i know it came in this quarter. i know that's a tough thing to predict, but just where you think that might be? and then if you could touch on ppp fees in terms of what fees, how much fees you have remaining? and is it reasonable to assume the round one fees get mostly taken up or recognized in the next two quarters? thanks.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure. sure. so i'll take the last question first, that actually is going to lead right into the answer to the first one, if that's ok. so we have about $41 million remaining of the original ppp kind of round one, about $21 million. and i think that is -- we said that we expected -- while we are amortizing demand over the contractual maturity, which was two years. for all of our internal modeling, we were using a one year horizon, so that would really kind of be the end of the second quarter. so i think that it's a very logical assumption to assume that -- that $21 million or most of the $21 million. there will be some that extend out. but the majority of that will come in, in the next two to maybe 2.5 quarters. so knowing that we do have that coming in on the margin, and that is what helps protect it a little bit in the fourth quarter.
kind of moving forward to what margin going forward, there's several things that are going to affect that and then have already started to effect it. so loan growth, liquidity, ppp forgiveness and deposit cost. so, we just talked about the ppp forgiveness and the potential there. one grows; we'll talk about that in connection with excess liquidity. so, we have about $1.5 billion of excess liquidity on the balance sheet at the end of the year. and we always have excess liquidity at the end of the year. we have cyclical deposits that come in. so, if i'm looking at how do i -- how do we use that liquidity, or how do we put that to use. so, we have about $0.5 billion, $500 million of cyclical runoff of deposits. we've already had about $300 million of that run off in january. we expect another $200 million in the first quarter. that's kind of our -- again, we have a lot of public funds that come in right at the end of the year, and that goes back out in the first quarter.
so, then we are estimating -- we're kind of guiding $200 million to $500 million -- i'm sorry, $300 million to $700 million is our expectation for ppp round two. so assuming that comes in at $500 million. and then, we've got about $300 million identified in the bank and through premium finance. so that really leaves us about $200 million of what i'd call excess liquidity. and that is where we think we have some additional opportunities for some strategic runoff on the deposit side, with either some rate reductions, or run off on the deposit side. looking forward, our -- i think i've given guidance before in our cd pricing; we still have some opportunity there. we have about $500 million of cds that repriced in the first quarter. they're currently at $112 million. last quarter's production was about 30 basis points. so, if we can keep our production in that 30 basis points, we've got some improvement there. second quarter, we've got another $0.5 million. that's at 70 basis points. and then, we have about another $400 million in the third quarter. so, we do have some offensive play there on the deposit side, and we are still looking at -- we have some -- we're to the point now of just some specific money market and now accounts that are outside of the norm. i think our board rates are about as low as they can be.
so, depending upon that liquidity and how we are able to deploy that, and the execution on that deposit cost, the first quarter margin compression we're thinking to be in the five to seven basis point range. i hope to beat that again, but that's kind of where we anticipate it coming out. that was a long in detail, but i hope that answered your question.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
no, that's great. and just to clarify, so that includes ppp fees, that five to seven down or does not?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
it does.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
it does include that. got it.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
it does include that. and so depending upon how much of that comes in the first quarter versus the second quarter that could vary. that could get us down to -- if more of it comes in, maybe we hit in at the three to four. but if less of it comes, then maybe we're in the seven.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. okay, very helpful. thank you very much. just one quick follow-up question. the consumer portfolio, that $119 million that was transferred to held for sale. what is that portfolio? and why was it shifted over there?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so that is -- it's kind of an ancillary product that we bought several years ago. we're funding to a third-party, and we getting out of that line of business. and so we have gotten bids on that. and so it's held for sale. we anticipate that potentially sell it in the first quarter. and that was an intentional decision for us to sell that.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. okay. thank you very much.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
great.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer

our next question will come from brody preston with stephens, inc. please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
hey i just wanted to ask, nicole, just more specifically on expenses. you've all have done a good job sort of growing the core bank with core c&i and cre this quarter, the growth was pretty strong. but sort of excluding the foundation contribution and the fdic termination expense, you're running pretty flat on core expenses.
and so i guess given all the new hires, and given the growth trajectory moving forward, i was wondering, if you could speak to specific things that you've done to help sort of offset some of the investments that you've made, just because you're growing the core bank, but the core expenses aren't necessarily following suit?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, we've done several things there. one, we did the various optimization. so, we closed additional branches in october 1st. we had one additional branch that has closed so far in january. so, that's kind of the branch optimization update. and certainly -- and we said when we did that, that we were going to use those resources to pay for some of these other things. all of the new hires, they really came in kind of in the third quarter. and so fourth quarter, they are -- those expenses are in our fourth quarter run rate. we've also implemented some things on the technology side and some innovation side. we started using some robotics and some ai. we started that in mortgage, and we probably could have made a better decision there, because we did that first quarter of last year, not knowing what was about to happen.
and so that certainly helped drive the efficiency in the mortgage division. not only did they have the increased production, but they also had an improvement in their efficiency ratio because of that technology. so we started to deploy that through other areas of the bank. and then we also -- we've done some -- and i think every company has done this at some point in their history where they just open it up to employees and say help us, and we're going to help you benefit. so kind of doing some cost initiatives there were asking people, if you're doing things, if that makes sense, right in hand and let's find out why. look, there's a better way to do things, don't be afraid to raise that question. and we've had a history of cost saving. i remember when our efficiency ratio was in the 70s. and when we said, we were going to get to 60. then we said, we were going to get to 50s. so it's almost become part of our culture. a word that we use a lot is discipline. and if you need to spend money, let's figure out a way to pay for it.
and then i think as we've also and definitely had the message of, if we're going to have margin compression and the uncertainty in the market, now is the time to really, really look at where we're spending. and so, that -- it's just kind of a culture as well. and just looking at and deciding where are we going to spend our net dollar and where do we get the best return on that investment dollar.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
and brody, echo some of nicole's comments there, she's right on in terms of, we've gone through and continue to go through -- and i think that's one of the challenges all companies will have as they need to continuously do it, not periodically do it, is look at your lines of business, look obviously for inefficiencies that you can eliminate. but, also look at the materiality of what you're doing there. and could it never get into a scale and size and provide a meaningful return.
the held for sale portfolio, as you mentioned, that's a fine portfolio, but in and of itself, it's never going to move the needle. it's never going to be that material to what we do. and you look at the resources that are associated with maintaining that portfolio relative to where we can make reinvestment in other parts of the company with a higher return on investment capital, that's really what we're looking at as we go through dissect each sector of the company. so, i think you'll find more and more activity like that and continued activity from ameris as we kind of go through and find this kind each year in the company. and that's how we came up with a decision on hotels and here we came decision on the held for sale. that's how we come on the robotics for the mortgage. and you'll see that kind of mentality throughout the company as we go through the remainder of the year.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. thank you. and so, just as i think about growth in that core expense -- the core banking expense. from here, assuming that you'll continue to make some tweaks, but would it be safe to assume kind of a mid- single-digit growth rate from here, just given the long growth trajectory?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, very low-single-digits.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. okay, thank you for that. and then, i guess just one last one on expenses. assuming that we kind of get mortgage production to go back down more toward 3q 2019, 4q 2019 levels at some point here in the back half of 2021 and into 2022, would it be safe to assume that the expenses with that will head back toward 3q 2019 and 4q 2019 levels as well?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it could even be a little bit better just based, if you think back to 3q and 4q of last year, we were still in the middle of the ameris and fidelity integration. so we still have some dual systems, and we also didn't have the robotics in place. so, they've done a tremendous job improving their efficiency ratio. so, that's definitely where we expect a variable cost. but then often, we'll see the rest of some of that efficiency.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay, great. and then, i'm sorry if i missed it, but you had a big ramp-up in cash this quarter. i wanted to know some of that transitory? or if it wasn't, what you plan to do with it? just because when i look at the securities book, it's running at 5%, and i think it was at 9% sort of after the lion deal closed. and so, i wanted to ask you envision building this book at all in the near term?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
that's a great point. so we do have the excess liquidity. and just historical ameris, we have some excess deposits that typically come in through our municipalities and also through some of our ag. so we have about $500 million of excess liquidity that we anticipate will run out just deposits that come in the fourth quarter and basically go back out in the first quarter.
we've already had about $300 million of that runoff in january. we anticipate another $200 million. so when i think about excess liquidity, i see about $1.5 million of excess liquidity. about $500 million of that will be those excess deposits to run off, we've got about $500 million earmarked for the new ppp round, about $300 million for the bank and premium finance growth. and then that really raises about $200 million to either have -- if we can have additional loan growth, but obviously be the preferred methodology that we need to keep it safe.
i'm looking at john through that message to make sure that it fits within our credit criteria. but then also, we can -- we have some opportunities from what we would call strategic runoff from certain deposit accounts. again, we run off just about all of our non-core funding. our funding were -- almost 97% of our funding is core bank deposits. so we've run off just about everything else we can, but we've got about $200 million that we could potentially run off or just reduce the rate.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. understood. so it doesn't sound like you feel a need to build in the securities portfolio at all?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
not necessarily right now.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. under...
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
that will be our last resort, i guess. we just don't want to give the -- risk at this point with the rate environment right now.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
and if there's an opportunity to call, too, obviously, because we have that in london.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
that's right.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. palmer, you mentioned -- just on the mortgage real quick. you mentioned the mix of ameris being traditionally stronger toward purchase. and so i just wanted to ask what that mix was purchase versus refi in 2020?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
we were running around 58%. traditionally, we have run in the 90s, high-90s. and so i think that's what you'll see it migrate toward. and as i mentioned, we saw this during the last mortgage wave is that as refis pulled back, and then that's when core mortgage companies like ours actually garnered market share because when people pull out the business or close up shop and wait for the next wave to come, that's where we end up picking up incremental volume in terms of primarily purchasing if there is any refi left. but right now, we've got capacity in terms of the efficiencies that we put in place in the robotics to layer in additional production.
and right now, i'll tell you, too, there's fluid is, the market is, and as full as the pipelines are with a lot of these originators, there's still some movement out there. and i think we've got opportunities in some select markets that will be focused in on to bring in additional talent and production.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
that was on the way to offset some of that run off. and once again, our focus when we're looking for originators, it's people with a strong purchase background, not a refi background.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay, understood. on the hotel sale, i wanted to ask, it looks like you might not have had an existing mark on this, just given the specific reserve for the quarter was $14 million. but were there any maybe at a small reserve -- were there any specific reserves set aside for any of those loans before you sold them?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes, there were -- because there were some tdrs in that mix and nonaccrual loans in that mix. by the end of the third quarter, we had both the fas 5 and some more 14 reserves associated with that portfolio.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. and then nicole, the production yields, 3.86% at the core bank, you've seen a steady sort of -- it's not surprising, but a steady decline here the last couple of quarters in that production yield. where do you see those going in the first quarter?
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
i would anticipate and certainly post that they stay stable at this point. again, the best offense for that or defense for that is a deposit costs to continue to watch those as well. so -- but the trend so far is still flat.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. and then just two left for me. when you look at your customer base, you guys have done a pretty good job on nib historically, but i said like the core c&i portfolio is not a relatively large portion of the loan book. and so i wanted to ask, when you look at your customer base, where does most of your noninterest-bearing deposits come from?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
from -- believe or not, they come from our commercial base, even albeit small in the core, that's what the majority of the costs coming down.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
...which is -- of the growth of what we're investing in here and especially the change in the treasury management side, i think it's for all banks, they enhance their treasury management feature that helps accelerate the potential for additional deposits fund.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. thank you. and then palmer, i heard you response early on m&a, but i just wanted to ask again about the size of potential targets and your thoughts around any potential mergers of equals?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes. i would tell you that same answer i gave before, that if we looked at the target, it wouldn't be any smaller than $3 billion. and anything we do, we've got a pretty good thing going here at ameris as you can see, we've had a wonderful year. anything we do needs to be accretive. and anything we do is to be meaningful. and if you go down the line of an moe type of discussion, one plus one would always need equal three to even consider or something like that. and you have to have the -- because what we don't want to do is get in a situation where we're doing some of this pulling back on our financial performance. so we've always prided ourselves on being a top-tier performer. and so we had to find somebody on a equal mindset that set on making sure that we retain the same level of performance. but right now, the nice thing that we've been able to show the market and show ourselves to in the -- aside from m&a, we don't do m&a. we've got tremendous earnings power here at this company. and if we do m&a, it would be just icing on the cake for us.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
understood. thank you very much for taking my questions. i appreciate the time this morning.
operator
our last question today will come from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott. please go ahead.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
hey, palmer and nicole. just a follow-up on the mortgage margin, i know the comments earlier, just curious if the history of ameris and fidelity before that. if that margin really is not relevant in terms of history, but it's a new paradigm for you, given the changes you're making, which means that perhaps the downside, there's some, but not as low as it had been historically?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes. like a lot of the things, i think, it's an enhanced discipline. i think that both ameris and fidelity have always run good mortgage shops. but i think the focus there that robert odom and his team has put in place to -- and granted, margins are not going to hold, as well as they have, as we know as we move forward. but he has done excellent job of maintaining those margins. and i think as long as the volume is there, that helps keep those elevated. when the volume pulls back, obviously, you'll start seeing margins pull back. but it is a new focused discipline that we have, and we're seeing that throughout the company. and so while there is a controlled in place or discipline in place, it's just more enhanced now. and i think that's what delivers that improved margin and just efficiency that he's garnering throughout his operation.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and are there still opportunities to hire more producers on the mortgage side?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes. so as i touched on earlier, we've got opportunity there. and we'll be making that happen in short order. we've got some upcoming opportunities. so we'll see continued growth in that -- or new hires in the mortgage shop.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great. thanks very much for all the time this morning.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
okay. thank you.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the ameris bank q4 conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to nicole stokes, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, grant, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. during the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the investor relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. i'm joined today by palmer proctor, our ceo; and jon edwards, our chief credit officer. palmer will begin with some opening general comments, and then i will discuss the details of our financial results before we open up for q&a. before we begin, i'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.
the actual results could vary materially. we list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our sec filings, which are available on our website. we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law. also during the call, we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures in reference to the company's performance. you can see our reconciliation of these measures and gaap financial measures in the appendix to our presentation.
and with that, i'll turn it over to palmer for opening comments.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
thank you, nicole, and good morning to everyone. 2020 certainly provided all of us a lesson in humility for humanity. and i'd like to begin by thanking all of my ameris teammates, our customers and all of our stakeholders for their continued commitment, their loyalty and the great flexibility they all demonstrated during this unprecedented year. and what a year it's been. i mean, while 2020 was not what we had anticipated, i'm proud of our team, because they adapted quickly and remained disciplined and focused on the results. and nicole is going to update you on the detailed financials in a few minutes. but before we get there, i did want to share a few highlights about the quarter and the year, and then spend some time discussing the plan and opportunities we have going into 2021. for the quarter, we earned $102 million, or $1.47 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, which is up over 53%, compared to fourth quarter last year. this represents 2.04% return on average assets and a 25.04% return on tangible equity.
as expected, our efficiency ratio increased slightly to 52.67%, which is right within the guidelines that we had given in terms of 52% to 55% in terms of our guidance earlier in the year. for the year 2020, we earned $300.5 million, or $4.33 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, which is up 14% over the 2019 results. this represents a year-to-date roa of $1.56 and the year-to-date return on average tangible equity of $19.77. our efficiency ratio improved during the year from over 55.67% last year to 52.17% this year. on the balance sheet side of things, i said last quarter that we anticipated some seasonal loan runoff in the fourth quarter that would bring our loan growth closer to our original estimates as we said throughout the year in terms of mid single-digits with full-year of 2020, and that's exactly what happened. we ended the year with a solid 6.5% loan growth, and that's exclusive of the ppp growth.
we continue to see strong deposit growth, and our total deposits are now almost $17 billion, with non-interest-bearing deposits now accounting for over 36% of total deposits. as for capital, we remain focused on capital preservation and growth in tce and tangible book value. during the fourth quarter, we grew tangible book value by over 5% and over 13% for the year-to-date period, which is very meaningful. as reported last quarter, we do have a share repurchase program in place that's good through october 31st this year. we don't anticipate buying any purchases in the near future, nor did we buy any in the fourth quarter. but we do like having the option to repurchase if the right opportunity presents itself. as for the dividend, we remain comfortable where our dividends are today and do not anticipate any reduction at this time. moving on to credit. john edwards, our chief credit officer is with us today and is available to take any credit questions after our prepared remarks, but i did want to hit a few highlights in terms of credit.during the fourth quarter, we opportunistically and selectively sold approximately $87 million of hotel loans, which greatly reduced our hospitality exposure. and as a result of that, we incurred a $17.2 million net charge-off.
and as far as the remaining reserve, we continue to believe all the heavy lifting that has been taken place and been completed, barring any further economic downturn or deterioration in specific credits. so this brings our allowance coverage ratio, excluding unfunded commitments to 1.46%, net of our ppp loans. our annualized net charge-off ratio was 31 basis points of total loans compared to 10 basis points in 2019. exclusive of the hotel note sale, the year-to-date annualized net charge-off ratio was 18 basis points of total loans. our non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 48 basis points compared to 82 basis points last quarter and mostly due to the $24 million decrease in non-accrual hotel loans that i referenced earlier that were included in that note sale, $32 million of mortgage loans recorded non-accrual in the third quarter, but have now been placed on the new cares act deferral programs and a net decrease in oreo of $6 million. and finally, the loans that remain on deferral at the end of the year were approximately 2.9% of total loans, which is down from approximately 19% of total loans at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
quick update on covid and ppp, i said on the last call that we opened up about half our branches in the lobbies in third quarter with minimal disruption. but unfortunately, with the rise in cases, we closed these lobbies again before the end of the year. and we really don't anticipate having them open until march where we start seeing some positive swings in the cases. but we've done a wonderful job of continuing to be able to serve the customers through the drive-throughs and digital channels or in the branch by appointment. and that being said, we are extremely pleased to be in the southeast because i can tell you, many businesses here are back open, restaurants, retail shopping and certainly traffic continues to pick-up every day, so that's encouraging to see. but we all still need to remain diligent and careful. a quick update on ppp. during the fourth quarter, we started to see forgiveness and our ppp loans decreased by about $238 million. on the new round of ppp, our portal is open and so far we've received about 2,000 applications for approximately $220 million, just as an update. so approximately 80% of that is second draw request from customers who were also participants in the first round and 20% of applications are from new applicants. so our average loan size request has been around $130,000 for the second request and $30,000 for the first request. and this is obviously smaller than the first round as expected in terms of the loan amounts.
now i'd like to talk briefly about the future of why our optimism is justified. when you look at the challenges we all face in 2020 and then you consider the success that ameris had, it really makes me proud of the company and our teammates. and this year, we certainly not anticipated, but we were able to overcome the core challenges and adapt and improvise on our plans. and more importantly, we successfully delivered on top financial results. and as typical in the first quarter, we spent time and our board retreat is actually virtual this time, but that's always an energizing program and process for us because it allows us to kind of reflect on our markets and our strategies and our talent and our goals. and as i mentioned earlier, we are fortunate being in some of the highest growth markets throughout the south of the east. we've got incredible talent, and we've got good core strength of our more rural markets, too. and this balance is really what allowed us to continue to grow safely and securely and most importantly, in a low-cost deposit environment. that's as far as funding is concerned.
so we continue to look for cost-saving measures to be able to fund the needed technology resources which are imminent. and we're already reaping the benefits from a lot of the investments we made in 2020 from our reallocation of expenses. but we remain focused on core deposit and loan growth, asset quality, operating efficiencies and capital preservation. and these are the strategies that you will see will continue to drive shareholder value.
i'll stop there and turn it over to nicole to discuss our financial results.
nicole s. stokes -- vice president and chief financial officer
great. thank you, palmer. as you mentioned, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting net income of $94.3 million or $1.36 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, we earned $102 million or $1.47 per diluted share. and that's excluding things like the servicing asset impairment, covid-19 expenses, certainly will see and the gain on sale of bank premises. these financial results represent a 53% increase over fourth quarter of 2019 earnings. our adjusted roa in the fourth quarter was $2.04. that was a decrease from the $2.35 last quarter, but it was an increase from the $1.47 reported fourth quarter last year. our adjusted return on tangible common equity was $25.04 this quarter compared to $30.53 last quarter, and again, an increase from the $18.45 reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. for the full year 2020, we're reporting net income of $262 million or $3.70 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, we earned $300.5 million or $4.33 per diluted share. that compared to $222.9 million and $3.80 last year. so that brings our full year roa to $1.56 compared to $1.52 last year, and our full year rotce to $19.77 compared to $18.74 last year.
as we stated, we've already -- we've previously emphasized our focus on capital and tangible book value growth. so for the quarter, we saw an increase in tangible book value of $1.23 to end the quarter at $23.69 million. and for the full year, we had an over 13% increase in tangible book value, up $2.88 from the $20.81 last year to $23.69 this year. in addition, our tangible common equity ratio increased 20 basis points to 8.47% this quarter. and as you remember, the asset growth from our ppp loans negatively affect that ratio. this quarter, that was about a 38 basis point impact.so excluding those ppp loans from our total assets, our tce ratio would have been approximately 8.85% at the end of the year, which is very close to our stated target of 9%. we continue to be well capitalized and we really feel comfortable with our capital level.talking about margin, we previously guided that we expected low to mid-single-digit margin compression going forward. so we were extremely pleased with the stable margin of 3.64% in the fourth quarter.
that was consistent with what we had in the third quarter. and while there were many moving parts in margin this quarter and a lot of hard work and effort from our bankers, that shows you our spread actually improved by 3 basis points this quarter. so on the compression side; we reversed $2.3 million of interest income on loans that were sold in the hotel note sale. and then we also felt compression from the excess liquidity up on the balance sheet of approximately 9 basis points. however, those negative impacts were offset by the accelerated accretion of ppp fee due to the early forgiveness. and again, there are a lot of moving parts, but those are kind of the three highlights that really netted out to that stable margin. during the fourth quarter, our yield on earning assets declined by 4 basis points, while our interest-bearing deposit cost decreased by 13 basis points and our total funding decreased by 7 basis points, hence the improvement in spread.
our core bank production yields declined slightly to 3.86%. but on the deposit side, we continue to see success in growing non-interest-bearing deposits. our total deposits grew $894 million and over 26% of that was in non-interest-bearing. our non-interest-bearing now represent 36.27% of our total deposits. and that's compared to about 29.9% this time last year. we do believe this is affected by the excess liquidity in the market, and we believe this could return closer to the 30% in the long-term horizon. however, we do remain diligent of retaining these deposits through superior customer service, product enhancements and the technology improvements that we've got. so for the year-to-date, our margin declined 18 basis points from 3.88% to 3.70%, even with the large 150 basis point fed cut in march. i think it's key to look at our yield on earning assets, decreased by 67 basis points, while our funding cost decreased by 65 basis points. we feel like we work quick to cut cost or to cut funding costs and our deposit cost.
talking about provision, during the fourth quarter, we reversed $1.5 million of previously recorded provision expense. that decrease was primarily related to the improvement of our economic forecast, particularly levels of unemployment and gdp. and that was offset by increased qualitative factors that we added in our commercial real estate and construction portfolios. for the full year, we recorded $145 million of provision for credit losses, and that was compared to just $20 million last year. our ending allowance for loan loss was $199.4 million compared to $231 million at the end of the third quarter and just $38 million at the end of last year. including the unfunded commitment reserve, our total allowance was $233 million compared with $260 million at september 30 and $39 million last year. non-interest income in the fourth quarter remained strong due to the continued elevated production in the mortgage division. mortgage production was right at $2.8 billion for the quarter. and the gain on sale increased over 4%, up from 3.92% last quarter. we anticipate that gain on sale to decrease back to normal levels more in the three -- upper three range going forward.
net income in the retail mortgage division was $43.4 million compared to $61 million last quarter, but $11.6 million fourth quarter of last year. while pipelines remained strong and we continue to see the strong production in 2021 so far, we do realize that this could return to normal levels at some point this year and we're well prepared. total non-interest expense continued to decline this quarter from $153.7 million last quarter to $151 million this quarter. expenses in the retail mortgage division decreased $4.7 million, while expenses in the core bank and administrative functions increased $2.1 million. and i want to talk about those two separately. so the increase in core bank and administrative functions is really attributable to three things. there was a $1 million donation that we made to the newly formed ameris state foundation, a $765,000 expense related to the early termination of our -- the law share agreement with the sec; and then, $532,000 of oreo writedown. so despite the expense to terminate these loss share agreements, we do believe that exiting them will enhance our operational efficiencies going forward, both from a functional administrative perspective as well as the economic impact of clawback accruals and recovery sharing going forward.
we continually -- as usual, we prudently exam non-interest expenses, and we anticipate minimal increases in the core bank. and now moving on to the mortgage segment, we do anticipate decreases in the variable cost as production decreases back to normal levels. although, i want to remind everybody that there's always that cyclical first quarter result, such as payment taxes. to time our efficiency ratio, we're pleased with our efficiency ratio this quarter and the overall progress we made here. our adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.67 this quarter compared to 55.61 for the fourth quarter of last year. and for the full year, our efficiency ratio improved to 52.17, down from 55.67 last year. the additional mortgage revenue and the efficiency gain in the mortgage division significantly impacted its ratio during the second and third quarters.
we believe the ratio will stabilize in the 52% to 55% range in future quarters as we do not anticipate the level of mortgage revenue and efficiency to be sustainable long-term. on the balance sheet side, and this is really a focus. we are excited to say that we ended the quarter with total assets of over $20 billion at $20.4 billion, compared to $19.9 billion last quarter and $18.2 billion last year. so, as palmer mentioned on the balance sheet, i want to give a little -- some details on that. we did experience a cyclical runoff. and if you remember to the third quarter, we said that we were anticipating that. so our total loans decreased a net $463 million during the quarter. but i really want to break that down and explain that we had expected decreases of $735 million, and that was offset by organic growth in the core bank of just over $280 million or 7.6% for the quarter.
let's talk briefly about those decreases. not to rattle off numbers, but i do want everybody to understand that, that $735 million of decreases were intentional, known and didn't really have -- it was not a surprise to us. so, those decreases included the $238 million of ppp reduction, $102 million of the continued indirect runoff, $87 million from the hotel note sale, an additional $87 million of the strategic runoff in the homebuilder line, $80 million of some cyclical mortgage warehouse lines as well as about $20 million in the cyclical ag line that is a typical fourth quarter event for us. in addition, we had $141 million of consumer loans that we transferred to the held for sale category. so again excluding that, i mean, we take that $735 million unit of runoff, that leaves us with $280 million to $300 million of organic loan growth, which, again, was 7.5% for the quarter, which we were pleased with.
for the full year, our net loan growth was $1.7 billion or 13%. that included ppp. if you exclude the ppp activity, net loan growth was $835 million or 6.5%, which was in line with our expectations of mid-single-digit loan growth. additional information on the loan growth and the loan portfolio can be found in the investor presentation. so to wrap up, we are managing through this low rate environment and protecting our margin as much as possible. we continue to see strong non-interest income from the mortgage division and pipelines remained strong going into the first quarter. we, as always, are watching expenses and are finding ways to pay for new technology through a reallocation of resources, and we remain committed to preserving capital.
with that, i'll turn the call back over to grant for any questions from the group.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from casey whitman of piper sandler. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, good morning.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. i guess, i'd start. nicole, thanks for that loan growth guide you just gave. with regards to that. i think you guys may have sold off some more of the consumer loans this quarter. can you tell us how much that was? and should we expect you to maybe continue to sell some of that off, i guess, on top of the auto run-off, and i'm assuming that that is part of the 5% to 7% growth expectation you just gave.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
correct. it is included in that. so we -- the only portfolio that we sold this quarter, we had already moved to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year. so it did not come out of the held for sale -- i'm sorry, out of the held for investment this quarter. and we do not anticipate any other loan sales. so that was the same loan sale that we talked about last quarter transferring into held for sale, and then it went out of held for sale this quarter.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, got it. and so it's really just the indirect auto run-off still happening to offset --
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. and that slowed our indirect run-off if you think back closer to july of 2019, when we first acquired fidelity, that was running off in about $139 million to $140 million a quarter, that has slowed to about $100 million a quarter, and our portfolio there down to less than $500 million. so we do have that headwind slowing, and we are almost -- eventually going to get down to kind of just that little tail end of it.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, got it. makes sense. and then maybe just kind of a housekeeping question on ppp for you guys. the new $350 million or so in 2021, originations in the latest round, do you have the associated fees with the new originations?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so on the ppp round three, we have $17 million of deferred fees -- $17.4 million of deferred fees on round, where we're going to call around three. and then on round one and two, which is both of the 2020 rounds, some people call it 1a and 1b. we have about $8.5 million left there. so total deferred fees are just about $25 million to $26 million.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer

the next question comes from brady gailey of kbw. please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning, guys.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
i mean, mortgage still remains very robust for you all which is great to see. and i keep thinking it's got to slow down at some point, but, yeah, just it's still feels like it's pretty robust. and any color just on what you're seeing within mortgage today and any sort of idea of when you think mortgage could start to normalize lower?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
good morning, brady. it's palmer. i will tell you that as we've said all along, and nicole mentioned in her comment with the way our mortgage shop is set up, there was never going to be a cliff dive, which i think based mortgage bankers association numbers, you would expect that we didn't see that and nor did the industry see that. i can tell you that the second quarter in terms of our pipeline now we've had a strong april, and things look positive there. the second half of the year is hard to predict at this point. but i think mortgage will continue to deliver end of the second half. but one of the things we're probably most encouraged with as of recent, if you look at our current production, 74% now of our production was purchase business, which is really encouraging. we had so much refi business, all of us had as an industry. so it's nice to see that purchase coming back and with the demand for housing, and especially in all the growth markets where we're in. i think that housing sector will continue to deliver for banks through the remainder of the year albeit at a tempered pace as we move into the second half of the year of 2021.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. the next i just wanted to ask about the continued opportunity to take market share. we saw state sell the cadence now, cadence is sold to bancorpsouth, you even saw it's much smaller deal that southcrest sold to colony last night, i mean there just continues to be a lot of dislocation, especially in the atlanta market. can you just talk about the opportunity to continue to hire away and steal market share versus the opportunity to do something more transformational via some sort of m&a transaction?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when people think of transformational, they think of the immediately a larger transaction. i think the transformational is something that takes place over time. and i think that's more sustainable transformation. and that's kind of how we look at things. but first and foremost, we focus on our organic growth internally and our ability to generate that growth, which i think we have delivered to the market. and i think what happens is when you have disruption, like we're seeing throughout the market, that's really music to our ears in terms of opportunity. and we now have people positioned in place. i couldn't be more excited about the potential we have for the commercial growth too, which we have been talking about and making significant investment in, and that's beginning to deliver for us. and i think we'll see that accelerate as we get into the second half of the year, primarily due to two things: number one is the disruption that you mentioned and number two is the improvement in economy. and you put those things together across our footprint is pretty meaningful. and then, on top of that, if you layer in opportunities, m&a opportunities, i think that can further supplement our efforts there. but disruption, it is good for us, primarily because we're positioned well to take advantage of it, and we'll continue to do that. and we'll do that in form of organic growth, and then certainly explore m&a opportunities ourselves.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and then finally for me, maybe just for nicole. so, you mentioned that you have $2 billion of excess liquidity, half of that will hopefully go into the loan book. that leaves you another $1 billion to maybe put in the bond book is -- i know bond rates are up some, but they're still pretty low. what are your thoughts on kind of when you pull the trigger to deploy that cash into the bond book? is it now or do you wait for rates to go up a little more?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, brady, we are probably, and we would like to wait a little bit longer. we would like rates to go up a little bit more. and here's my logic there. and while we do have $1 billion, again, the $2 billion minus $1 billion of loan growth and we've got about $1 billion left and what we're going to do with that. we do anticipate some deposit run-off as things start to get back to normal, people start using that money. so we do anticipate some of that and we do, are starting to look at some purchases and some other investments. the piece that we're holding back on is right now with the yields that you can get at that duration. when you not -- when rates do go up, we would be sitting, we feel like we will be sitting in an unrealized loss position on those purchases. and that's going to come through oci and that's going to be a negative to tangible book value, eventually. and so for the little incremental that we could get today on a bond purchase versus that longer-term outlook on the effect that it could have on tangible book.
we've said repeatedly that we're focused on tangible book value growth. so i don't want to make a short-term -- the short-term decision today for a very small increase in my margin. if there is other things that we can do, we've continued to grow net interest income nii dollars. so we feel like as well with the mortgage portfolio as we continue to have that and have that mortgage loans held for sale, you'll see that doubled up a little bit more this quarter. we did that on purpose to kind of let that grow a little bit because we can get a much better yield there than then what we can bond portfolio. so as rates come down and we start that may be the mortgage loans on held for sale come down at that same time rates are going up. so short answer is that we probably need another 25 basis points to 50 basis points from what we can get today would be our preferred that we may start buying a little bit ahead of that.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
great. thanks for the color, guys.

jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
could you give us an update on your c&i lending efforts, palmer, and how that's going versus your internal budget and what opportunities do you see in the future if there are more hiring opportunities, or you're happy with the team you have here?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
jennifer, i'm sorry, i missed the first part of your question. it was kind of muffled. can you repeat it for me please?
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. i'm sorry. could you give us an update on your c&i lending progress today, and how that has panned out versus plan? and if you plan on making any more hires in that area? thanks.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
sure. thank you. when you look at c&i as i mentioned, that's probably where i'm really encouraged. our pipeline right now is at an all time high. as we sit here today and i know loan growth is key to everybody's future success going forward, and i'm pleased to say that we are at an all-time high on our pipeline. we are certainly seeing a lot of activity in several different sectors. in terms of hiring, we did hire another three c&i lenders of this quarter and those continue to be opportunistic for us throughout the footprint. we've got a couple of opportunities in atlanta now. and then we also had another hire down in the jacksonville market, and two in the carolinas this past quarter. so, we really feel good about that and the momentum that we're building there, and i think we'll start -- we'll start seeing a lot more of that. and keep in mind too, as we've touched on it, that's a slower growth model with the c&i initiative, but it's more meaningful in terms of relationships versus transactions. and at the same time, we certainly have a robust pipeline in the cre initiatives. so we're just fortunate that we're seeing all this activity it's picking up considerably throughout the southeast and we're going to take advantage of that.

brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
good morning.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
nicole, just a quick question, do you have the average ppp loan balances by any chance?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
i do. our average balances for round one and two for the first quarter was $618.6 million. and when i say one and two, that's kind of the 2020 1a, 1b. and then ppp round three was $146 million average. so, our total average was $765 million.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. all right. great. thanks.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so, i wanted to ask then, so when i back that out, right, you get to, like, call it like a 4.35% core loan yield when you back out ppp. and so, i wanted to ask just the new production yields, i think, i have come down about 20 basis points or so since the third quarter of last year and now about 3.80%, at least from the banking division. and so, i wanted to ask, like, where do you see that core loan yield kind of trending as we head forward for the rest of the year, just given that dynamic?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. there's a couple things there. we do our loan production yield, our new production did kind of come down this quarter. but a lot of that when you think about it is because of the pipeline. and so the pipeline that was already there funded in the first quarter. so what we're seeing kind of coming in the pipeline now is more stable, and maybe even a little bump up. now, we're starting to see some competitive pressure on those yields coming in. we've had a couple of people in our markets and other players that have kind of been out and they're starting to come back in. so we're starting to see some competitive pressure that's offsetting where we really think some of the yields would have -- those production yields would have gone up. so kind of having those stabilized going forward. so on the loan portfolio, just straight loan portfolio, taking out kind of the ppp, we could anticipate potentially 4 basis points. i shouldn't be that exact. i should say 3 basis points to 5 basis points of kind of compression from the loan portfolio. but we also feel like we have 2 basis points to 4 basis points of additional deposit cost savings. so, those almost offset.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so i guess ex-ppp, you're looking for the core margin to be flat to down slightly from here?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. ex-ppp, probably one more quarter at least of some compression. with ppp, we're saying kind of that same 5 basis points to 7 basis points, kind of mid to high single-digits. i'll say there's two wildcards there, really, brody. one is that use of excess liquidity and how quickly loan growth comes in the second quarter. and then the other wildcard is ppp and how quickly that pays off.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. and then just on the growth that you have this quarter, commercial growth when you kind of add up the commercial categories, ex the business lines was solid. but the bulk of that was obviously carried by cre. and when i'm sort of look at the breakdown, it's office, it's retail, and particularly office specifically grew by about 20% in the linked quarter. and so, i just wanted to ask where is this growth sort of coming from a geographic perspective? and sort of what gives you comfort originating these loans, just given all the work from home fears? and then, if you could provide some detail as to what the office exposure looks like? is it like single tenant lawyers or is it bigger office building, just give us a sense there?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
okay. that's fine. so, the geographic dispersion is still very good. and if you think through some of the hires that we have been able to bring in over the last year in tampa and jacksonville and charlotte and been around, and so we've been able to get business and new business in those marketplaces. so, it's been a pretty well diverse market.
so the types of loans, they have been from really mlb, medical office buildings to larger offices, really. but they've been -- we really have tried to stick to essential businesses, suburban, mid-rises is occasionally an ok product, but if we can stick to a long-term lease with a group of businesses that have been there for quite a while and have an essential function in that market, then we feel better about it. and that's kind of how we've tried to stick to the underwriting on those.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. great. and then could you provide some thoughts around the growth outlook for some of your business line portfolios, particularly premium finance?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think premium finance, what you'll find is, it's been very consistent. i think it will continue to be a steady provider for us. so that asset class, we feel very comfortable with in terms of our ability to continue to generate sustainable revenue there. the one that oftentimes won't reflect a lot of growth, but reflects a lot of productivity is the residential construction lending group. and because, as you well know, our inventory has been so low and how quickly things are turning, there's been tremendous income generated out of that division, but the growth won't be there. and that's a sign of just an overly healthy market right now, housing market. so, we continue to see that as a real plus.
nicole mentioned the flexibility we've got with the mortgage portfolio and the held for sale and our ability to utilize that to our advantage. the c&i growth will continue. and as i mentioned, that's where a lot of our focus is. it does take longer, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. and a lot of that is due to some of the new hires that we brought onboard over the last 12 months. and then -- and we're fortunate to be in all of our markets, i mean, growth markets for the most part. so, the cre that jon touched on will still be a very viable product for us as well.
sba is one that we want to ramp up. i think there are going to be some additional very meaningful programs coming out of sba and we want to make sure we get our fair share of that. we've not had the growth there that [indecipherable] have seen, but i think you'll see a continued focus on that, which ought to be meaningful as well as we go forward in terms of generating some good non-interest income. i think that pretty much breaks down all of our asset classes there for you.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. thank you for that. nicole, what was the dollar amount of the seasonal increases for expenses for both the core bank and the business lines? and does that come out of the run rate in the second quarter?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so what we had in the mortgage, we had about $1.3 million of payroll taxes that hit in the first quarter that will taper off as the year goes by. and then in the core bank, we had about $1.8 million to $2 million of those payroll taxes.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. great. and then i do just have one last one. and i appreciate you taking all my questions. palmer, just want to follow-up on the m&a. so, the bigger deals that we've seen, the buyers have lagged and i think the moe types with higher execution risk. so, i just wanted to ask you, have your thoughts changed as you're seeing all these deals kind of hit the tape? or are you thinking along the same lines kind of that smaller $2.5 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion kind of deal bolt-on that would maybe enhance ameris a little bit? and if you could just provide some thoughts on the type of bank that you'd be looking to acquire in the current environment, i'd appreciate it.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
sure. and i think we've been pretty consistent on this. we've kind of said our sweet spot is really between $3 billion and $10 billion. i will tell you, having said that, regardless of whether it's a $10 billion bank or a $3 billion bank, we're not going to do anything that would take on excessive execution risk, nor anything that wouldn't be accretive to our organization. now, we are very strategic in the way we look at m&a. and so, as i've said before, it helps us garner additional market share in some meaningful markets or if we need it or if it provides and helps further a line of business that we're interested in growing, those are certainly some opportunities for us, for banks that are within that space. there are probably some other non-bank opportunities that may be out there as well. so, we're going to remain consistent in our approach there in terms of making sure whatever we do is strategic and that it fits into our overall plan. and i do think there will be some meaningful opportunities out there, but it's going to have to be the right one. it's going to need to be a cultural fit, and it's going to need to -- it's going to need to be able to further our strategic initiatives.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst

our next question comes from david feaster of raymond james. please go ahead.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, good morning, david.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
i just wanted to start on loan production and kind of what you're seeing there. obviously, it's a bit slower than we had in the fourth quarter. still trending below pre-pandemic levels, but it's extremely encouraging to hear about the pipeline, especially the c&i pipeline. i'm just curious how much of the slower production was a distraction from ppp and just whether you'd expect that to reaccelerate back north of fourth quarter levels or even closer to pre-pandemic levels, kind of north of $900 million.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
well, i think the opportunity is for all banks out there right now. first quarter is typically seasonally a slower quarter to begin with. so, we need to be mindful of that. and then second, you parlay on top of that, the whole issue with the pandemic and ppp. i would like to say that we were a 100% strength of our ppp, that is not the case. we had several people that were obviously wearing two hats and helped them out with ppp in addition to their day jobs and everybody pitched into get that done. and it was a meaningful effort. and i commend the industry for stepping up and making it all happen. with that being said, what we've been able to do is kind of take advantage of this pandemic time to bring in new talent and also to build up the commercial opportunities. so we've been out actively calling, i think, when lot of people who have been focused more inwardly, we were out calling. and i think what we're starting to see is those pipelines that have been built, that doesn't happen overnight. it takes, as you well know, 60 to 90 days to kind of get things going. and we're now in that 60 to 90-day period. so that's the benefit and the list we're seeing in the pipeline. and then, you compound that with what we all hope is going to be an improvement in economy between now and the end of the year. i think you'll see accelerated growth as we get into the second half of 2021. we'll probably pre-empt that a little bit in second quarter, just given our current pipeline. and we're probably about a quarter ahead of most. but i think for everybody, second half of the year looks pretty opportunistic for all of us.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's great. and i guess just where are we at kind of in the migration of the new ppp clients that you -- just where are we at in bringing those over? and then, just how much of your pipeline you think is -- this growth is from either new clients coming over versus improved sentiment and improved demand and existing clients being ready to invest?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
well, like most banks, we did a lot of outreach that touched on with this round three, but the majority of most banks' production, ours included, about 80% of it remains with existing customers. the other 20% was new customers. and some of them meaningful customers. they're all meaningful. any customer is. but i think in terms of moving the needle, i have not witnessed the huge lifts that i've heard others talk about. i don't know if i've seen it, and others either, in terms of a huge in migration of new customers as a result of ppp. we certainly have garnered new customers and value those customers, but it has not been -- i wouldn't hang our hat on the growth coming from that, that 20%. so, what we're doing is taking care of the ppp customers, embracing the new ones that came in, but more importantly, going out and hunting for new customers. and i think that's the opportunity that exists for our bank right now with all the disruption in our markets. so, i would tell you that we remain pretty much focused and the way we've always been in terms of our outreach of maintaining and retaining existing customers, but more importantly, going out and trying to identify new opportunities.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's great. and then, just curious, i wanted to touch on asset quality. and just maybe if you could give us some detail on what drove that increase in criticized balances? and then just how you think about the reserve going forward. it sounds like there's still a decent amount of qualitative factors there. i guess, would you expect to kind of maintain the reserve ratio here, exclusively ppp? or do you see opportunity for maybe some additional reserve releases, or you can just growing into the reserve?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take that in reverse. so, the reserve being built off of the -- primarily on the forecast models, as those continue to improve and businesses get back to work, i think we are -- we certainly are under pressure for release. we really don't want to do that. and so we are looking at opportunities that are within the cecl framework to hold on to the reserves, but forecast models generally kind of drive the day and a lot of that. the first part, tell me again the first part of the question.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. just asset quality and trends you're seeing and then what drove the increase in criticized?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. the criticized increase in the first quarter was really just two relationships, both of which were really single loans. one was an alf, one was an hotel, and they were both still impacted by covid restrictions slowed lease-up. and so it was not anything that was systemic by any stretch. it was just kind of extraordinary to those two properties. and i will say, as we look at out, most all of the deferrals we did on hotels were through the middle of this year, which is coming up on us very quickly. so, i think we've got, as we approach that and we kind of finalize what these customers are going to be able to do going forward and whether or not they've reached sort of that breakeven or back to profitability. we'll see some opportunities, i believe, for improvement in the watch list just because we had so many hotels that comprise the watch list. and we're really at that point where we did the kind of the final deferrals on those. so, we'll be watching that very, very closely this next quarter.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. thank you.

the next question comes from christopher marinac of fig partners. please go ahead.
christopher marinac -- fig partners -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. just wanted to follow-up on the mortgage gain on sale this quarter. and going forward, is some of the expense initiatives in the mortgage business and efficiencies you're building into that, does that help the gain on sale far less than it otherwise would?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, not necessarily. but that's a great question as you talk -- as you think through that. so, the thing is, with mortgage, so our gain on sale did decline from 4.34% to 3.95%. so about a 39 basis point decline. i don't know that -- i don't anticipate another 39 basis point decline by any means. but one thing that i did want to add on to that you touched on there was the expense side, and our production was actually very stable. and so, even though the production was stable and the units were stable, you saw kind of those expenses remain pretty stable, even absorbing the cyclical kind of first quarter payroll taxes, but that's really based on production. and so, when the gain on sale went down, our revenue went down, but our expenses kind of stayed the same. so, seeing that gain on sale move back up will certainly help that and then -- or stabilize or move up will help that. but then also, as production comes down, we've worked really hard in the mortgage group, they're very cognizant of their variable costs, which are about 75% to 80% of total cost. so, as the production starts falling down, as the production starts going down, that's when you'll see the shift in costs.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
and chris, if you look at last year's production, about 84% of last year's production was variable expense. so, the key is, as nicole touched on, is being able to move very quickly with that. and we've got a pretty disciplined culture across the board and especially in mortgage. so as we see that tapering back, the expenses will adjust accordingly because it is -- people always tell me how scalable that business is, but the reality of it is and how quickly can you move and should you move. and it'd be prudent that that not be hasty in what you're doing. so, i think we've got a good handle on that. and as we see the production pullback, you'll see the expenses move accordingly.
christopher marinac -- fig partners -- analyst
sounds good. i appreciate the color on that. and then just to follow-up on the sort of outreach from your customers that you talked about, palmer, to what extent are you seeing the account openings that you want in wealth management and new commercial business? it sounds like it is moving in the right direction. just want to get a little more background there.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
it is. there's a void in our market with that type of wealth initiative. and i see that as a big opportunity for our bank as we go forward. in my opinion, it can't grow fast enough because i look at the client base that we have grown, our guys [phonetic] have done a wonderful job of doing that. we're starting to see the benefits of it in terms of the earnings and the contribution. but you know the contribution it can make, and so we've got to double down on our efforts there in terms of growing those assets under management. and right now, i think the market, due to all the disruption, and quite frankly, due to a lot of the scarcity of these types of wealth groups within banks, there are a lot of ris outside of banks and those may present opportunities for banks as we go forward. but that's certainly an area for us that creates quite an annuity. and if you can grow it and grow it in a meaningful way, and we've done a good job of cross-selling existing customers and at the same time bringing in some meaningful business over the last 90 days, that i think will continue to grow that area. but that is certainly an area of focus for us as we go forward. and i'd like to see more growth out of it.
christopher marinac -- fig partners -- analyst
great. thanks, again.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer

the next question is a follow-up from brody preston of stephens. please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey guys, sorry to hop back on. i'm just getting question inbounds from some folks. and so, i wanted to just ask on the, if you back out the msr write-up on mortgage each quarter, it was actually lower this quarter. and i wanted to ask, is that due to lower hedge income on the locked pipeline?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
when you say it is lower, do you mean revenues?
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no, it's actually that gain on sale dropping those 39 basis points because our production was fairly stable. production last quarter was, i think, $2.8 billion. and production this quarter was almost $2.65 billion. so, production was fairly stable. but it was at 39 basis points of gain on sale. gain on sale is what kind of drove that net revenue down.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then the last one is just the ppnr of the banking division, when you look at the segments that you break out, since the lion deal sort of went through, i think it has been bouncing around in the mid-40s, up to 60s and now we're back down to $47 million or so for the core ppnr of the banking division. and so, i wanted to ask, just what are going to be some of the levers that you pull to move that ppnr for the banking division higher just because it's going to become more important as mortgage kind of normalizes in the back half of the year and into 2022?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely. so, that's really where you see some of the initiatives that we've talked about with the occupancy expense as far as leases. we've got some of it there. we've also got some efficiency, just movement going with really evaluating everything that we do and how we do things. after you do a big acquisition, like a fidelity, and you kind of have your cost saves built out and you get through conversion and you go through those, and then you really start looking at everything. one other aspect in that banking division is our treasury. we've done a really good job. we've got some efficiencies going on in treasury, as well as some initiatives there to increase some treasury income. so, that has helped as well. and then, we've got a huge technology benefit. when we look at our top technology costs, about 25% of that is really forward future -- what we think about it has future benefit as far as integration, automation or delivery platform. and then another 20%, roughly of our it -- when i say it, i include kind of our it and our pmo, project management office. about another 20% of that is related to efficiency projects. and so, this is really the kind of all of that coming to fruition and gaining that synergy that we have through those areas.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you very much. i really appreciate it.

nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer

and with that, i'll turn it over to you palmer for opening comments.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
thank you, nicole, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call today. it's hard to believe at this time last year, we sat on this call with a lot of uncertainty about the pandemic and the economy. but the one thing i was certain about at that time was the ability of our team to survive really whatever the pandemic threw at us. and here we sit a year later, and i'm proud to say not only did we survive, but we actually thrived.
we've said consistently that we are focused on tangible book value growth to grow shareholder value. on the past year from march 2020 to march 2021, we increased our tangible book value by over 23.6%. we increased our tce ratio by 4%, while assets grew over 17.5%, and we increased our allowance for loan losses by over 19%. in addition, we increased our diluted earnings per share 29% year-over-year from core operating results and that's exclusive of provision noise that's just pure core operating results. this type of success is due to the disciplined culture we've cultivated here at ameris bank. and having said that, from my preview, i'm really excited to share with you a few highlights of the quarter and an update on our outlook for the future.
for the quarter, we earned $115.7 million, or $1.66 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, which is up almost 200% from this time last year. this represents a 2.26% [phonetic] return on average assets and 27.66% return on tangible equity. our adjusted efficiency ratio improved from 59.87% reported first quarter last year to 54.62% this quarter. due to improved economic conditions, we did reverse $28.6 million of provision for loan loss expense this quarter, and we realized a recovery of $10.6 million of previous service asset impairment. exclusive of these positive events, our adjusted diluted eps still exceeded expectations at $1.34 per share for the quarter.
nicole is going to get into more of the financial details just a few minutes. on the balance sheet side of things, i was really pleased with our loan growth for the first quarter. our annualized net loan growth was just over 3% after and that's after the ppp and our indirect runoff headwinds. we still expect to see mid to upper single-digit loan growth for the year as we look at our pipelines and opportunities within our markets. we continue to see strong deposit growth this quarter, and our non-interest bearing deposits are now over 38% of total deposits. already touched on capital from a year-over-year perspective, just for the quarter, we saw great growth in tce and tangible book value. during the first quarter, we grew tangible book value by $1.58 per share, or 6.7%, which is very strong.
our tce ratio increased to 8.62%, which is getting very close to our 9% goal. our capital position remains strong and it's going to continue to support our future growth and opportunistic transactions. and while we do have a share repurchase program in place, we didn't buy anything back in the first quarter. and we really don't anticipate executing on this in the near future, but certainly like having the option to repurchase our shares at the right opportunity presents itself.
jon edwards, our chief credit officer, is with us today and he's certainly available to take any credit questions after our prepared remarks. but i did want to hit a few high points in terms of credit. our annualized net charge-off ratio decreased to 12 basis points of total loans compared to 70 basis points last quarter. our non-performing assets as a percent of total assets improved 40 basis points compared to 48 basis points last quarter. loans that remain on deferral at the end of the quarter for approximately 2% of total loans and that's down from approximately 19% of total loans at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
as you know, we have no exposure to oil and gas, and we've included additional details on our hotel exposure in the loan slides in our investor presentation, as well as the diversification that you'll see across all our loan types within the loan portfolio. and our allowance coverage ratio, excluding unfunded commitments was 1.29% net of our ppp loans in the quarter.
just a quick update on covid and ppp. during the first quarter, we opened all of our retail branches and lobbies and business and traffic, i might add, it is really picking up, especially in the southeast. vaccines are available to everyone over the age of 16, and they're easy to get. most of the businesses that we're seeing are back open and we're even seeing new restaurants, for instance, coming in and taken over locations that were shuttered last year in the pandemic. so things definitely seen incrementally moving back the business around the southeast. and we're just really fortunate to have a strong presence in many of these top growth markets.
as far as ppp, we receive payments and forgiveness of approximately $638 million on ppp round one loans, leaving [5:51] any balance of the 2020 rounds at $463 million. and we have the new round three outstanding balance of $329 million as of march 31st with about another $42 million funded so far this month in april. we anticipate opening the forgiveness portal for the new round three in the next few weeks. so far we've received over 5,600 applications. our average loan size request has been around $73,000 with the second request averaging around $103,000. and new participants are first time request averaging around $21,000. so this is a much smaller average balance than we saw in round one, but it's helped increase the overall return. and that's a great lead in into the last thing i wanted to touch on, and that's esg.
during the ppp process, ameris had a specific outreach to our certain underserved communities and it was a great success. and that's just one example of how we've been working diligently on our esg initiatives. in march 2020, we established our first chief governance officer role, and then shortly thereafter announced our first diversity officer, karlene gordon. we have a management level esg committee and that meets regularly and we report to the board. and we're actually preparing our first corporate social responsibility report or csr as they call it. and we hope to have that out in public in the near-end of the second quarter. so we can share that with all our investors to show them everything we're doing on that front.
but i'll stop there and then i'll turn it over to nicole to discuss our financial results.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thank you, palmer. as you stated, for the first quarter, we earned a record $125 million, or $1.79 per diluted share. we reversed $28.6 million of provision for credit loss expense during the quarter due to those improving economic conditions. on an adjusted basis, we earned $115.7 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, when you exclude the recovery on the servicing asset impairment, the gain on boli and also the gain on sale of premises. so because there's been so much of the volatility in the provision, i thought i'd mentioned some pre-tax pre-provision adjusted numbers, where we earned $123.6 [phonetic] million for the quarter compared to $89.4 million first quarter of last year, again, kind of taking out that provision noise that represents a 37% increase year-over-year from true core operating performance. and that's a direct result of the culture of discipline and focus that we've been talking about since the fidelity acquisition.
our adjusted return on assets in the first quarter was 2.26%, which was an increase from the 2.04% reported last quarter and 87 basis points reported this time last year. our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 27.66% compared to 25.04% last quarter and 10.98% first quarter last year. those increases in these ratios are due to the reverse provision for credit loss expense described above. however, excluding the reversal of provision in the msr recovery, our core roa was still were very robust at 1.83% [phonetic] for the quarter.
as palmer mentioned, tangible book value, we've remained focused on, that increased by $1.58 or 6.7% for the quarter from $23.69 to $25.27. for the year over the year, we increased that by $4.83, or 23.6% from the $20.44 [phonetic] that it was this time last year. in addition, our tangible common equity ratio increased 15 basis points to 8.62% from 8.47% at the end of the year. the ppp loans and approximately $2 billion of excess liquidity in our balance sheet negatively impacted this ratio by 129 basis points. so excluding the ppp loans and the excess cash from total assets, our tce here would have been approximately 9.9% at quarter end, which is well above our stated target of 9%. having said that, you can see that we continue to be well capitalized and we feel comfortable with our capital and our dividend level.
moving on to margin. as expected, our net interest margin declined by 7 basis points from 3.64% to 3.57% during the quarter. our yield on earning assets declined by 13 basis points, while our total funding cost decreased 6 basis points, but our total interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 9 basis points. the approximate $2 billion of excess liquidity in our balance sheet negatively affected our margin by 24 basis points. those 24 basis points were offset by the increase in yield on loans both held for sale and investment including ppp accretion for that net decline of 13 basis points that i previously mentioned.
we continue to stay focused on our deposit costs. but the real driver to an improving margin going forward is putting that excess liquidity to work, which we anticipate occurring over the next three quarters. we've already mentioned that we reversed the $28.6 million of provision expense for the quarter due to improvement in the economy, particularly our economic forecast related to unemployment and gdp and the cre index.
we continue to carry qualitative factors on various segments of our portfolio to include commercial real estate mortgage and hotels. our ending allowance for loan loss was $178.6 million compared to $199.4 million at the end of the year and $149.5 million at the end of the first quarter last year with the pandemic has just begun. including the unfunded commitment reserve and allowance for other credit losses, our total allowance for credit losses of $200.2 million at quarter end compared to $233.1 million at the end of the year and $167.3 million at march of last year.
non-interest income remained strong this quarter due to the continued elevated production in the mortgage division, kind of taking out the msr noise of an impairment prior quarters and the recovery this quarter. and then the non-recurring gain on boli, that's also a non-interest income. if you take out all that noise, non-interest income increased 39% from first quarter last year to first quarter of this year.
mortgage production was right at $2.6 billion for the quarter compared to $2.8 billion last quarter. and the gain on sale decreased to 3.95% compared to 4.34% last quarter. the open pipeline at the end of the quarter was 16% higher than at the end of the year, finishing at $2.3 billion compared to even $2 billion at year-end. while we do see production slowing later in the year, kind of quote palmer from last quarter, we really don't foresee a cliff dive there. but we do continue to monitor it.
moving on to expenses. total non-interest expense continue to decline this quarter from $151 million last quarter to $148.8 million, almost $149 million this quarter. last quarter, i guided that we would continue to prudently exam non-interest expense and anticipated minimal increases in the core bank. so i was really pleased with our efforts here this quarter and our determination to find ways to pay for new initiative. as a result, expenses in the banking division declined $2.3 million during the quarter, and our efficiency ratio in that division improved by over 200 basis points. we continue to watch efficiency -- efficiency ratio by division, very, very closely.
overall for the company, our adjusted efficiency ratio increased this quarter to 54.62% from the 52.67% last quarter, but declined from the 59.87% reported this time last year. i previously guided for the efficiency ratio to stabilize in the 53% to 55% range, because we really don't anticipate the previous level of mortgage revenue and efficiency to be sustainable. so we came in right in line with that guidance. however, we do continue to monitor the variable cost in the mortgage division and we anticipate those reducing down as production declines in the second half of the year.
on the balance sheet side, we ended the quarter with assets of $21.4 billion, compared to $20.4 billion at year-end. we were pleased with our organic loan growth of $118.9 million or 3.3% annualized for the quarter. as you can see on slide 14 in our slide deck, we had about $294 million of headwind against significant growth in cre, residential and our new c&i division. we believe the decline in c&d and warehouse lines are could be cyclical and we could see further growth over the remainder of the year, although we are watching this warehouse lines to determine it's actually cyclical or that's the beginning of the trend.
we already discussed the excess liquidity that you can see in the other earning assets on the balance sheet due to the tremendous deposit growth this quarter. we grew deposits $918 million or 22% annualized, and over 71% of that deposit growth was in non-interest bearing deposits. while we did have the expected seasonal runoff, we also had approximately $900 million in extra ppp funds and stimulus money came in. so now the real question is, how fast can we put that liquidity to work? we continue to anticipate net loan growth, net of ppp activity for the year in the mid single-digits, kind of that 5% to 7% range, which is about $1 billion of growth. so that $2 billion of excess liquidity, we've got $1 billion going into loans, and that leaves about $1 billion of excess cash to prepare for any deposit run-off that we might see from that ppp funds being deployed or the stimulus money being used. and also as we begin to buy investments as rates become more appealing.
so to wrap up, we're excited about the remainder of 2021. some of the best markets in the southeast, life is getting back to normal and businesses are starting to grow. we're protecting our margin as much as possible and we're ready to utilize this excess liquidity to fund loan growth. mortgage and fee income remained strong, and expense control is as always part of our company's dna.
i appreciate everyone's time today. and with that, i'll turn the call back over to andrea to open up the q&a session. thank you, andrea.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from brady gailey with kbw. please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning guys.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
so when i look at what happened on the expense side, basically your ability to reduce expenses to help offset the pressure of down revenue and mostly down mortgage, that was pretty impressive in the second quarter. i mean should that dynamic continue to play out like it did in 2q going forward as mortgage continues to normalize.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
so brady, i'm going to take that question and split it into two, if that's ok and talk about the mortgage side and then talk about the banking side because i think there's two different dynamics there. on the mortgage side, we do anticipate and again kind of looking at mortgage revenue driven by gain on sale and the other component is production and the gain margin really doesn't affect those variable costs and we feel like we've absorbed all of that into the second quarter. then when you turn to the production side, the production side is where the variable costs really are affected. we have about an 80% structure there. so as production comes down, we expect additional cost saves on the expense side, that's mostly in salaries benefits, basically commissions incentive and then also on the it side because as production comes down, your data processing per account comes down. so those are the two main categories on the build-out kind of 80% decline in expenses as the production revenue comes down. so, i do anticipate on the mortgage side.
on the banking side, part of the decrease this quarter had to do with deferred costs because of our very strong production. so i think some of that could come back. i don't think that we'll go back to the 83, 85 [phonetic] that we were running, but i think the 76 [phonetic] could easily up a little bit as that -- as production, again very robust and you think about third, fourth quarters if it is not quite as robust production, this deferred fees could impact that. so i think the 76 [phonetic] could easily go closer to the 79 to 80 [phonetic], but i don't anticipate it going as high as it was in that 85 [phonetic] range a few quarters ago.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay and then when i look at your capital base, i mean nicole, you mentioned that adjusted tce is 10%. that's a 100 basis points above your 9% target. your stock has pulled back a little bit here. it's at 11 times earnings and only 1.7 times tangible, which is pretty attractive. any thoughts on reengaging in the share buyback?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah, brady. this is palmer, as you know, we've got the plan out there and authorized and we've got opportunities to do that and if we continue to see the pullback that we're seeing now, because the stock is at a very attractive price, that's certainly a consideration we'll take into consideration.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay and then finally from me, maybe just an update on m&a. we saw southstate enter your market in a big way this morning with the acquisition of atlanta capital. would a target like that possibly have been of interest to you? and then just generally speaking, maybe update on how you guys are thinking about m&a now, palmer?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah, no, i think that's a nice transaction for southstate. i think it's a good bolt-on for them. i think that it's -- whenever you can garner market share in a market like atlanta, i think it's a good opportunity and i think that the opportunity for a lot of folks looking at atlanta as they realize the opportunity here in terms of the growth prospects and that's what we'll continue to capitalize on and when you look at where we stand in the market in terms of market share and in the existing platform we have in place, we'll be able to lever that in a meaningful way.
in terms of our outlook, we're pretty consistent in terms of what we're looking for. we've got -- we're very disciplined and obviously very principled in what we want to do. so we take a lot of the social considerations into account in addition to the pricing and so we're going to remain opportunistic, which is where we are and it's nice to be in a position to be able to think that way, but aside from m&a, as you know, we've got incredible growth -- organic growth opportunities and we'll continue to pursue those either way.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the color, guys.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
you bet.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, brady.

your next question comes from casey whitman with piper sandler. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
nicole, maybe can you walk us through how you are thinking about your core margin over the back half of the year without ppp and accretion. and obviously, how liquidity is going to play into that?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely, so i was going to say excluding kind of just assuming flat ppp, flat accretion, and flat liquidity, we're guiding for another quarter of mid-single digit compression. that's a couple of basis points on the asset side offset. we do think we have a couple more basis points to squeeze out on the deposit side mostly in that cd portfolio. so again kind of mid-single digit compression for the next quarter until we start to stabilize.
again, we have that $2.5 billion of excess liquidity. so as we can start deploying that, every $100 million is about 2 basis points on our margin. so as soon as we start deploying that, we will definitely see the pickup on -- have that added back in, but assuming the liquidity stays flat, accretion and ppp stay flat, we're mid-single digit compression for one more quarter.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, makes sense. that's all i had. nice quarter.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great, thank you, casey.

the next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities. please go ahead. is the line muted? we can't hear you.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, can you hear me now?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, good morning, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, how are you? my question is on the mortgage business. can you just talk about what kind of production trends you think you're going to see over the next couple of quarters and how much of an issue is the inventory shortage right now?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll take that. i think when you look at our current production and you saw it this quarter, it's still very meaningful. obviously, we're impacted by the margin, but in terms of the impact from a supply situation, what we're finding is that while supply is in short order, the demand is still there and typically in this business, you've got a lot of seasonality for the second half of the year and i don't think you're going to see that.
so i think what's going to happen is, it's actually going to be when you look at the run rate going forward over the next probably two to four quarters, i think it's going to be actually much more stable than what we have historically seen just because that constant demand for inventory and for absorption, which we normally see a pullback as we get into -- later into the year.
so i'm kind of contrarian in that view and think that in certain markets as we all know there is a very high shortage of supply, but the absorption is there and so i think it's going to continue to be a steady performer for those that are heavily focused on purchase type activity, which we are, with builder and realtors. so i think that's going to serve us well. we certainly all saw a little pickup in the refi activity just due to the drop in rates over the last quarter, but going forward, i think it's going to be a much more stable type of environment for mortgage quite frankly for those that are heavy purchase oriented.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay and back on the merger interest topic, palmer. could you just give us a little more detail on what types of transactions ameris might be interested in if they make sense?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah, i would tell you, those are the kinds of transactions we're looking at, anything that makes sense to us. we're big on culture as you know here. so it has got to be a very good cultural fit and alignment there and it's got to be accretive. we're very disciplined in our pricing. we're not going to do anything that's overly dilutive to this company or to our shareholders, but first and foremost, it's got to be a good cultural fit and so we will remain like i said opportunistic and open to other opportunities that are out there both bank and non-bank type of transactions.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, thank you.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc. please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, brody.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey nicole, could you just help me around the core expenses, so i hear you that you think you can bump back up to $79 million or $80 million with the production, but just when i look at the year-over-year sort of decline understanding that 1q is a seasonally high, a seasonal high for you guys because of the payroll, but you know, you're down from $83 million year-over-year to $76 millino, right, so you know, you're effectively taken out $7 million out of the quarterly run rate on a year-over-year basis. and so just help me understand how you -- like what specifically has driven that level of the decline in the core bank expenses over the last year while you've been actively hiring people?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, that's a great question. i appreciate it. and so this really comes back to what we've been saying for several quarters is that we feel like we've been ahead of the curve on a few things. we did our branch rationalization and then close branches there. we were looking at lease opportunities as leases were expiring to move out of those and kind of consolidate spaces and so that's -- it's been exactly what we had planned and we have been able to do hiring.
i will say that we have certainly used and i know people are heard me [phonetic] saying there's a reallocation of resources, but finding ways to pay for things and so even though we have had new hires, we've also had some attrition or some retirements and maybe we've reallocated those funds to be able to move into some other growth markets and not fill those positions in some of our other markets.
and then we've also started using technology to help as well and so when you look at the expense down the line, it's just about every bucket. i mean you'll see data processing and telecommunications is about the only one that's been flat there, but some of the expenses that we spent there have been able to help us in some of the other non-interest expenses that are down. occupancy is down as well as salaries and employee benefits. and you are exactly right, we had about a $1 million to $2 million payroll tax in the first quarter that we didn't have again and then we also had those deferred costs that could come back up into that salary category.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
but brody, this is palmer. one thing in all companies, obviously, the largest expense item is the teammaters and the overhead and i think what i've been very pleased with the ameris team here is the discipline in terms of accountability and expectations and being realistic about it obviously, but what you'll find a good example is even in our commercial banking group, year-to-date, we've hired 11 new individuals, but net that we were only up three ftes and i think what that's reflective of is just holding people accountable for their roles and their performance and if you can do that throughout an entire company whether it's on the operational side or on the production side, what you end up with is a very meaningful group of high performing individuals and instead of just layering in additional expense to mask a deficiency and so i think that's one of the things that we've been very consequential about this year and last year and it's certainly paid dividends for us currently and going forward.
operator
brody, do you have any more questions? we can't hear you.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
oh yes, sorry about that. so i guess on the mortgage side, nicole, just one last question there. if 80% of the expense there is tied to variable comp, if production were down say 5% again next quarter, that means expenses in that business line should be down 4%. is that how should i be thinking about that?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
exactly, yes.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. great, thanks for that. and i guess maybe just on that, for the mortgage banking, is that tied to total production or is that, or are those expenses tied to sold production?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
total production.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, all right, great. thanks for that clarification. maybe just switching to core loan yields. i think backing out ppp and sort of calculating your core loan yield right around 4.25% this quarter, which is down about 10 basis points from last quarter. just given that new production yields continue to head down by 5 bps to 6 bps per quarter here, should we expect a similar kind of decrease in that core loan yields over the next couple of quarters or i guess when do you sort of expect that to subside?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, you're exactly right. so with our current come on [phonetic] rate, it is pushing our loan yields down and so we really need about a 50 basis point upswing for that to stabilize. so, if rates stay where they are for long periods, we could continue to see some of that compression. again, we have the deposit side to help some of that for sure, but again, we kind of need a 50 basis point swing to really stop that margin decline and anything above that would start to be accretive.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay and in the hfs portfolio 77 [phonetic] yield. is that a good normalized yield to use going forward. i know it can be pretty variable?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
it is pretty variable. i hate to say this, but i don't anticipate it going down. so i think you could probably use that and that was being conservative.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay and on that hfs portfolio, nicole, the pipelines being down this quarter and mba forecast being what they are, i guess we should expect this hfs portfolio continue to leg down from here. and so would you kind of expect it to get back to that $800 million range by some point next year?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would say that that we've kind of guided to $900 million to $1 billion is kind of what we think will be the new norm. so it still has a couple of $100 million to come down, yes.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay and then just on the mortgage banking division again, just could you help me understand some of the variability that you see on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the provision line item there. sort of what drives that. is it related to the average loans that you like are in the hfs portfolio or what are the specific components there that drive that?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, some of that is related to how we allocate the provision and so when we start looking at some internal credit metrics similar to -- such as deferrals or delinquencies and then also just when we look at overall general economic factors, we could have some shift between buckets. so you'll see i think what you're looking at is again, when you again look at last quarter, that $4.5 million, we had a $28 million release for the whole company. so some of that was allocated to mortgage and then this quarter, you'll see kind of the banking division got the credit and then retail mortgage got -- had the expense but it all kind of net out. so some of the modeling economic factors as well as some individual internal credit metrics.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay and then just on the c&i portfolio, it was nice to see some strength there in the core c&i portfolio. i think it was up about 12.5% linked quarter. can you maybe help me understand, is that new kind of commitments? is that increased line utilization? is that some of the folks that you hired over the last year starting to hit their stride? so help me kind of understand what happened there?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a bit of all of the above, which is exciting to see and a lot of it, brody, has come out of some of our investments we've made in many of the growth markets including the charlotte area. north florida had a great quarter as did atlanta, so it has been very consistent and the pipeline has remained full and most of this was incremental new business. and the other part of it is some of this incremental from new markets, which i like seeing. so the investments we made last year are paying off and we are very excited about the outlook there.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. and then just one last one if i may. nicole, do you happen to know what the servicing income was this quarter? i think it was $10.1 million last quarter for the mortgage.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it was pretty consistent with that.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
all, right. thank you very much.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
and you know, that's a good point you bring up there and for everybody on that's listening today, when you look at mortgage and you look at potential volatility in mortgage, one thing that's not as volatile in mortgage is servicing income and we've got a meaningful servicing asset there. i think it's important for people to remember that in terms of, it's certainly helpful for us in terms of our forecasting and budgeting and the income coming from mortgage because it's a nice stabilizer for what can sometimes be a volatile line of business.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you all for taking my questions. i really appreciate it.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great, thanks, brody.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott. please go ahead.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
thanks, good morning. palmer and nicole, you've been able to gain business from other bank mergers for a long, long time. so today's news -- locally is not any surprise. i'm just curious kind of what makes customers move or existing customers do more business with ameris since kind of how that gets applied as that sort of deck chairs gets shuffled once again?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
well, i think it's fairly typical of all disruption. some of it is is when an account officer leaves their bank and moves to another bank, obviously, a lot of people bank with people, but then there is the execution side too and the commitment to the market. i do think that we've benefited from that because we've got a lot of meaningful presence in a lot of key growth markets, but when you start having changes in reporting lines, you start having changes in credit approvals, that can be disruptive to the lenders and it can also be disruptive as an end result to the customer, which is what we're all about. so i think with all the movement out there in terms of m&a and furthermore just changes in reporting lines, that's presented a lot of disruption that we've been able to capitalize on, i think we'll continue to going forward.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
is it fair to say, palmer, that there is more hires coming just from your core lenders on all sides of the bank?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
there are new opportunities and we've got several folks right now and i'm excited to say a lot of them are coming from some of our new initiatives and new markets, especially in the carolinas and florida, but that being said, the thing that gives me comfort in terms of our projections for growth, we have all the folks we need to deliver on the forecast that we have set out for the remainder of this year. so anything beyond that will be incremental lift for us which we'll continue to capitalize on as we move forward.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, great. and last question from me is just about how fintech is evolving for you at ameris? what are the priorities or new initiatives there that we should expect the next couple of quarters?
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think for us, we like to stay, not on the bleeding edge, but on the cutting edge of that. we're obviously heavily involved in a lot of the fintech initiatives that are out there with canopy and fintop and just staying on the forefront of that, but at the same time, it gives us an opportunity to be exposed to that new technology. we've embraced a lot of it. as we've talked about before, robotics continue to be a major focus for us in some of our higher volume areas like mortgage and then we'll continue to roll that out into areas like premium finance and you garner a lot of efficiencies there.
we have an aggressive sales force initiative underway right now throughout the entire company. we were utilizing sales force and into in many of the areas of the company, but going forward, we've got an active rollout of sales force over the next two or three quarters. and i think the important thing, there're so many things that you want to do, but you got to prioritize in terms of where you're going to see the largest gain in efficiencies and so, right now, we see that on the robotics front and on the sales force front and a lot of that has to do with workflow, not just managing pipelines and that's where we will continue to make meaningful investments.
and then obviously, down the road, as we all talk about is what opportunities we might have in terms of our core processors going forward and getting into a more open architecture type of environment, which is really exciting to me and i don't think for the industry, we're quite there yet. we've certainly got some prototypes or experimental activity going on, but until that's a little bit more secure and we've got the comfort of our regulators and everyone else. i think that's probably a couple years out, but in the meantime, there's a lot that banks can be doing now to position themselves to become more efficient and that's what we've prided ourselves on over the last year.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great and that ties all back to the core expense improvements that nicole was elaborating on earlier and there's more there in general.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
absolutely. we've always talked about mortgage and have a scalable business. the question is, is do you execute on that and with the robotics that we had in place that allows quite frankly to make some expense reductions immediately without creating havoc or some sort of concern in the back office environment and so that's where you start really appreciating the efficiency garnered from technology.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great, thanks for the background.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer

good day and welcome to the ameris bank second quarter earnings conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to nicole stokes, please go ahead.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great, thank you, vaish and thank you to all who have joined our call today. during the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the investor relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. i'm joined today by palmer proctor, our ceo and jon edwards, our chief credit officer. palmer will begin with some opening general comments and then i will discuss the details of our financial results before we open it up for q&a.
but before we begin, i'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. the actual results could vary materially. we will list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our sec filings, which are available on our website. we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law.
also during the call, we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures in reference to the company's performance. you can see our reconciliation of these measures and gaap financial measures in the appendix to our presentation. and with that, i'll turn it over to palmer for opening comments.
h. palmer proctor -- chief executive officer
thank you, nicole and thank you to everyone who's joined our call today. i'm excited to share with you our second quarter results. in fact, i was actually more impressed with our team's results this quarter and the record earnings we posted in the first quarter and here's why.
one of the big questions and a very legitimate question for many of our abcb stockholders and stakeholders was what happens when mortgage revenue normalizes for the bank. and this quarter shows you exactly what happens when mortgage revenue moderates. this quarter reflects the purposeful and deliberate actions ameris teammates have taken to reduce expenses associated with the decline in mortgage revenue.
it's also very reflective of the investments we made in top talent in many of our other core lending areas of the company and also reflects the meaningful pipeline and relationships we continue to build, which results in really strong second quarter results as we're reporting net income of $88 million or $1.25 per diluted share on an adjusted basis and this represents a 1.63% return on average assets and a 19.46% return on tangible equity.
our adjusted efficiency ratio actually improved from the first [phonetic] quarter to 54.62% reported in the first quarter to this quarter's 54.07%. as you may recall, we reversed $28.6 million of provision for loan loss expense last quarter. in this quarter, we had just a minimal provision expense due to the positive loan growth we'll talk about.
and speaking to loan growth, it was an incredible quarter that we had and when you look at our annualized net loan growth, it was right at 5% for the quarter, net of ppp and our indirect run-off and we still expect to deliver on mid-to-upper single digit loan growth for the year as we look at our pipelines and the opportunities in all of our growth markets.
the area i was most excited about was the $100 million of growth we had in c&i and you'll be able to see this on our slide deck on page 16 and nicole is going to discuss the excess liquidity and the impact to our margin in more details in a few minutes, but i did want to mention the continued deposit growth for this quarter too.
our growth in non-interest bearing deposits continued to outpace the growth of total deposits and they are now approaching 40% of total deposits, which is very impressive and i emphasize this because when rates start moving back up and some of the excess liquidity runs off, i think that's the time you're going to find out from the real leaders or who the real leaders are in our industry in terms of who took the opportunity to grow core funding during this time and we'll certainly be a standout there.
on the capital side of the balance sheet, our capital position remains strong. we've consistently said we're focused on growing tangible book and that's exactly what we did this quarter. we saw growth in both tce and tangible book value. we grew tangible book value by $1.18 per share or 4.7% during the second quarter. we've also grown tangible book value by $2.76 or over 11% for the year so far and this equates to over 20% annualized growth for tangible book value.
our tce ratio increased to 8.83%, which is very close to our 9% goal and if you exclude the $2.5 billion of excess liquidity on our balance sheet, the tce ratio would have been over 10%. we clearly have the capital to support our growth initiatives and to consider opportunistic transactions as we go forward. jon edwards, our chief credit officer, is with us today and he is available to take any questions after our prepared remarks, but i did want to hit a few highlights in terms of credit.
our non-performing assets as a percent of total assets improved to 32 basis points compared to 40 basis points last quarter and 59 basis points last year. loans that remain on deferral at the end of the quarter were approximately 1.2% of total loans, which is down from approximately 19% of total loans this time last year. our allowance coverage ratio excluding unfunded commitments was 1.23%, net of our ppp loans at the end of the quarter.
in terms of covid, a quick update here, july 6 was our official back to the office date. all of our branches are opened and all of our staff including support and administrative staff are back to the office. some of that in a new hybrid approach, but we're adapting well and our teams are really excited to have a new sense of normalcy. as i mentioned last quarter, most business are back open, traffic jams are back to normal and restaurants and wait times and new restaurants are actually opening. so things are definitely getting back to normal in the southeast and we certainly expect to benefit and capitalize from that.
a quick update on ppp, we continue to see forgiveness in round one during the quarter and we started receiving forgiveness funds on round two in june. we've got approximately $126 million left of the $1.1 billion that we loaned out in round one and we have about $362 million left of the $409 million from round two. there is about $22 million of deferred revenue remaining on ppp for us.
and one last comment i wanted to make. i'm very proud to announce that we published our first corporate social responsibility report in may, which was in accordance with the sustainability accounting standards board and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures and a shout out to our entire team. there is a lot of thought and a lot of actions and hard work that went into this report and i'm really pleased and proud of the way it came out and i hope you all take a minute to look at it, but i'll stop there now and turn it over to nicole to discuss our financial results in more detail.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great, thank you, palmer. as you stated, for the second quarter, we're reporting net income of $88.3 million or $1.27 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, we earned $87.5 million or $1.25 per diluted share and that's really excluding the small recovery on the servicing asset impairment and a gain on sale of premises this quarter.
we're pleased with our operating ratios. our adjusted roa in the second quarter was 1.63% and for the year it's 1.94%. our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 19.46% for the quarter and 23.41% for the year-to-date. as palmer mentioned, our tangible book value increased by $1.18 or 4.7% from $25.27 to $26.45 during the quarter. for the year-over-year, tangible book value has increased $5.55 or 26.6% from $20.90 this time last year. in addition, our tangible common equity ratio increased 21 basis points this quarter to 8.83% from 8.62% at the end of the first quarter and it's increased 113 basis points over the past year from 7.70% this time last year.
the approximate $2.5 billion of excess liquidity on our balance sheet negatively impacted this ratio by 120 basis points. so excluding that cash from total assets, our tce ratio would have been approximately 10.03% at quarter-end, which is well above our stated target of 9%. so we continue to be well capitalized and we feel comfortable with our capital and our dividend level.
talking a little bit on margin, our net interest margin declined 23 basis points from 3.57% to 3.34% during the quarter. our yield on earning assets declined by 27 basis points while our total funding cost decreased 4 basis points. we did a description of this on slide 8, you can see the 27 basis point decline was attributable to several unusual factors.
we had 8 basis points of compression from the $4 million decline in ppp income. we had 5 basis points from the almost $2 million or $1.7 million of accretion income decline. we had 5 basis points kind of a bump last quarter that was a non-recurring revenue related to the sale of our consumer portfolio. we had 4 basis points due to the continued growth in excess liquidity and then we really came down to 5 final basis points due to true loan yield compression. that was 2 basis points in mortgage, 1 basis point in held for sale, and 2 basis points of true commercial bank loan yield compression.
so my point here is that true loan yield compression was really 5 basis points and we had the 4 basis points of funding costs during the quarter. also added to slide 8, you can see the impact that, that $2.5 billion of excess liquidity had on our margin and how it accounts for 36 basis points of the total negative margin compression from one year ago. we're focused on our deposit costs and we continue to grind them down. we still have some room for improvement in the cd portfolio, but the real driver to an improving margin going forward is putting that excess liquidity to work, which we anticipate occurring over the next three quarters.
as palmer mentioned as well, we had a small provision for loan loss expense of about $142,000 compared to that $28.6 million reversal last quarter. the continued economic conditions specifically unemployment, gdp, and cre index and our own improved credit quality this quarter helped offset the need for additional provisions on our loan growth.
our ending allowance for loan loss of $175.1 million compared to just $178.6 million at the end of last quarter and $208.8 million at the end of second quarter last year, which was in the middle of the pandemic and our heightened deferral. so including the unfunded commitment reserve and allowance for credit losses for other credit losses, our total allowance was $197.8 million at quarter-end compared with $200.2 million at the end of last quarter.
moving on to non-interest income. so, as expected, our non-interest income declined this quarter and it really was due to the decreases in mortgage banking. excluding the $9.7 million recovery last quarter and the $749,000 recovery this quarter, our mortgage income declined about $19.3 million and there's really two factors contributing to the decline in revenue. it was both production and gain on sale margins.
as you can see, we put in a new slide 11, which really has some information on mortgage, but as you can see on that slide, production in the retail mortgage group declined 9% to $2.4 billion this quarter from $2.6 billion last quarter and it's important to note here that total non-interest expense also declined 9% or $5.6 million in the retail mortgage division.
in addition to that production that's going to drive those reductions in variable costs, we also saw the average gain on sale decrease back to normal levels. it decreased to 2.77% compared to elevated 3.95% last quarter. we really don't anticipate further decline in the gain on sale margins. the open pipeline at the end of the second quarter was $1.7 billion compared to $2.3 billion at the end of last quarter and we do believe that there is further reductions in non-interest expense if production continues to decline.
as we previously stated, we stated we had a large amount of our expenses are variable costs and we designed that in our mortgage group. total non-interest expense for the company declined by $13 million from $148.8 million last quarter to $135.8 million this quarter. as i just mentioned, mortgage expenses declined almost $6 million during the quarter and an additional $6.5 million reduction was seen in the banking division, which includes the enterprisewide service and support staff. we continue to look for ways to become more efficient and we continuously monitor the efficiency ratio by division.
on that note, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved slightly this quarter to 54.07% from 54.62% last quarter. i previously guided for the efficiency ratio to stabilize in the 53% to 55% range because we did not anticipate that previous level of mortgage revenue and efficiency to be sustainable. so i think a 54.07% is right in the middle of that range as we saw mortgage stabilize. and then also reminder this quarter we saw the gain on sale margin which doesn't affect the variable cost fell back to normal levels and we still saw that improvement in our efficiency ratio.
on the balance sheet side, we ended the quarter with assets of $21.9 billion compared to $21.4 billion at the end of last quarter. we were pleased with our organic loan growth of $181 million or 5% annualized for the second quarter. as you can see on slide 16, we had about -- we had $473 million of headwind against the $655 million growth in cre, c&i, premium finance, and residential. ppp loans declined $304 million and indirect loans declined $85 million. we have approximately $488 million of ppp loans left and we have $397 million of indirect loans left with us. we anticipate the headwinds from run-off in both of these portfolios to really subside early next year.
and a few extra details on ppp. we've received payments and forgiveness of approximately $975 million on round one leaving the outstanding balance at $126 million and we now have the new round two balance at $362 million. the average balance of ppp loans in the second quarter was $708.5 million compared to an average balance in the first quarter of $764.9 million. we have about $22.3 million left of deferred income on the ppp loans. that's $2.2 million on round one and $20.1 million on round two and again, we anticipate amortizing that into income over the next year, if not sooner.
we already discussed the excess liquidity you can see in other earning assets on the balance sheet due to our tremendous deposit growth that we've seen over the past few quarters, but again this quarter, we grew $382 million this quarter in deposits and 46% of that growth was in non-interest bearing. i sound like a broken record, but we really do anticipate some deposit run-off as lives get back to normal post pandemic and as rates potentially rise. we continue to anticipate net loan growth, net of ppp activity for the year in the mid-single digits, which is about $1 billion of loan growth. that leaves about $1.5 billion of excess cash to prepare for deposit run-off if rates start to increase and to begin buying investments in the bond portfolio.
we did purchase a $100 million of boli during the second quarter with a non-taxable yield of approximately 3.5% and we are considering other investment purchases although we would like the curve to steepen just a little bit before we really start doing that. and with that, i will wrap it up. i appreciate everyone's time today and i will turn the call over to vaish for any questions from the group.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from brady gailey from kbw. brady, please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay, thanks. good morning, guys. i just wanted to start with mortgage fees. if you back out the noise related to the msr, mortgage fees were down about 17% linked quarter, which is a little more than i thought they would be. so maybe just any kind of comment on that decline? did it surprise you guys? and how are you thinking about mortgage as we head into 2022? i know it's a tough thing to predict.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, freddy -- brady. the -- sorry about that. we're learning a new system on our end with the conference call, so i picked up the wrong name. sorry, brady. so on the mortgage revenue side, a lot of that has to do with timing and the large production that we had in the second quarter and the acceleration of some sales in the second quarter. so that did drive down a little bit. it's not necessarily the third quarter, it affected the third quarter because the second quarter was so elevated with that timing issue. so we do -- as i said, the production was down about 14% and revenue was down 17%, but some of that again was the timing issue. so we anticipate like that pair-off fee that we discussed in the press release to go back up a little bit next quarter, and it should rebound.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
and more importantly, too, brady, i think everybody saw the improvement in the margin there. that bounced back to over three percent. we were down at 2.75%, i think, last quarter. so between the production and the margin, we feel very positive about fourth quarter in terms of mortgage, a lot of mortgages, as you all know, is about timing, and we had the opportunity to have some meaningful sales at the end of second quarter that obviously impacted third quarter.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and then nicole, i noticed that other expenses were up about $7 million linked quarter. was there anything notable in other expenses this quarter?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
we did. we had some one time, what we call, our one time expenses. we settled an old legal suit, so we had some additional professional fees related to that and then the settlement. and so we don't expect those to recur. and then we also had, like we talked about the -- some lease expense that we're getting out of. and then also the state tax, if you notice, our tax rate increased slightly this quarter. that's due to a state tax liability. that was just a one time thing and that we expect that to go back as well.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. all right. and then the last one for me. i know we've talked about an efficiency ratio of 53% to 55% for you guys. is that still the way you're thinking about it as we head into 2022?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
it is. we are still targeting below 55%.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. great. thanks, guys.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from casey whitman of piper sandler. casey, your line is open. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning, just wondering, maybe if you can give us sort of how we should think about if we look at just the core net interest income without ppp and without accretion, sort of given your growth outlook, loan growth outlook for next year, sort of what's a reasonable outlook for what we could see growth in that core and net interest income next year? is it kind of mid-single digits? or is that too low?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, casey. i think a lot of that -- i'm going to talk real quick. just kind of if rates are flat, that's one of the things that our bankers have done a tremendous job is -- and when you see this quarter and you see excluding that ppp and accretion, that we've actually been able to grow our nii. so we do have a little bit more room on the deposit side. this quarter, we saw about two basis points of nim defense coming from the deposit side. we still have a little bit more room there on mostly the cd side. so that should help stabilize some of the compression that we might see from the loan side. when you think about the yield curve steepening or and the fed tightening, and we start to see maybe some upward movement there. we are asset-sensitive, and we've positioned ourselves that way.
so again, about 100 basis point move is about $44 million of nii increase for us. so you can say that we really start to see that at about the 50-basis point bump when we start to get in between 25 and 50 basis points of improvement in the yield curve with the fed move is when we'll start really seeing some increased movement on our nii as well.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. understood. and just to tighten up to the loan growth guide, i heard a mid- to upper and then a seven percent to nine percent range. is that -- is the mid- to upper kind of how you're thinking about for this year and then potentially getting closer to that seven percent to nine percent range for next year? just to be clear.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. that's exactly right. this year is kind of in that five percent to seven percent range and then next year is coming in that seven percent to nine percent. and a lot of that is because of the headwind of the indirect and the ppp coming out next year.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
i'll let them know. thanks.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thank you, casey.

our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from d.a. davidson. kevin, please go ahead.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
good morning everyone. i was wondering if you could -- and apologies if i missed it. if you -- you talked quite a bit about the margin and the drivers for it. anything you can -- however you want to characterize it, reported margin, core margin in terms of how you're looking out into fourth quarter and then into next year? and then, nicole, i guess i would -- a very important part of that, obviously, is the excess liquidity and what you do with it. so maybe kind of a tangential question is, do you plan to get a little more aggressive on deploying it into securities? or are you more content with if you see this loan growth coming, waiting for that to come? thanks.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so as far as margin, we did have the 12 basis points of compression this quarter. but when you look at it, you really have the eight basis points comes from liquidity, and so then the remaining four basis points. six basis points was on the loan side, but it really was all the ppp accretion income. it came down and then just our normal accretion income that came down offset by the two basis points. so when you look at kind of a core margin run rate, we were successful in keeping that flat for the quarter, which i think is a huge win. i don't know that we're going to be able to do that again next quarter. i think we have another one to two basis points potentially on the deposit side that could offset a few basis points on the loan side. so like i said, we really need rates to go up 25 to 50 basis points. our coming on rates are lower than our margins.
so there is a little bit of a drain right now, but we're doing everything we can on the deposit side to defend that. as far as the excess liquidity, we've got about $3 billion of excess liquidity. we've come to earmark $1 billion to $1.5 billion for loan growth next year. that gives us about $1.5 billion to be ready to start deploying it into the bond portfolio as well as to be prepared for deposit runoff. and then if there was any other opportunities out there that we see in the second quarter, we did buy about $100 million of borrowing. while it doesn't go into the margin, it does go into noninterest income. so any type of those type of transactions, it could be opportunistic for us to use some of that liquidity. we really are continuing to hold off on the bond portfolio.
we did start to buy some cre investments in our in held-to-maturity bucket, but really being cautious on the held investments. just -- we don't want to do something today that in six months from now when rates are different, we have a big impact to oci. so we're trying to be diligent and disciplined there. and just remember that if we can continue to grow that nii through the loan growth and through watching our deposit costs that we know that we can control the excess liquidity and the margin ratio and just really focus on the nii number and the growth there.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. that makes perfect sense. one additional question. i just wanted to get your -- palmer, your updated thoughts on m&a. and maybe if you can differentiate by bank or nonbank. we've seen a lot of banks get more interested in bolting on asset generators, given the excess liquidity. and if m&a is still as important, if maybe in this environment, you can go out and do team lift outs and do strategic hires? just wondering what your latest thoughts on that are. thanks. thanks, palmer.

you bet. and i would kind of answer that in one wording. it's really optionality, and that's one of the benefits of our company here is that we've positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities. but that being said, as you know, we're pretty disciplined here, and things have got to make sense to do it. we're very sensitive to dilution. but to answer your question more specifically, we'd look at both banking and nonbank. and if we're able to further a particular line of business or do lift out somewhere, we will certainly entertain that as well. because i think we can all see as we go forward, the importance of not having a dependency on just the margin, fee income piece is critical, which is -- speaks well to our profile when you look at the lines of business that we're in, whether it's the premium finance or the sba or the mortgage. so i think we could do things to further those existing lines in addition to potentially finding other opportunities for fee income on both the bank and nonbank side.
kevin fitzsimmons -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question is from david feaster from raymond james. david, please go ahead.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. i just wanted to start on production. overall, production, you guys have done a really good job and held steady just north of about $900 million in the past couple of quarters. i guess, how do you think about the ability to accelerate production going forward? is there a -- we've talked in the past about the increased appetite to maybe move upstream? does that potentially help? or is it new hires that you talked about? just curious your thoughts on that production side.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yes. i would answer it this way, david. we are very fortunate with the investments that i touched on earlier that we've made over the last 18 months, and there's very little dependency on betting on the comp for the future because we've got the right resources in place, and we're very fortunate to be in some high-growth markets. so when you look at incremental growth for the remainder of this year and into next year, and the pipelines are as full as they've ever been. so i feel very encouraged across the board in all lines of business. and more particularly, in a lot of the new markets we're in, and that's both from a deposit and a loan production standpoint. so i think for us, unlike many others, we pretty much know exactly where that production is coming from and the investments we made a while back are already hitting the stride because, as you know, when you make investments in new talent, there's a ramp-up period.
and that period for us, we've already got a run rate, not a ramp-up period. and i think that will be a big distinction, especially when you look at some of the heavy growth markets that we're in. so right now, as nicole touched on in terms of our anticipation for growth, a lot of it is obviously driven by what happens with the economy and the political headwinds. but i feel very confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that has a lot to do with the talent and it has a lot to do with the growth markets that we operate in.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe just touching a bit on the competitive landscape. we hear a lot of competition on the pricing side. obviously, new loan yields have come down. but just curious your thoughts on the competitive landscape from both a pricing and a structure standpoint. do you think that's intensified at all? and then do you -- i guess, on the pricing front, do you think -- it seems like there's more pressure on the variable side. just curious whether the steepening of the curve is helping new pricing at all that we might be troughing?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yes. i think pricing is going to continue to be a challenge. in terms of structure, i will tell you, i don't see anybody in our peer group that's reaching on asset quality in terms of compromising asset quality, which is a good thing because, as we all know, can lead to major problems down the road. so from what i've seen out there, i don't see anybody reaching on or basically compromising on asset quality. what you do see along the lines of structure, there are some extended interest-only periods that are being offered. the nonrecourse, you're seeing a lot more nonrecourse, but at the same time, you're seeing much more equity going into deals and stronger sponsors behind those deals. so i think there's some mitigants there. the way we look at pricing is we're going to be very competitive if there's a relationship involved. if there's not, and it's simply a transaction, that's very different.
the other thing, i think, is a big distinction for us, just due to our ability to grow organically. when a lot of people are growing these portfolios, they have a dependency to depend on third-party indirect relationships and participations. that is not something we have a dependency on, and i'm glad for that, that i think can -- a bridge strategy there can become a permanent strategy, and we don't want to get ourselves into that situation. so that being said, then you're going to have to fight for the business. and pricing, as we look forward, we'll continue to be very competitive on both the c&i side and the cre side. but the only compromise i'm seeing right now is on structure in terms of really interest rate risk that you may be taking and then interest-only periods in nonrecourse.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just kind of following up on the m&a commentary. i mean there's a lot of discussions out there. everybody's playing matchmaker. just appreciate that you guys are coming at this from an opportunistic standpoint and don't need to do something. i guess, what's your appetite for maybe more of a transformative type acquisition versus some more of those bolt-on type deals? just curious how you think about those.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
well, to your point, we've been extremely disciplined in our approach. and we are not against a larger type transaction, but having just been through an noe here, i can tell you they're very difficult to implement over time. and so you have to be prepared for those challenges. so for us to get into something that would be along those lines, it would have to check a lot of boxes. and when you start looking at -- and we're very sensitive dilution, as you know. and so when you go down that path, oftentimes, it's going to be hard to find a partner in that regard. but that being said, we're not against larger transactions, but they would certainly have to be in keeping with our disciplines here.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then nicole, if i could just squeeze one more in. could you -- appreciate the commentary on the onetime expenses. could you quantify those? maybe just give us any thoughts on a good core expense run rate going forward?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so the tax piece was about $4 million. and then the kind of the onetime other expenses were about another $3.5 million to $4 million.
david feaster -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott. christopher, your line is open.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
thanks. good morning, palmer, nicole, can you talk about new hires in both -- on all of the commercial, wealth and mortgage channels? just curious kind of new staffing changes in the future?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, chris, for the questions. as i've mentioned before, we are fortunate in the sense that to hit our current projections for growth, we've got everybody we need. so anything -- anybody that we add now in a way of talent is incremental growth and talent. and third quarter, in terms of the commercial front, we hired about five folks there. it was kind of evenly dispersed across the board in terms of commercial bankers. from greenville to atlanta, jacksonville and tampa. we have made some recent hires in the wealth department as well that i think will be meaningful and that area continues to grow and the great fee income opportunity for the bank, especially as we expand into other markets. mortgage, we're constantly hiring there. and so that's always active.
but right now, the majority of the banker hires that we're seeing or the talent we're seeing, which is coming primarily from most of the larger regional banks is in the -- on the commercial front. and some of those are in our newer markets, the charlottes, the tampas. we're seeing some good opportunities there in addition to add some supplemental talent in the greenville, atlanta and jacksonville markets.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. great. and then just a follow-up on the mortgage business. i know that the gain on sale was better this quarter, as you disclosed. i know it's a multi-quarter evolution on kind of some of the efficiencies in mortgage, but what's the progress there? and kind of how will that play out this next year?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so we continue to look at the efficiency ratio in the mortgage group. and i think you can see on the mortgage side that we added, that our expenses continue to go down with the revenues. and so we had this quarter, we did have -- because of those pair-off fees that are -- they are still about 80% variable of our expenses. and so any kind of change in the production is what will drive that efficiency. and then we continue to look for other areas within mortgage to find some efficiencies.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
chris, as we talked on last quarter too, technology is a big opportunity here and a big driver for all mortgage companies and ours included. and we feel like we've got a good hit start on that, which really helped us propel us through the opportunities during pandemic. but that being said, as we go forward, we continue to find more and more opportunities for efficiency just in terms of how we produce. and then also looking at capturing more of the online type mortgage opportunities that exist as opposed to just through the retail network.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great. and just to expand on nicole's point. so if you have a quarter or a year where production is not expanding, there's still opportunities to get the margin slightly better, just with purely those efficiencies?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
when you say the margins, so the gain on sale margin is not necessarily, but there is an opportunity for efficiency based on the production.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. so think of it as two to two. two separate?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. and so really, when you think about mortgage revenue, you've got two drivers, you've got production and gain on sale. and so a lot of the expense structure is based on the production and not necessarily on the gain on sale. so if the gain on sale goes up, where -- obviously, the efficiency ratio will get better. but if the gain on sale goes down, there's not necessarily that driver on the expense side to stabilize it. but as production goes up or down, you have the expenses moving in line with that. so it's certainly driven by the production side as far as the downward improvement of an efficiency ratio.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
got it, thanks for clarifying that. i appreciate it.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure.
operator
our next question is from brody preston from stephens inc. brody, please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning, everyone. nicole, there was a line in the press release as it relates to mortgage that kind of caught my eye. you noted that there was an $18.5 million reduction in mortgage pair-off compared to the second quarter. and i know that those fees are typically kind of charged to the sellers of mortgage loans if they don't fulfill their agreements. and so are you all a buyer of mortgage loans before for securitization purposes? like what is the -- what are those pair-off fees for you all?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. and so no, we are not a buyer of those. and what that really had to do it is last quarter because of -- it's a timing issue and because of last quarter, the overall production, and we accelerated the selling of some loans in the second quarter that we received some pair-offs in excess. we were able to over fulfill some. and so we've got the benefits of that last quarter, which is really that drives of that coming down this quarter. so it's not necessarily that we were penalized this quarter. it's just that we had some excess or some additional last quarter.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. got it. and was any of that in the gain on sale margin last quarter? or is that excluded from that?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's excluded from that.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. understood. thanks for that. maybe just on the margin front, maybe trying this a different way. so when i look at the hfi loan income and i stripped out the impacts of purchase accounting and ppp. year-over-year, you all are down about 2.5% to about $145 million this quarter versus about $149 million in the 3q20 quarter. and i know that the new production yields are relatively challenging, but you all have grown core loans five percent over that period. so i guess, help me think about the trajectory, i guess, maybe of loan income going forward, especially as new production yields seem to be coming on a bit lower. and when i look at the back book, at least for stand-alone ameris, i know some of that changed post-lion. but in 2018 and 2019, the banking division was putting on loans in the high fours to mid-fives kind of range. so it just seems like a challenging ramp for loan income despite a strong growth outlook from here. so how do we think about that?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think you're exactly right. and like i said, our projections don't -- if you just take out any fed rate or steepening there of the curve, that it's definitely an uphill battle. but our bankers have done a tremendous job, especially, i mean, this quarter is a great example of that. so while we continue to see the coming on rate below our current margin, and we continue to see that squeeze coming in on the loan side, we do have the growth to offset some of that. so you make up some of that lost revenue you make up on volume versus the rate. and so we continue to do that. and it's interesting when you look at kind of our coming on rates, our fixed rate production has been fairly stable over the last few quarters. it's that variable rate production that's lower. and so that will help us and help us on the asset sensitivity side so that when rates do start to move, that piece of the portfolio will move as well and will help us in that environment.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you for that, and then on the cecl side, you all noted that there was a $7.5 million decrease on specific reserves. and there were net recoveries in the quarter and gross charge-offs were only $3.5 million. so i wanted to ask, what was it that drove that? i think there was a reduction in the hotel exposure this quarter. was it related to that? just wanted to get a sense for what happened there.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
that's exactly what happened there. as we push further behind or ahead of the covid impact, hotels, certain hotel loans were showing improvement through the quarter, and they were removed off of the 14 list.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and i think there was $49.3 million of the hotel exposure that was still on the watch list. is that something where i think you guys did a pretty good job exiting some of the weaker relationships last year. is that something where you continue to work with those borrowers? or is it -- are those loans that you've kind of earmarked for natural kind of run off as they mature going forward?
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
well, really, what that is more a reflection of is some hotels were faster to heal than others. and so we're kind of -- until we get pretty good clarity of the financial performance post covid, they're better and sustainable, we've left them on the watch list. so what really that is, is just sort of the remnants of hotel loans that have yet to really reach breakeven or better operating results, but not necessarily saying that we'll look to push those out of the bank, but they're just continuing to take a little extra time to get over the hump.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and then i just had one more. nicole, if i could just circle back to those pair-off fees. i just had a question from someone. should i -- should we expect those to be in the yearly run rate, like some of those pair-off fees tied to the excess production on a fairly lumpy basis quarter-to-quarter? or is that something that is more idiosyncratic to that quarter, and it shouldn't be modeled going forward?
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
the latter, you're exactly right. and it really had to do with that push in the second quarter to accelerate some sales in the second quarter. and so it's typically not as lumpy.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for taking my questions. and i appreciate it.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, brody..

good morning, or good afternoon, all, and welcome to the ameris bank third quarter earnings conference call. my name is adam, and i'll be your operator today. [operator instructions]
i will now hand you over to nicole stokes, chief financial officer, to begin. so nicole, please go ahead when you are ready.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thank you, adam, and thank you to all who have joined our call today. during the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the investor relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. i'm joined today by palmer proctor, our ceo; and jon edwards, our chief credit officer. palmer will begin with some opening general comments, and then i will discuss the details of our financial results before we open up for q&a. but before we begin, i'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. the actual results could vary materially. we list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our sec filings, which are available on our website. we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law. also during the call, we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures in reference to the company's performance. you can see our reconciliation of these measures and our gaap financial measures in the appendix to our presentation.
and with that, i'll turn it over to palmer for opening comments.
h. palmer proctor jr. -- chief executive officer
thank you, nicole, and good morning, everyone. i want to thank you all for taking time to join us this morning for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. we were very pleased with the third quarter and the momentum that we have with the loan production, the growth and the financial results. nicole is going to update you on some of the detailed results in a few minutes, but i did want to hit a few highlights for the quarter as well as a few other successes, which positively impact our outlook as we go forward. for the quarter, we earned $83.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, and this represented a 1.51% return on average assets and a 17.65% return on tangible equity. for the year-to-date period, we earned $287.2 million or $4.12 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, which is a significant increase from the $2.86 reported in the same period last year.
the 2021 results represent a year-to-date roa of 1.79% and the year-to-date return on average tangible equity of 21.38%. our adjusted efficiency ratio this quarter was 56.56%, an increase from the 54.07% last quarter due to certain nonrecurring expenses during the quarter. and that said, our year-to-date efficiency ratio is 55.05% and should return below 55% by the end of the year. we remain very encouraged by our organic growth, both on the loan and deposit side. and exclusive of ppp runoff, loans grew over $250 million or seven percent annualized during the quarter, and that leaves our year-to-date annualized loan growth of 8.7% excluding ppp runoff and 3.2% including ppp runoff. we still expect to see mid- to upper single-digit loan growth for the year based on our pipelines and opportunities within our growth markets.
on the deposit side, we continue to see a lot of success there in growing noninterest-bearing deposits, which now account for over 40% of our total deposits. nicole is going to discuss our excess liquidity and the impact, obviously, it has on the margin in more detail in a few minutes. i did want to mention the continued success we have there on the deposit front. on the capital side of the balance sheet, our capital position remains strong. we've consistently said that we're very focused on tangible book value growth. and this quarter was no different. i'm happy to report we grew tangible book value by over $1 per share or 3.8% during the third quarter alone, and we've grown tangible book value by $3.77 or almost 16% for the year so far, and this equates to over 20% annualized growth rate in tangible book value, which is very meaningful.
our tce ratio increased to 8.8%, very close to our nine percent goal. and if you exclude the $3 billion of excess liquidity on our balance sheet, the tce ratio would have been well over 10%. so clearly, we have ample capital to support our growth initiatives and consider opportunistic transactions. while we remain focused on capital preservation, we did announce, as many of you may have seen in our release that our board approved extending our share repurchase program through october 31 next year. we did repurchase $6.5 million during the third quarter, and that leaves approximately $79 million left on that program. and while we don't anticipate executing on this during the remainder of 2021, we do like having the optionality if the right opportunity presents itself. as for our dividend, we still remain very comfortable with where our dividends are today.
jon edwards, our chief credit officer, is with us today, and he's certainly available to take any credit questions after our prepared remarks, but i wanted to hit a few highlights in terms of credit. for the quarter, we had net recoveries of $127,000, so 0 charge-off ratio compared to $2.6 million of net charge-offs last quarter, seven basis points. our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was consistent with last quarter of 32 basis points. loans that remain on deferral at the end of the quarter were approximately 0.6% of total loans, which are down from approximately 4.3% of total loans at the same time last year. our allowance coverage ratio, excluding unfunded commitments, was 1.18%, net of our ppp loans at the end of the quarter.
and i'll tell you, despite the uncertainty that's still in the economy out there, we continue to see very strong asset quality and solid growth opportunities in our markets for the remainder of this year. and the investments that we made last year and over the last 18 months in both technology and talent continue to propel our incremental growth and really helps us to further leverage our platform. and that certainly has helped us eliminate any dependency on recent hires or future hires to deliver our growth targets. and that's a meaningful distinction for our company.
and i'll stop there and now turn it over to nicole to discuss our financial results in more detail.
nicole s. stokes -- corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer
great. thank you, palmer. so for the third quarter, we're reporting net income of $81.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, we earned $83.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share when you exclude the servicing asset impairment, the loss on bank premises and the merger charges. for the year-to-date period, we are reporting net income of $295 million or $4.23 per diluted share. on an adjusted basis, we earned $287.2 million or $4.12 per diluted share when you exclude those same items i just mentioned. we were pleased with our operating ratios. our adjusted return on assets in the third quarter was 1.51%. and our year-to-date adjusted roa was 1.79%. our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 17.65% for the quarter and 21.38% for the year-to-date period. as palmer mentioned, tangible book value increased by $1.01 or 3.8%.
that was from $26.45 at the end of the second quarter to $27.46 at the end of this quarter. for the year-over-year comparing september 30 last year to september 30 this year, our tangible book value had increased $5 per share or over 22% from $22.46 this time last year. in addition, our tangible common equity ratio increased five basis points to 8.88%, and increased 61 basis points over the past year from 8.27% this time last year. we have approximately $3 billion of excess liquidity on our balance sheet, and that negatively impacted this ratio by 144 basis points. so if you took that cash out of our assets, our tce ratio would have been about 10.32% at quarter-end, which was well above our stated target of 9%. we continue to be well capitalized, and we feel comfortable with our capital and dividend ratios.
moving on to kind of net interest income and the margin. as you can see on slide eight, our net interest income has remained fairly stable since last year. but the thing that we're really proud of, if you look at our net interest income, exclusive of accretion and ppp kind of getting to that core nii, it increased $3.4 million this quarter over last quarter and $1.7 million this quarter over the last -- this time last year. and that shows a real positive trend as people have wondered what happens when ppp runs off. our net interest margin declined by 12 basis points this quarter from 3.34% to 3.22%. our yield on earning assets declined 14 basis points, but our funding costs helped offset that by two basis points. when we look at the margin, we really have four factors. so eight basis points of our margin squeeze came from our excess liquidity that continued to add this quarter; three basis points came from compression from the -- or three basis points of the compression came from the $2 million decline in ppp income; and then there was another about three basis points of decline related to the accretion income decline.
and so that's about the 14 basis points of asset compression offset by two basis points of improvement in our funding costs. so the point there is, excluding the excess liquidity, our margin would have only declined about three to four basis points for the quarter. and all of that is attributable to the ppp and accretion decline. also on slide eight, you can see the table to the left, the $3 billion of excess liquidity and what it's done to our margin ratio. it accounts for about 42 basis points total of the negative compression from one year ago. so we remain focused on our deposit costs, and we continue to grind them down. we still have some room for improvement in the cd portfolio, but the real driver to an improving margin is putting that excess liquidity to work. we continue to anticipate net loan growth net of ptp activity next year in the high single digits, kind of that seven percent to nine percent range, which is about $1 billion to $1.3 billion of loan growth.
that leaves about $1.8 billion of excess cash to prepare for our deposit runoff. and then all set to begin buying investments and to fund opportunistic if other investments become available. moving on to provision. we reversed about $9.7 million of provision expense for the quarter, and that really was due to an improvement in the economy, specifically home prices and the cre index and then our own improved credit quality this quarter with that -- as palmer mentioned, the recovery versus charge-offs helped offset the need for additional provisions on our loan growth. our ending allowance for loan losses was $171.2 million compared to the $175.1 million at the end of last quarter. and including the unfunded commitment reserve and allowance for other credit losses, our total allowance for credit losses was $188.2 million at quarter-end.
noninterest income declined $12.7 million this quarter due to decreases in mortgage banking activity. as shown on slide 11, the retail mortgage originations now represent 17% of our pre-provision pre-tax income for the third quarter, and that was down from 49% this time last year. production in the retail mortgage group declined about 14% to $2.1 billion for the quarter. and similar to last quarter, our noninterest expenses declined about eight percent or $4.4 million in the retail mortgage division. the average gain on sale increased to 3.17% for the quarter compared to 2.77% last quarter. and the open pipeline -- this is encouraging, the open pipeline at the end of the third quarter was $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion at the end of the second quarter.
total noninterest expenses increased by $1.4 million from the $135.8 million last quarter to the $137 million this quarter. but excluding the loss on bank premises and the merger charges, noninterest expense actually declined $120,000. as i mentioned, mortgage revenue -- net mortgage expenses declined about $4.4 million during the quarter, but those savings were offset by increases in other areas, including enterprisewide services and support staff. a lot of those increases and the majority of those increases were related to increased legal and professional fees and other onetime expenses that are not expected to be recurring. because of these nonrecurring expenses, our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.56% versus 54.07% last quarter, but we do expect that it will return to under 55% by the end of the year.
on the balance sheet side, we ended the quarter with assets of $22.5 billion compared to $21.9 billion at the end of last quarter. we really were pleased with our organic loan growth of $43.7 million, which is above one percent for the third quarter. but as you can see on slide 16, we had $471 million of headwind against $515 million growth in cre, c&i, premium finance and residential. ppp loans declined $208 million and indirect loans declined $72 million. so excluding that ppp runoff, our loan growth was about seven percent annualized. we have about $280 million of ppp loans left, and we have about $325 million of indirect loans left. so we really anticipate the headwind from the runoff in both of these portfolios to subside early next year. while i'm on ppp, just a quick update there. we've received payments and forgiveness of just over $1 billion on round one, leaving the outstanding balance there at just $21 million.
and then the round two, we have a balance of about $259 million. the average balance of ppp loans in the third quarter was $377 million compared to an average balance in the second quarter of $708 million. we have about $14.7 million left of deferred fee income on the ppp loan, which, again, we anticipate amortizing into income over the next three quarters. so we already discussed the excess liquidity that you can see in our other earning assets on the balance sheet due to the tremendous deposit growth we saw this quarter. deposits grew $575 million. but the real key here is that noninterest-bearing deposits grew $633 million, and our interest-bearing decreased about $58 million. as palmer mentioned, our noninterest-bearing are now over 40% of our total deposits. this is just really key as our bankers have continued to grow noninterest-bearing deposits to fund that future growth. and i said last quarter, we do anticipate some deposit runoff as life starts to get back to normal post-pandemic and as rates potentially rise.
so with that, i will wrap it up. i appreciate everyone's time today. i want to turn the call back over to adam for any questions from the group.
