thank you for holding. welcome to csn's earnings conference call to present the results for the third quarter '19. today, we have with us the company's executive officers.
[operator instructions]
we've have simultaneous webcast that may be accessed through csn's investor relations, website at www.csn.com.br/ir, where the presentation is also available. the replay of this service will be available for a period of one week. once again, please feel free to flip through the slides at your convenience.
before proceeding, we'd like to state that some of the forward-looking statements here are near expectations and trends based on current assumptions and opinions of the company's management. future results, performance and events may differ materially from those expressed herein, which do not constitute projections. actual results, performances or events may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, as a result of several factors, such as general and economic conditions in brazil and other countries, interest rates and exchange rate levels, future rescheduling or prepayment of foreign currencies pegged protectionist measures in the us, brazil and other countries, changes in laws and regulations, and general competitive factors at global, regional or national basis.
we'll now turn the floor over to mr. marcelo cunha ribeiro, the investor relations executive officer, who will present the company's operating and financial highlights for the period. you have the floor, mr. ribeiro. you may proceed.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- chief financial and investor relations officer
first of all, a good morning to all of you. and thank you very much for your presence, especially those who are here with us. during this quarter, we have changed our format, making it more interactive. we do apologize due to the logistic complexity, which you may face but it is for a good reason. most of the market participants are here face-to-face, and we also thank those participating through the conference call.
we'll -- as usual, make an initial presentation, which we hope to keep very brief, signaling the highlights for the period. our cfo and chairman of the board will join us, make his comments on the period on the company's strategies and ensuing this, we'll open the floor for your questions. and of course, we'll answer all the necessary questions and we thank all of you for your patience.
we may begin with the presentation. therefore -- for those who are accompanying us through the webcast, we begin with the highlights of this period on page number two, where we present to you the different fronts where we've focused our efforts that is to say, operational results and acceleration of deleveraging and financial liabilities.
now this was a transitional quarter. we've brl1.6 billion, although we have gone through the most acute phase of a very important event at the company, which was the blast furnace number three maintenance, with an impact not only on steel, but mining because of unsold products and cement because of the higher costs. now despite having had the mining prices impacted by these one-time factors and increase in freight and others, despite all of this, we did have a strong ebitda of brl1.6 million [phonetic], but we were affected by the foreign exchange variation. our debt had an increase and also by very timely events.
now what has happened to our results, increasing our debt is now returning. once again, this has been a quarter of transition. we acknowledge this, but we've achieved good results. another highlight besides the lengthening of the debt is this new bond that we have issued with the support of capital markets.
to support the quality of our debt, as we'll see in the presentation, we have several other initiatives under way. and in the third place, we are also with several initiatives under way to reduce the size of our debt. this quarter, what we delivered was one more pre-payment from glencore, but we have also focused on other initiatives; the sale of assets, as well as, other more structured financial initiatives to reduce the dimension of our debt. once again, these are the highlights of the quarter.
we now go on to the main financial and operational indicators on page number four, with greater detail in terms of our ebitda, which is the most significant or visible financial indicator. in perspective, you will see the sequence of our results, this quarter vis-a-vis the second quarter. well, we may call it a certain disappointment -- because the second quarter was the best in the year. all of the stars lined-up in mining, we also had very good results in the steel industry.
we had an exceptionally low freight, very high-volumes, which means that everything contributed to this. it was a true flyer. now during this quarter, as you can see, some factors were against us, hampering our performance. but despite this, we delivered this brl1.6 million, with a 25% margin, very similar to what we have delivered in the past and that enable us to foresee for the year an ebitda of brl7.5 million, which is part of our guidance and is an expectation for a better fourth quarter.
by doing our calculations, we do hope that part of these effects that have hampered the steel industry and mining, will be reverted and we hope the fourth quarter will be even better. when we compare this to the second quarter, we'll see what happened business-by-business. and steel in the internal market, everything remained the same; cost, margin and volumes. and what made the difference were the volumes in the foreign market as we will see further on. that is why we had a drop in our ebitda.
in mining, we've said and will continue to reiterate the realization of prices and volume. when we look at the business unit separately, we did not sell 700 tons of iron ore. and of course, this also had an impact on mining and they should be reverted in the fourth quarter. in other businesses, we have both positive and negative aspects in cement, a new drop in ebitda. what is relevant is that we had a great reaction in terms of volume.
the civil construction market has presented us with good news. we have, had a double-digit growth. the result was not stronger simply because the cost of cement was impacted by the cost of service. we have now a more expensive processing and this has affected our results. despite this, we got to that brl1.6 million. we hope this will be the prelude for even better figures in the fourth quarter.
on page number five, you will see the capex. our cash flow capex is quite in -- aligned with what we have planned, a peak in this quarter of brl600 million, because of the efforts devoted to the maintenance of the blast furnace number three. it involves other areas such as sintering, and this represents disbursements and services that attained brl603 million. in accordance with our guidance, that is approximately brl2 billion. this capex is extremely welcome. it will allow us to have a cost of slab that will be brl300, lower per ton already in the fourth quarter after the renovation of the blast furnace. and the production volumes as well by the pre-renovation, we had a bottleneck.
we were limited to a production of 330 million, 340 million tons of steel. with this renovation, we should be able to reach 400 million tons. and this is a peak, but the pay-back will take place in some months. and once again, this is higher because of the filtering dam projects, that are doing very well. thank you. we already have the results and the record in mining production as we will see. that is why we have attained those brl2 billion. the coming year, the capex should be somewhat lower.
we continue on with working capital, this was a quarter for normalization. we have gone back to the 51 days. in the second quarter, we had higher stocks and higher periods for trace receivables and a concentration of sales at the end of the quarter. now all of this has been normalized in this third quarter, as the platts price was more stable and we have not had a concentration of sales.
trade receivables have dropped. and as planned, our inventories were reduced as we roll the slabs spot from third-parties. along with our management of suppliers, we had a reduction in these three items, suppliers and others of brl1.2 billion, quite significant to show you the cash flow that is positive in brl389 million. it hasn't been stronger, because we had a significant cash disbursement in terms of income tax. it was a effect lagging after the second quarter. and of course, there -- all of this has been offset. we have a cash flow of brl389 million, if we look going forward with our profitability normalized, the cash flow for the fourth quarter will be much greater.
we continue on to page number six. now this cash was important but insufficient to avoid an increase in our debt. the indebtedness reached brl26 million and the great villain here is the foreign exchange devaluation, representing brl1.3 billion increase in our debt. our debt is 60% pegged to the dollar, which is very good for us, because of our sale abroad. now this was the main effect.
and another effect was the payout of dividends. we now have a policy of paying our dividends every quarter, always in-line with a minimum mandatory amount of 25% for the period, this was done this quarter. and because of the dividends of minority shares, this amounted to brl603 million. because of this, the net-debt did not drop and the net debt ebitda ratio stood at 3.8. and the comment here is that we are very confident that we will attain our goal of 3 times net debt ebitda at the end of the year very close to that. and in the medium-term, we will have a net debt of brl20 million. once again, none of this has stopped being a priority for the company. and a cash flow with the sale of assets will enable us to attain what we have informed the market.
on page number seven, the other dimension of our efforts in term of the balance, which is the quality of our debt. the average term that has been addressed, not only through the capital market. this quarter, we had one more emission of the 2023 retap, lengthening our bond for 2019. this was paid on september 2019 and have lengthened the debt for another four years. this with the support of significant foreign banks like the bank of china and local banks such as bradesco, that have extended our debt for a period going beyond four years.
and the focus, of course is the capital market. if we compare our balance with other companies in the sector, we have a very strong concentration on banks, and we would like to diversify, avoiding the -- well, taking advantage of the low interest rate. and our next incursion will be in debentures, taking advantage of improvements in our rating as well.
to continue on with the highlights, we go on to page number nine. that refers to our steel performance. once again, this was a atypical quarter where steel represented a very low amount of our total ebitda. and we are the national steel company, the national mining company, and steel has always represented 60% of our results. therefore, this quarter is abnormal. repeating what happened in the second quarter with a very low ebitda. the volumes were very similar in the domestic market because of slabs at a price brl300 more per ton. by looking forward, we think we have -- we'll have an enhancement in all fronts. there should be a resumption of volumes. there is good news from civil construction and packaging, capital goods and other sectors. and with this economic recovery, perhaps we will no longer have discounts on imported products.
now both of these elements should help, but especially the costs. after the maintenance of the blast furnace, the cost per slab should drop and this will represent brl100 million per month, in terms of costs when we return to normalcy. what was different this quarter was a weaker foreign sector. once again, due to seasonality, the blast furnace in germany with a stop-down. of course, these are not fully comparable. but in the us and portugal, we had lower prices for briquette and we held back our sales. this is what has led to having lower results in the foreign market. it has been a transitional quarter. we hope to redress this in the fourth quarter.
in terms of the mining performance on page 10, we look at the results. the second best in history, vis-a-vis the second quarter of '19. this is an excellent moment for mining. we can celebrate some of our figures such as the production volume, which has been a historical record. it shows that we were right in investing in filtering and dry-stacking.
however, this semester, this has not translated into larger sales, because we sold a lower amount to opb [phonetic] because of the blast furnace. and of course this has also helped us to reduce our revenues, and that is why the results are different from the second quarter. the main reason that we see in the last page, on page number 11, was the price, the pricing. the revenues had a drop due to volumes but mainly because of prices. now the explanation here, is the platts as an average index, remained stable or dropped two, but our realization dropped 13%.
now where does this drop come from? first-of-all, due to the basket of quotation periods, these are sales that we carry-out through a provision based on the spot price of platts. now when the iron ore gets to china, this price may have either increased or decreased. in july, for example, the prices were extremely steep. but there was a big drop in august. because of this, we had a provision of quotation periods with an impact of $8, vis-a-vis the reference.
while we are aware of what happened with quality, this is a one-time issue. and this has nothing to do with the granulated ore and others and this also refers to the offers of concentrated products in china, where we will see a reduction in coming months and the use of these low-contaminant iron ores. all of this has had an impact, but we think that this will be temporary. what is also temporary? is the freight that reached $29, almost $30. we are now returning to $18 or $19. in terms of price realization, this has an impact and it should be mitigated in the fourth quarter. and this explains the reduction of revenue in mining.
with this, we get to the end of the presentation, and i'd like to offer the floor to our ceo and chairman, benjamin steinbruch, before we go on to the questions.
benjamin steinbruch -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
a good morning to all of you and thank you very much for the presence of analysts. i'd like to begin by stating that i don't want to sound overly positive. but the results of the third quarter were good, and all of the drops can be justified. they're not abstract conceptual issues. they are simply numerical issues and you and the investors can come to their own conclusion. it was to be a much better quarter, to continue on with what we had shown you in the previous quarters were it not for those highly justifiable events or factors.
from the viewpoint of commitment to reduce our debt, the commitment remains unaltered. we did have the impact because of the blast furnace number three, we had an impact in the purchase of slabs. we paid at 30 days. our cycle is normally 180 days. and in december, we should be able to recompose our cash. we have the payout of dividends. as you know, the depreciation of the real, that was quite strong with a one-time impact. this is diluted through time, but it does have an impact. and that issue in mining, as we sold two-thirds going forward and one-third in the past, the sales of the consortium and the sale of iron ore to japan and korea are based on the previous quarter. and two-third refer to spot sales to china, and they're carried out with the prices open for the coming month.
we benefited from the increase of the sale of these two-thirds of our volume. when we are -- when there was a reduction of price, we were hampered, of course. this was the impact of the previous quarter. and as of this moment, we have the advantage of the one-third. and there is no longer a penalty because the price has already been updated with the two-third that we sell in the spot market in the future markets for sale to china. along with this, the price of freight reached $29. we are back to $19.
we purchased freight month after month and the average price was very competitive this year. we got it right in future sales in freight. this adjustment had to take place. it did. we are now closing freight deals for the end of the year at $18 or $19. and we believe, we will be at 90. and with this, we will end the year in mining that will be exceptional. we will sell 40 million tons. 33 million tons, we'll produce ourselves at a competitive price and with the right quality. so our mining business has been structured for the good times and the bad times as well.
we are covered when it comes to dams. environmentally, we're fully updated, and we are aware of all of our dams and what is happening. we have been living and working with them for the last 30, 40 years. there are no novelties. we think that we have full control over this. and when it comes to the cost structure, we're ever more competitive.
in terms of iron ore, we have equalized the quality. and with a good market, we will gain a great deal. with a bad market, we will also gain. in steel, we have that problem with blast furnace number three. this is the heart of steel, and not being able to produce slabs, has led us to buy slabs from third parties at more than brl500. nowadays, we purchase slabs at brl360. and we are going to go in with a good average price for the fourth quarter, when it comes to slabs. and once the blast furnace is operational, we have resolved the problem of costs. we think that the market allows us to be optimistic. it hasn't been easy. it is difficult, but we see market enhancements.
and i'm going to pressure martinez to end the year without an inventory. we do observe a resumption in terms of civil construction. the fgts, the 13 salary, the decrease in interest rate, allow us to think that we will have a good fourth quarter in terms of consumption. and this will enable us to have a good replenishment of inventory in the first quarter 2020. despite all of the difficulties, we look upon the brazilian economy with optimism.
now the issue of interest, the drop in interest rate has been very positive for us. we've plans for the domestic market and foreign market. we are expecting a revaluation of rating companies. we had dropped seven levels in six months. and in the last two years, we have been able to recover three of these levels. as always, the rating agencies allow you to drop a great deal, but the return to normalcy is difficult, and we are waiting for this before issuing our debentures.
we have the debentures for energy, for the ports, and we are going to use that artifice of incentivated debentures to obtain better rates. and the issue of cement will improve because of the resumption of civil construction. and we are betting on the following that everything has been done.
when i say that the results of the third quarter are good, it is because we don't need to change anything, everything is doing well. we had those one-time issues that can easily be explained. but our direction or path is the same. the decisions are the same. they have been made. and as part of what we offered in terms of commitment, we have the debt reduction. and a great part of this will be attained in the fourth quarter, with or without the sale of assets.
this is a priority, one of our greatest concerns. if i have to pay -- sell part of the mining to reach a more comfortable position, i'll do this. 8% will be readily available for sales and this is one of my desires. it's not the market, it's not due to analysts or -- otherwise, it is a desire that i have. it is not because of 8% of mining that i will not be able to have that tranquility and begin to go on perennially.
this is a minor effort compared to all of the gains that we will have, and this will be done one way or another. notwithstanding this, i hope to live very long. and i know, that everything has a right time and we're waiting for that right time to come about. but csn, from the business viewpoint, has done very well. we have nothing that we would like to change. i do believe we are on the right path. we are going to deliver what we have promised. i'm very insistent in terms of this and the fourth quarter will have to be much better and recover part of what happened in the third quarter.
we are optimistic and we believe that the fourth quarter '19, will mirror or achieve everything we did not achieve in the third quarter. and we are prepared to continue on with our commitments in the year 2020. we want to have a more deleveraged company with the benefit of that potential for growth, which means we can grow in steel, in mining, in cements and infrastructure, as well as in energy.
we are prepared for this. we haven't done so yet because we have that commitment of delevering. as soon as, we attain an adequate level once more, we will be prepared to resume our growth. the lengthening of the debt has been done in the holding, as well as in the company, and the dividends were significant because of this. we could not have a company with a lengthening of debt and feel pressure at the holding. this was a sacrifice that we did -- because we did analyze this. we were able to lengthen both, we are in a more comfortable position at present. we should have greater ease going forward.
this is what i wanted to mention, and we now offer you the floor. all of the executive directors are at your disposal including myself. i do highlight once again that the events in the third quarter are easily justifiable. the impact on prices for an extremely short period of time, we will recover in the fourth quarter and present better results.
thank you very much. we will now go on to the question-and-answer session for investors and analysts.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question will be in english and comes from carlos de alba from morgan stanley.
carlos de alba -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hello good morning everyone. thank you very much. the first question is on iron ore sales. could you help me understand why we saw a drop in volumes? i understand the comments that marcelo made, regarding the fact that you sold less to volta redonda. but the maintenance or the stoppage of the blast furnace have been scheduled for some time. and presumably, the company would have planned this ahead of time and still be able to sell those volumes to third parties.
so could you please help us understand, if there was any issues with availability of ships or something at the port? or just that the market wasn't there for the company to keep the 10.1 or 10.point something million tons of shipments in the quarter? and second, if i may ask, just on the progression of the lower steel cost. i think, marcelo mentioned the expectation of a brl300 per ton decline in slab cost. is this something that you expect to see already in the third quarter? or is going to -- sorry in the fourth quarter? or it's going to be a smooth delivery of this lower cost?
and then finally, if i may, what are the trends that you expect on working capital? we saw a big decline in receivables in the third quarter. inventories remain-high. i suppose that inventories will decline in the fourth quarter just as the normalization of the steel business takes place. but what about receivables, a huge benefit in the third quarter. how do you see that going forward? thank you very much.
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
carlos, good morning, and thank you very much for your questions. this is eneas. allow me to explain what happens in terms of production and volume. this is a quarter, where we had strong production. we used 500 million tons to 600 million tons. we reduced our purchase volumes. as a result, we had 600 million tons, which is a challenge that will be transferred to the fourth quarter. now the result of this level of operations is due to timely logistic problems and the market volatility. and because of this, we're not able to sell out this product, and this will be done with greater challenges in the fourth quarter.
to confirm our expectation of 40 million tons in sales, the fourth quarter will offset the lower sales volume in the third quarter. we'd like to clarify that we have had no problems in selling iron ore. the demand exists, it is a commodity. we always have a market for it. it is simply a price and availability issue. we are going into the fourth quarter with a very good inventory. we are going to pressure luis martinez to deliver zero-inventory, and ons [phonetic] will also have to deliver a zero-inventory. we have orders, we have the port. the product has been stopped. so we should have an excellent fourth quarter when it comes to our profit and because of the inventories that will enable us to offset the third quarter.
pedro gutemberg quariguasi netto -- executive officer
a question about the cost of slabs. this is pedro gutemberg, carlos. thank you for the question. we think the cost of slab will be brl300, lower vis-a-vis this last quarter. and this is the price of iron ore, brl1,100 and some per ton. this is a preliminary estimate that will be confirmed with the data from our input.
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
and pedro gutemberg knows we are buying slab at $340. we're not traders, we are an industry. this is the market benchmark. and dr. gutemberg will have to make efforts to get to that price in terms of cost. we simply have to comply with this. he refers the brl300, we are going to pressure to obtain more than brl300, and the market serves as a guidance for us. and as part of that guidance and effective purchasing prices in one way or another, we have to get to that reality. we cannot buy at a lower price than we produce. and so we're going to try to achieve this level, discounting the fiscal credits that some brazilian plants benefit from.
another important issue to enable you to produce your models. let us imagine a cost of slab at brl1,850. a conversion cost of $60 from bq to slab, we will get to $520 with bq. the average price without pis/cofins is $615. $615 minus $520, will be $95 per ton in the bq, which is not bad at all. and this will put us back at a reasonable level, if we do not have a price correction.
now a better scenario. the other half that i sell are coated products, 63% of our portfolio. and we have average prices of three, 550 pre-painted, tin plate, zinced with 321. without pis/cofins, it would represent $805 net minus $660, which is the cost for the galvanized product. i have $150. $150 plus the $95 of the bq gives us $136 per ton versus 300,000 per month, $40 million times four, $160 million, which would be the results we are projecting for the quarter.
now this account -- now these are expectations, not projections. no this is not a projection. this is the reality. i can guarantee the price. at a cost of brl1,850, there is not very much we can do. the price of bq has hit rock bottom, and we are going to guarantee facts and data. $95 in the bq and in other products, where we have 53%, our margin is $200 higher.
by giving the right cost and by working with production levels that are 10% or 15% greater, we are going to be delivering 160 million. this is not a forecast, it's an exercise that we're working on altogether. and this would also extend to the coming year, 2020, when we will capture some of these benefits.
well, martinez will be the phoenix of csn. he will arise from the ashes. now simply to complement, what was said by martinez, with the renovation of the blast furnace, we will have a significant increase in production, 20% to 30% in 2020. this is why we renovated the blast furnace, and this will recompose the steel ebitda.
another question from carlos, refers to working capital and trade receivables. in the fourth quarter, we expect stability, and the effort of course, is to increase sales. our inventory will help our working capital and possible strategies, to offset this when it comes to slab. what we see is an upside risk when it comes to cash generation.
carlos de alba -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question will be in portuguese, and it comes from thiago lofiego from bradesco bbi. you may proceed.
thiago lofiego -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
good morning to all and thank you for the call. i have two questions. we go back to the leveraging cash generations, brl380 million, normalizing. this is a simple account. even with the iron ore price, quite steep at $100, which will be the evolution of your cash generation ex-sale of assets and the leverage of iron ore at lower prices, which is the operational variable, where you can have an enhancement to sustain cash generation and deleveraging, will capex be sufficient, or will you work on another variable?
and as part of this question, if you could also refer to your investments. more specifically, what is happening with wt -- working capital. and if you could speak about the steel market in brazil, martinez, what have you seen in terms of demand? if there is any room to improve the price and what you foresee for the very short-term or the next year in terms of price increases. and of course, there has been a retraction in china, which is a reason of concern.
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
martinez, would you like to begin?
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- commercial officer
thiago, when it comes to the premium, simply to review this, if you want to show the graph, we are beginning from a very adverse situation of chinese via bq of $450, via bf $290. and there is a curve -- a price curve that was never that low. we are getting to a negative peak, when it comes to market prices.
now if we base ourselves on those prices and think about the prices in the domestic market, the premium for bf and bq is approximately 2%, for galvanized raw products 11%; and for other coated products varying between 8% and 10%. there is no possibility in my understanding of importing products with a lower added value. and it is not about imports. imports have dropped, but have had an increase in the galvanized products, and we need to be careful with that.
now when it comes to the csn price strategy, we are imagining that until the end of the year, the scenario will be of price stability. now theoretically, there would be room for a price hike, but i would prefer to say that we are going to work with a stable scenario until the end of the year. when it comes to costs, we've hit rock bottom. once again, we are ready for a resumption, we are going to work at full steam. and as benjamin mentioned, this is what we are doing. we are destocking, and we are going to go through the end of the year with the lowest inventory level of finished products at csn in the last five years.
now our inventory with added value is very strong, 53%. we continue to have 6,000 clients in our customer base. we don't have all of our eggs in the same basket. we are working with assembly plants and other industries and there are some scenarios, such as civil construction and cement. our cement business grew 12% in volume in the third quarter vis-a-vis the second quarter, which clearly shows a resumption in the civil construction segment. very shy, when compared with the potential that we will see with other concessions and infrastructure construction.
now if we look at what is happening at present, there is a drop in automotive industries and in the truck industry. at the beginning of the year, it was positive. for the year 2020 if the gdp reaches 2.53%, there should be a growth of 7% to 8%. our scenario as a whole, therefore is positive. i think there is a general confusion around the world in terms of the price of scrap, and iron ore from china and the usa. and the trend is for stabilization, and this will favor csn. we will be able to compete on equal footing.
when it comes to cash flow, we are not expecting too many changes. this of course has been a special year with a very robust ebitda, but the steel industry is an anchor, once the steel industry enhances, the ebitda will not change very much. we'll have a positive evolution in capex and lower interest rates. this will generate a 1.5 cash flow. and this is what we are hoping for and what we delivered last year and this year.
thiago lofiego -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
at which price level, marcelo?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- chief financial and investor relations officer
well, there is a consensus when it comes to platts. the platts will be at approximately $80 for the year 2020. this is what we have established through a consensus. thiago, when it comes to volumes, it is obvious that the volumes we are producing are not the ones we are used to producing. they should be higher.
now another important side of this coin that refers to the market, simply to give you an idea of what this quarter was and this year was -- we bought from usiminas 160,000 tons. i don't know, if you're aware of this, from arcelor bq 40 and 600,000 tons of slab. now besides, maintaining our market share, we practically did not lose market share. i feel then the pockets of competitors, which is not desirable, we are not used to doing this. we are going to recover this. we are going to bring everything in-house. it makes no sense to buy so much material to service the market. and when this stops, we will go back to our previous results.
i believe there was a question on wt -- swt, when it comes to swt, we can say that the business is still alive and kicking, moving forward and one step ahead. we cannot say, more than this -- these m&a issues? well, we never know about the timing and the possibilities for success. we've been discussing this for mostly a year and this is a serious business. it is moving forward. this is all we can say at present.
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
thank you, martinez. thank you for your responses. thank you. we are now going to go on for the question-and-answer session for the analysts present at the call. now please give us your name and company before posing the question and speak very close to the microphone to guarantee optimum sound quality. please wait while we pool our questions.
leonardo correa -- btg pactual -- analyst
yeah. good morning and thank you. i'm leonardo correa from btg pactual. the first question to martinez, an easier question. there is a thesis of a struggle for market share, specifically in the fourth quarter, the blast furnace coming back into operation. and there is a thesis that competition will become harsher and there will be a price drop. you spoke about stability. but i'd like you to speak about the competitive scenario, which is still very difficult with a scenario of compressed demand and the expectation is that everything will improve in the first quarter or second quarter of 2020.
the rest of my questions are to benjamin. we have seen csn with an evolution in terms of ebitda for two years, a net debt coming to a halt. the csn has had difficulties in deleveraging net debt and has been paying dividends. this is challenging. you were quite assertive at the beginning about the positive sale of casa de pedra, 8% of mining. are there any conversations under way? anything on the radar, or is this something that could come about in 2020?
the second question, we understand the issue of the holding. the holding is leveraged, and you also have a leveraging at the operating plant. my question, is if you would consider selling a part of csn to pay the debt of the holding? so you don't depend so much on the flow of dividends from the operating company to the holding. would you sell part of the share of csn and perhaps suspend the payout of dividends for two or three years?
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
leo, this -- it is not very simple in a very whole-style scenario and with a blast furnace under renovation. when you buy material from third parties, it is not simple to maintain your prices. and what you are looking on is what happened with prices on the average. but we don't live only from the market of low added value. in packaging based on 2018, we're at 114 for packaging. in the industry, we were at 100. in 2014, we are at 104. and there's a minor correction in the distribution market. we have to make this restatement of correction, there will not be that price struggle because we have reached a very low point.
nobody is making money, and the blast furnaces of our competitors are also attempting to optimize cost. and for this, they reduce production, they use less pellets to maximize costs, not output. this is a given. and the outlook for prices that we've for 2020, imagining that the market will have a slight resumption, is a recovery already in the first quarter. i truly thanks to our portfolio in this fourth quarter, do not think of a harsher competition.
december is a seasonable -- seasonal month. there is no price flexibility, and we will have equivalent volumes. so i believe the scenario will be stability. we will work ever more on a stronger portfolio in the galvanized products. our project that has been mentioned frequently is working full steam. we are going to create that galvanization line in sao paulo, with an investment of brl2.5 billion.
presently, we are defining the location and value to paraiba, very close to the markets. and we will have a csn portfolio going from 51%, 52% to 63% of coated products for the coming two-years perhaps in the short-term. and when it comes to the premiums, it is important to observe that the price in china at present, if you look at the cost of raw material, coke and others, the chinese and the steel mills that you accompany have a negative ebitda. i don't believe that the situation, will be maintained for very long. and the usa is going through typical moments, due to the scrap prices that had a higher drop than iron ore. it is below $200 or less. and as the market resumes, we should have a better point of balance.
this is what i believe will happen to prices for the end of the year and for the year 2020. leo, thank you for what you did last night, and i'd like to say that you're going to be happier and work more in this coming quarter. now to respond to your question objectively, we're negotiating the assets in germany, it's simply an issue of price.
now if we have had a year of negotiation, it is because there is interest on the part of the buyer side as well as on ours, the seller side. there is interest and the difficulties will converge, and we are reaching the final stages. now surprisingly, we could sell this in a week or two weeks, or not have any business at all. we are now at a very conclusive stage, when it comes to the possibility of selling off our asset in germany. this is what is happening. regarding those 8% for mining, we have 88%, the asian consortium has 12%.
as you know, during the entire year, we negotiated the streaming. we came very close to working on an operation that was 5%, equivalent to the sale of a streaming operation. now because of the novelty in terms of iron ore, this was lengthened and the operation still has not come out. we are also interested in mining, it is not difficult to sell a good asset with a high ebitda.
now this is the crux of the issue, you have to do your accounts. the market demands from us a mobilization. but, well what we have in europe, could represent brl60 million ebitda or in euros. and this is significant because of the business in itself. it is a positive business with a positive ebitda. it is not difficult to manage, and it does contribute to results.
and we could do the same when it comes to mining. mining will give us brl6 billion in terms of ebitda this year, or something very close to that. so if you do your accounts with this 8% of the brl6.5 billion, you will be servicing, deleveraging, but you will be giving away significant ebitda, and this will be sustainable through time.
as we discussed here, as part of this curve, we are not doing any miracles in terms of prices. it could be $80 or more for the forecast of 2020, $80, $90. but with $80, we will have a very strong ebitda. and we also believe that ebitda will come back constantly in accordance to what we have always delivered.
csn has always been a company known for its very high ebitdas. and we would like to go back to an increase of 30%. we cannot work with less than an ebitda of 30% and this is what we are seeking and we will attain that figure. and i feel somewhat comfortable in terms of our deleveraging because of ebitda. i'm not a dreamer. we are going to deliver brl7.5 billion or brl8 billion in ebitda, something that is very consistent. few brazilian and non-brazilian companies are able to deliver such a positive ebitda in the unstable situation, we see throughout the world and in brazil. therefore, csn speaks for itself.
if you compare what the market most values nowadays compared with csn, none will deliver the ebitda we will deliver. and we are still being strongly penalized because of the past, but not because of the present and not because of the future. a company with the ebitda that csn has had constantly and because of the assets, we may have a drop in mining. but an increase in steel and cement. so we have diversity of very good assets that can present good figures, and they enable us to have the stability, this constancy in terms of our ebitda.
i understand. i do not agree with this, but i have thought that idea of the market of deleveraging. this is a commitment we have made, and we are going to honor it. if we have to sell those 8% of mining, considering the proportionality of ebitda, it will simply be to offer me some comfort to be able to work with a less leveraged company as an entrepreneur, as a businessman and as i have always done, i began by owing everything that i bought from csn. we bought 7% from csn leveraged and we have gotten to that 60% at present. deleveraged, i could say.
now you have expressed the concern with the holding. now the csn dividends policy is regardless of the holding. we are going to deliver the minimum dividends every quarter constantly. now the issue of the holding and the lengthening of our maturities, we are going to resolve with an increase in our price share.
my challenge is to increase the share of csn, not to pay dividends. and i believe we can do this in the short term. a great deal of what csn suffered was due to its high indebtedness. now with the reduction, this appreciation in the share will come very speedily. i do not believe that we have to sell the share of the holding. this is not necessary. if we've to reduce it, we have a great deal of room to do this by selling shares from csn. and once again, we have to do this calculation, see if it is worthwhile.
of course, indebtedness is no longer attractive. i am 66 years old. i do not want to die indebted. i do not want to die at all, but certainly not as an indebted person. but i am fully convinced, as i said that this year, we would reduce the net debt ebitda ratio to less than 3 times. we will only not comply with this, if something happens such as foreign exchange or something different. otherwise, we will be delivering these results. and in the year 2020, we will deleverage down to 2 times, without taking into account the sale of assets and the -- keeping in mind the price curve. once again, prices of iron ore and steel based on what the market wants.
so despite seeming to be a high leverage and although this seems to be an immediate necessity, everything is given. as i mentioned formerly, we have a delivery of results out of the curve, an outlier because of practical results that are well-known. we can detail them and you will be able to calculate this. in the fourth quarter, we are going to revert what happened in the third quarter. and our commitment and our delivery will be toward a deleveraging for a net debt, ebitda ratio of 3 times or below. and with this dividend policy being a given, we are not going to stop paying the 25% mandatory minimum, but we are not going to pay over this either.
daniel sasson -- itau bba -- analyst
good morning and thank you for the question. daniel sasson from itau bba. when it comes to the net debt ebitda of 3 times, at the end of the year and ebitda at brl7.5 billion, you would have to reduce your debt by almost brl5 million between the third and fourth quarter. what are you expecting in terms of sale of assets, cash generation and reduction of debt? thanks to foreign exchange appreciation, as part of this question for benjamin, if the end of the year will be a 3 times net debt ebitda ratio, which will be the level of tranquility that you mentioned at the beginning of your address.
the second question referring to csn investments, if we could have more color and a ranking of priorities. martinez referred to your new galvanized line, the expansion of mining. what is it that the company will do first? or can you do all of this simultaneously? has the line of galvanized products been approved at board level? and which is the status and the timing that we could work with in terms of these investments? thank you.
benjamin steinbruch -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
we will begin with the ratio. we expect brl3 billion from financial initiatives, m&as and-or new iron ore deals, brl500 million of reduction based on foreign exchange. the rest will come from the business. now which are the investments, which is a very broad question. in mining, there is an expansion project that has been approved and is under way with 10 million tons, that will begin to be built in 2020. and of course, this is different from the plant of galvanized products.
the governments in the state of rio and sao paulo are supporting us. in sao paulo, we have a memorandum of understanding, that is quite advanced, but we need to be able to reach the right conditions in terms of funding. but we do have support for this. what is sustainable, what is comfortable because of our type of business would be 2 times net debt ebitda. less than this would not be very intelligent. i find this comfortable, ebitda of 3.5 times. net debt ratio is comfortable because of the capital-intensive activity that we have and the diversification of commodities and products.
i have already mentioned this. i went abroad, and i was surprised with the market demand and the lack of stability. now this account of 3.5 times, for a stable or predictable market would be comfortable. but because of what we see worldwide in terms of political economic instability and because of those sudden oscillations, make people request a lower indebtedness a lower ratio. that is why i have made a commitment to deliver this reduction, 3 times -- this year and the coming year, 2 times. and ensuing that, we will have a certain comfort.
it would not be intelligent on our part to abuse the market. and another trend that we are working on is to move away from bank credits and obtain this from the market. now if we do this abroad or locally, the terms will be much longer. therefore, when i speak about this net debt ebitda ratio of 2 times, this will be with a lengthened period, which gives us even greater comfort and moving away from commercial bank loans in the short-term.
this is what we are working toward. and i believe we can comply with this strategy at the end of the year 2020.
gabriela cortez -- bb-banco de investimento -- analyst
good morning, gabriela from bank of brazil. martinez, i have a question regarding the price scenario for the coming year. you're pointing to a scenario that is somewhat discrepant toward what we have. we have a global de-acceleration, and we think, this will have an impact on demand and prices. you have proven to be more positive. so what is it that you are thinking about these two factors?
now for eneas in terms of the pricing of iron ore from csn, what do you expect for the fourth quarter? are you expecting a discount for silica, lower freights? what is it that we can expect in terms of prices?
benjamin steinbruch -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
benjamin, well, we had somebody that was 93 years old this year. so you do have a great deal of time. simply to conclude and the issue of investment is important for analysts and for the market. csn has investments under way that are investments that will bring a significant return in a very short-term operational adjustment. and all of this has been done and we analyze them in terms of the return for the company.
we are always attentive to opportunities. any large investment that you do in steel, in mining or cement in the best of hypothesis, if everything works out, you have 18 or 24 months for approval. so when we speak about a possible new galvanized plant or a new cement plant, if we speak about the expansion of casa de pedra, to be able to do this environmentally and in fiscal-terms, we cannot make this happen before those 18 months or 24 months.
and this is something i would like to clarify. my sister, for example, who is a shareholder, called me yesterday. it was said in the newspapers in aracaju that we were investing in a cement plant because there was a public hearing for the environment. and i called her back and i said in the best of hypothesis, if everything works out, it will take us 18 months or 24 months to begin.
and of course, in that case, if we deliver what we have committed to this year and the coming year, csn in 2021 will have that net debt ebitda ratio of 2 times, allowing us to begin moving forward. now we have to begin doing all of this before. and you should know that nothing expressive will be happening before that 18 month period. production adjustments, intelligent investments with a large return, that, yes, we will continue doing, but nothing that may cause a concern financially.
gabriela, to speak about the prices, from now on to the end of the year, a scenario of stability. we are beginning to negotiate a price increase for automotive assembly plants for 2020. we are renegotiating all of the contracts of car parts, the automobile industry and some companies where we have six-month contracts, the white appliances, some industrial sectors, where we maintain our prices for specific periods.
for the year 2020, we will be able to capture increases and the enhancement of the results in csn will come from cost and not due to a recomposition of price, as happened in 2018. if we look at the sector as a whole, if you look at the balance of distributors, we could not live in a sector without profitability as a whole. not either the plant or the distributors are making money and we have lost the market logic. everything is wrong. we seem to resume toward something that is more coherent, something with reasonable profit, profitability and a more sustainable value chain. therefore, prices can no longer drop.
the coming year, there will be a positive trend in industry and distribution that buys a great deal of bq and bf. the premium is negative. we have never had a negative premium. perhaps 17 years ago, it was much lower as a premium. nowadays and theoretically, we should be at 5%, no longer 20%, as we had in the past. 5% would be reasonable. it will depend on demand, on the exchange rate and on the performance of industrial chains.
but i think, that the greatest profitability leverage for csn will be the cost, and we will do whatever possible in this field. now the composition of cost at csn is important, which is our basket for sales; 20% for europe; 20%, japan and korea with a semester lagging and 60% to china on the date of arrival of the ship. we had a drop of $30 in iron ore and this impacted us on this third quarter. and freight, we had freight of $29, $30, while the expectation is to have a reduction in freight.
for the fourth quarter, we expect a platts with an increase in prices, possibly why iron ore at $120 has motivated several plants to go back to production in china. all of the iron ore companies have a loss. so there is a trend for an adjustment, a flat price with a lower freight cost, premiums coming back. this is what we hope for the fourth quarter, a large volume of sales. this is a challenge. so the expectation within the scenario is to have better results in terms of prices.
caio ribeiro -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. caio ribeiro from credit suisse. i have two short questions. the first referring to investments and the investments, which will be the timing and the execution of your sale of stake at usiminas? and what is happening in terms of your project and which are the necessary disbursements for csn?
the second question goes to benjamin. you mentioned that you have rolled the holding debt. i would like to know what this represents because year after year, you have been rolling the amortization of the debentures. and i'd like to know if this debt rolling means a better negotiation or if you are postponing these installments for the coming year for 2020? thank you.
eneas garcia diniz -- executive officer
regarding usiminas, there are no secrets. it is a market issue, and the market isn't there. so this will not be happening in the short term, but it is there as an asset that we would like to sell-off, and it will help us in the deleveraging. in terms of the nordestina product, it is a commitment of csn through a constructive negotiation with the government.
we plan to reinitiate works, create employment and services with an investment of brl250 million. and csn is ensuring that this will happen in the short-term to be able to reestablish public funding that up to recently, had come to a standstill. but what csn did was this gesture to reestablish the funding that had already been contracted and had come to a standstill. this is what we have negotiated with the government.
in terms of the holding, well marcello referred to usiminas; i would love to sell usiminas. unfortunately, i have to await the right price. the same with germany, if we get the right price, we will sell it. and usiminas is no longer part of the company's strategy. at the right time, we will dispose of this asset.
when it comes to the holding, marcos is here. we have lengthened this for '22, '23 or '21, '22, what happened there? seven years, two of grace period, five of principal and semestral payments to pay the interest rates. for those who did not hear this, that debenture is a debenture that in its emission works with rieke [phonetic]. it's on the site iaco.com. this is where you will be able to find all of the details on this debenture. it is a definite lengthened debenture with an interest rate grace period of two years.
now from the viewpoint of the holding, this was something definite when i said that we had resolved the situation, because this separates anything from the holding. the controlling company and the controlled company and transnordestina, we are putting forward this gesture of goodwill. we would like to reinitiate the works. we have offered 2 million to get to paes landim in piaui where, regardless of going forward, we would already be able to obtain cargo in paes landim in piaui. and we will conclude that stretch to piaui and then begin to work on that stretch to ceara and up to fortaleza.
once again, this is a gesture of goodwill, and we have the commitment of the government, from sudene and the bank of the northeast to make allocations in this work site and we will hold this conversation in a timely way, with the government, once again to work with our resources and those coming from the government as well.
antonio neto -- bank of merrill lynch -- analyst
antonio heluany from bank of america. the first question to marcelo. in the last quarter, you had some questions from the analysts, when it comes to your cash reconciliations. you had additional costs and some questions on your cash generation. and the question in terms of your capex for 2020, if you could give us more color, what do you have budgeted? what will come from steel, from mining and expansion?
and the last question to pedro regarding the blast furnace renovation. which were the surprises when you began on this work? and which will be the blast furnace ramp-up going forward?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- chief financial and investor relations officer
in terms of the difference, we have a definition of working capital associated to the business, which is inventory, suppliers and trade receivables and a broader line at csn that involves all of the current asset lights. the first had a gain of brl1.2 billion, especially trade receivables, with a drop in inventory. what impacted cash was brl400 million lower, brl750 million, approximately. now this difference can be explained by two lines, brl150 million, an amortization of the prepayment deliveries that we do to glencore, where we have already received the cash in the past.
i pause here because this is temporary, because new prepayment operations will be done in the core -- short-term. and brl150 million are taxation credits, temporary differences, for example for the acquisition of slabs that we bought in the local market, with our credit of icms. there is a balance that will be subsequently consumed. these are the main differences in terms of working capital.
now it is premature to speak about the capex for 2020. it will be 10% or 15% below the one of this year. we still do not have a complete breakdown for this.
pedro gutemberg quariguasi netto -- executive officer
antonio, good morning. regarding the blast furnace question. when you carry out renovations in the blast furnace, you have some alternatives. one of them is when you have the outflow of the pit iron in the blast furnace, and you have this alternative. what happened is that we had a higher volume of residues and it was more difficult to carry out the cleaning to be able to reconstruct this area.
our decision therefore when faced with this decision was to transform a threat into an opportunity. we saw that this blast furnace would have a delay in maintenance. we made the most of the opportunity, carried out other low-cost works that were very important in our sintering machines and in the steel mill, and the greatest cost was the cost of opportunity of not having production.
i think, this was the decision that we took when we discovered that there were more residues than expected in the blast furnace. regarding the ramp-up, if everything goes according to plans, between sunday and monday, we will restart the blast furnace. there is a 10-day curve, where we have an increase of production, a gradual and controlled increase. we have to be very cautious with this. and on november 10 or 15, we do believe we will return to a normal production, a higher production as mentioned than the one we had before the blast furnace stoppage. now this is what we have planned for the start-up again of this blast furnace number 3.
operator
thank you. as we have no further questions, we would like to return the floor to mr. ribeiro, the cfo and iro officer for his final remarks. i give the floor to our chairman for closing remarks.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- chief financial and investor relations officer
i would like to thank all of you. we will repeat this model, which we think is very propitious. it enables us to meet, to speak prior and subsequently to the call, perhaps at a different schedule, 8:30, 9:00. you can have breakfast with us. we can hold a conversation, present results and everybody can return to work at 10:30. this is the ideal model.
and with excellent figures, i truly hope to be here. i'll be here to present what we have set forth to present annually and for the quarter. we are on the right path. we have taken the right decisions. you always have difficulties, one-time problems, and we need to resolve them and continue moving forward. our intention is to have a modern and transparent company with state-of-the-art technology producing diversified added-value products. this is our quest. this is our day-to-day to guarantee that all of our directors and employees are working in an attuned way. csn sets itself aside in the market. we should have a profit of brl26 billion, with an ebitda between brl7.5 billion and brl8 billion. and i think, this speaks for itself. everything that might seem somewhat hyperbolic or overly optimistic, we are delivering.
if you look at the billing of csn, it has always grown. in the last few years, we work fully, we do not have lay-offs. we have continued to work despite the market difficulties and difficulties in working capital, paying the expressive interest rates at brazil. we have never laid-off employees. we have had consistent ebitda. this is what motivates us and propels us forward, so that we can have a more streamlined company geared to the market to favor both its shareholders and employees. thank you very much and until january of 2020 or perhaps february or march. well, the better the results, the sooner our call next year. thank you very much.

operator
good morning and thank you for waiting. welcome to csn's conference call to present the results for the second quarter of 2021. today, we have with us the company's executive officers. [operator instructions] we have simultaneous webcast that may be accessed through csn's investor relations website at ri.csn.com.br/en/, where the presentation is also available. the slide presentation may be downloaded from the same website. please feel free to flip through the slides during the conference call. before proceeding, we would like to declare that some of the statements herein are mere expectations or trends and are based on the current assumptions and opinions of the company's management and that future results, performance and events may differ materially from those expressed herein, which do not constitute projections.
in fact, actual results, performance or events may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, such as the general and economic conditions in brazil and other countries, interest rates and exchange rate levels, future rescheduling or prepayment of debt denominated in foreign currency, protectionist measures in the u.s., brazil and in other countries, changes in laws and regulations and general competitive factors on a global, regional or national level.
now i'll turn the conference over to mr. marcelo cunha ribeiro, investor relations executive officer, who will present the company's operating and financial highlights for the period. please, mr. marcelo, you may begin your presentation.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you for participating in this conference call. this is yet another call in a quarter of very good numbers, very good news. we will start this presentation on page number two with the highlights for the period, mentioning a record ebitda. and practically, all the financial metrics of the company reached record numbers except for the net income, where the number of the -- of quarter one was even higher. but at the time, it was impacted by the ipo of csn mineracao. at this time, it was brl five billion of net income and with excellent operational results. it's a historical number. however, it's a short history because with such positive trends in terms of prices and costs, we are expecting that the next coming quarters are even better. so this has allowed us to reach some leverage targets that were expected only for the end of the year, but we were able to bring our leverage to very low levels. we even reduced the net debt to less than brl50 billion, and we inaugurated a new phase in the company's journey. we are now focusing more on capital reallocation.
so the highlights of this quarter mark the start of this phase with the purchase of main plant inaugurating the investment strategy of csn in this industry. on slide number three, we see the evolution of our ebitda numbers. with the sixth consecutive quarter of record growth, reaching brl8.2 billion and a margin of 53%. and in less than one year, we had an 80% lower ebitda. so this growth was achieved in record time. and practically, in all segments of the company contributing to the positive results of this quarter, in particular, and the greatest growth was seen in steel making due to some cost-related factors, price-related factors. and in nominal terms, mining grew more than brl1.3 billion and the cement business all reached record numbers in terms of volume, revenues and profitability. so we grew 40% or brl2.4 billion in one single quarter. next page, we have our cash flow indicators with very good news about our capex advancement, and it's growing where it needs to grow in mining. this was what was forecast for the year. and in this quarter, we have already delivered the purchase of very important assets such as the magnetic concentrator number three project that will allow for improvement in production quality, and we have a guidance for the year of brl three billion. regarding our net working capital, it grows in the period very much due to the very healthy evolution of prices and volumes.
this led us to growth in our stock account. and this was partially compensated by the growth of our suppliers and also one event, which was the dividend payout during this period. on page number five, we see how this is leading to cash generation and our adjusted -- record adjusted cash flow of brl5.4 billion. also, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. and in this quarter, it reached high levels despite the impact of the growing capex according to the equations and also the variation in the working capital and the financial -- one-off financial expenses, for example, the ore hedge and other financial operations such as the bonus -- the bonus buyback. and on page number six, we see how this very pronounced cash generation resulted in a very fast drop in net debt. in this quarter, also supported by the exchange rate, the devaluation of the dollar and valuation of the real against the dollar, which brought our debt down to lower levels. and the sales of usiminas shares, the brl1.3 billion coming from this operation, which compensated the dividend payout of brl900 million.
so our net debt dropped by 35% in one single quarter, reaching below the brl15 billion, which was the target. and now we see it as a ceiling of our net debt and the leverage was also 1.6% also below the new ceiling that we have. a topic that we still have to address is the gross debt, which was brl35 billion in this quarter, positively impacted in this quarter by the loan with nexi of $350 million to support the growth of the mining business. on page number seven. we see how the gross debt issue will be addressed in the very short term. today, we are announcing the buyback of the perpetual bonuses, $1 billion or brl five billion, which added to the buyback of the bonus from 2023 and the prepayment of banking debt will allow us to decrease by more than brl10 billion of gross debt in the next coming months, reinforcing the very responsible capital structure of the company which has contributed to a very fast increase in our credit ratings, which reached the bb flat and are on the right track for improvement in the future.
now i will go over the financial indicators for each segment. on page number nine, we have steel. and we see that in terms of volume, we sold everything that we had. so the demand, both from the external and domestic markets are still very strong. we saw an unexpected recovery in non-localized recovery reaching all segments from automotive, civil construction, everything related with agribusiness and packaging. martinez will go into more details about the performance of the sector. but what really contributed to the profitability this quarter was the price evolution. our company -- the international market and the cost evolution in this quarter, 26% up which led the ebitda to brl2.7 billion and a margin of 33%. regarding our operational performance on page 10, we see the slab production in this quarter was focally impacted by the anticipation of a 60-hour maintenance. that's why we had a slightly lower slab reduction. and of course, this has an impact on the dilution of fixed costs.
but this is a one-off event that we had this quarter, together with increasing prices of raw materials, such as coal and ore. we had an increase of 25% of the cost in reals. this was more than offset by the increase in sales and the increase in the average price. so the ebitda per ton reached brl2,107, which is a historical record for the company. now for mining on page 12, we also have a record-breaking quarter supported by good sales volumes, which could even have been better considering that production exceeded the sales and we accumulated stocks due to problems of port efficiency that we had this quarter, partially impacted by maintenance and rainfall. so we had the stock to make the most of this good price moment, and we were very positively impacted by an excellent price realization. there was a 26% increase in our price and the market indicators were only 20%, which shows the quality of the ore that we sell. that's why our net revenue increased by 34%.
the ebitda increased by 36%, reaching record-breaking margins close to 70%. for the cement business, we are also going through a very unique moment and not just csn, but the market as a whole is going through a renaissance period with increases year after year in the national volumes. recent data show that the trend will continue, and csn has reached maximum production. so we have capacity of about 4.6 million tons, 4.7 million tons, and we are expecting to reach these volumes in the next few quarters. and making the most of the good price increase, the revenues also have reached record numbers with good operational performance and dilution of fixed costs. we reached record margins of 43%, reaching an ebitda of brl147 million for the period. so these were the operational indicators for each business. and on page 15, we will give you an update about our strategic priorities.
in the past three or four years, we communicated to the market based on priorities related with an operational turnaround, which we have reached and also reduction of our debt which we also were able to achieve. and now turning the page, and now we will start talking much more about efficient and disciplined capital allocation, so the cash generation to be well delivered to generate returns to our shareholders, but also conservatively. so we will always maintain this low leverage below the onetime level and high liquidity, which has always been a characteristic of csn. the second pillar is innovation. i'm going to show you the progresses that we have been achieving through csn inova and third, our esg agenda, the new pillar, the new esg pillar, which is gaining traction in our company at very impressive speeds.
so just a brief update on each of these pillars. on page 16, i'll start with our capital allocation. capital allocation will mean growth with opportunities. organic growth in the case of mining, in the case of cement, we will grow through new plants and also sector consolidation. so in the case of the elizabeth cimentos plant, this shows us that we are actually implementing this capital allocation strategy. it's a modern and integrated plant in the northeast of the country, a region we have better prices than in the southeast, which diversifies our presence and brings us potential synergies, very strong potential synergies related with our strategy, our commercial activities, our differentiators, our capacity to gain scale, reduce costs through working with supplies. so this demonstrates that we are really willing to grow fast in the cement business. and this is still under analysis by the cade, but we expect to have this approval in the next few weeks.
regarding the csn inova pillar, one innovation that we have for this quarter is the first, we have the demonstration of csn's commitment to innovation by increasing the resources available to this pillar. so csn inova had a fund of brl30 million, and now it has brl100 million available, considering the very good results of the first initiatives that we have implemented, analyzing start-ups that could add value to csn. and the first venture is 2d materials, a company from singapore, one of the pioneer companies in developing graphene, a material that can be used for several applications which has a lot of synergy with our steel and cement businesses. so the founder of the company got a noble prize and was one of the people responsible for developing graphene and they are bringing diversified knowledge and expertise. they learn a lot about how to improve their own products and it will allow us to enter new verticals.
and as for esg, i will ask our esg director, helena guerra, to talk about the updates in this area.
helena guerra -- head of sustentability, health, safety and enviromental affairs
good morning, everyone. first of all, we would like to announce the publication of our integrated report for 2020 with a little bit of csn's history. csn just celebrated its 80th anniversary. so this was our first integrated annual report. it brings the largest number of indicators ever reported by csn and the main events and results of the past year in terms of financial management, economic aspects, environmental aspects of our five segments: mining, logistics, energy, cement. this was outsourced to an independent company. according to cvm's construction, 14 of 2020, so i invite you all to read the report, which is already available on our platforms on csn's site. and in this quarter, we also concluded tcfd, and this is all available in the global emission record. and this was all prepared according to the ghg methodology. and for the seventh consecutive year, we got the golden stamp.
also we concluded our disclosure inside action about our environmental and climate-related performance, water capture, supply chain. all this information is also available to all investors through this very important platform, cdp. in this quarter, we also had the start of the training of our executive officers and other members of the staff. the construction of our risk metrics and climate opportunities metrics which allows us to venture and incorporate the impact of our climate-related initiatives in our financial reports. we also have grupo clima, a forum with many executives in different areas that will allow us to discuss and supervise implementation of initiatives related with our decarbonization road map. and we are also using an ai tool that creates an imaginary curve showing the results of all -- projected for all projects. so it allows us to calculate the impact of the emissions that will be avoided.
and in the end of this year, we will have new targets, even more ambitious and aggressive targets than what we presented in our initial plan. and also in addition to what we already said today regarding innovation, we also -- csn and csn mineracao, signed an mou with itochu corporation for a decarbonization agenda and digital transformation of csn mineracao to study and develop new technologies for low carbon steel production through the use of hydrogen and other technology. so this has been a very productive quarter, very important quarter for our esg agenda. in the safety pillar, i always say that we can't have a good operational result if we don't have a good safety results. that's why we always talk insisting -- and talking about safety and being the best year historically in terms of operational safety. we closed the quarter with very good rates. in the first quarter, we also had the best historical level of our reportable accident rate.
we had a slight increase in the quarter two, but we are accumulating a reduction of nearly 9% year-over-year and 2020 had already been the best year of the last year for the company. and we had a significant reduction in the severity rate of these incidents. and despite having a slightly higher number of incidents, they were less severe. so we closed with a 21.3% reduction in the severity rate quarter-over-quarter. for dams and water, you know that we are working on this area and in the first half of the year, we started the work of the vigia dam's belt channel and the contracting of the work for the b4 belt channel. and this is also a milestone for the start of the characterization of these two dams. and we have a great indicator, we closed the first half of the year with a reduction of 8% in water capture specific for steel production.
so with a higher production, but without increasing the use of water, and this is a very important indicator considering that csn has reduced by 70% the water consumption for steel production in the past few years. social and diversity, we also want to double the number of women in our payroll. we've had a more than 11% increase in female participation in the company. we adhered to mover. mover is movement for racial equity, an important initiative for companies from different industries working in favor of racial equity. this should create 10,000 positions for blacks and then train thousands of people by 2030. we are advancing fast in our esg agenda with a lot of initiatives and reaping the results of all these initiatives as we can see in this slide.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
thank you, helena. and before we open for questions, i'd like to hand the conference over to our chairman and president, benjamin steinbruch, for his considerations. i think we're having connection problems. i apologize.
so i suggest that we open for questions and benjamin can join us for the final remarks. thank you all.

[operator instructions] the first question is from daniel sasson, itau. mr. daniel, you may proceed.
daniel sasson -- itau -- analyst
hello. good morning. thank you for the opportunity. my first question is perhaps to martinez about steel your steel business. can you talk about your expected margin looking forward based on the 33% this quarter. so how far can you reach considering that you still have some price carryover from the second to the third quarter? and also there's the evolution of the cost of raw materials.
and the second question maybe is for marcelo. with the low leverage levels and very strong perspectives in terms of results, there's a natural question that arises about capital allocation. do you see more opportunities after the perpetuals that you're going to rest in september, so in which business lines of the company today except of course for the projects that we already know and have already been approved in mining and cement. what are the business areas today where you see your major opportunities? and if you allow me, i'd like to ask about cement. we saw a price increase of 6% in the quarter. so can you also talk about what you expect for quarter -- so for the second half of the year, do you think that these price increases will continue in the second half of the year and will continue to help the results of this business unit? thank you.
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
hello, daniel. good morning. this is martinez. so let's start with your question about the expected margin for quarter three. i don't know if you remember, but when we started the profitability recovery plan of the company, marcelo used to say that 1.5 year ago and that was in dollar per ton of ebitda. and fortunately, with all the work that was done and with other factors that also helped supply demand and cost factor, we closed the first quarter with a margin of $400 per ton of ebitda. and the forecast for quarter three is to reach a margin of about $500 to $530 per ton. of course, we expect that in this quarter costs will behave a little better. although -- well people didn't really pay attention to this in the market. but today for example, for one ton of coal, we are already paying about $200 per ton. so if you look at what is happening regarding costs, for example, the cost of coal today which was $140, $150 now it's $210 fob australia. coke remains the same, the same price fob china and for iron ore $203 to $215. so part of this has already priced in.
and another important thing is that we should have a price carryover to quarter three between 13% and 17%. there are some reasons for that that are very peculiar to csn's work and their strategy. and what is motivating this? for example, in july, there was a change in the pricing criteria for customers that had an annual or even half yearly contract. and that doesn't exist anymore in csn. all our contracts now are quarterly. and we work with a very small number of contract today. so we changed the sales profile to work with spot 75% to 80% and this has been of great help. just to give you an idea in july, in the industry, we accumulated an increase of about 120% to 130%. so we should certainly have this price carryover which will help us our profitability quarter three. in a magnitude 13% to 17% and an ebitda of $500 to $530 per ton.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
well now as for your question about capital allocation, we have our priorities very well defined by segment. for example, in the case of steel, we are very much focused on productivity gains considering the current volumes. so these are projects under upv in particular, which will lead to improved efficiencies, centralization of our coke shops and removing bottlenecks. this will increase the production volume in about 10% to 15% and reduce the production costs. so this is what we have planned for steel. in mining, we have a very ambitious plan of tripling our production rates using the ipo funds. and in the case of cement, there's a mix of inorganic growth via sector consolidation and we have the appetite to do that if we have adequate price conditions. and also, organic projects that are exceptional projects that count with long-lasting sources with excellent technology and equipment a very privileged location. so this will reinforce our presence in the southeast. these are the growth focused actions that we have planned.
in the case of mining, we're talking about brl30 billion of capex in a period of seven to eight years. mixing equity and debt. we already announced the financing with -- of $350 million in a 12-year term. very favorable conditions. we will also be issuing an infrastructure debenture 10 to 15 years of maturation subsidies of 2,431. so the company's debt from now on will be very much based on this type of project financing long-term and low cost. and the liability management will follow the strategy of improving the conditions of the current liabilities. we are retiring the perpetual which has a high cost of 7%. just for comparison purposes, we have our 10-year bond negotiating at 4.2%. so we will possibly be prolonging further our debt, but always seeking to reduce the average cost trying to reach the investment levels of our credit ratings.
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
[foreign speech] this is -- daniel -- martinez. your question about cement. just to give you an overview of what we are going through right now. the brazilian market is growing at about 15.8%. of course, this is very much impacted by last quarter, which was very bad. but the expected -- and csn is growing at 16.2%, considering that in the southeast the market has grown 12%. so we're gaining share in the market that we chose. another important point is that, the market will probably close the year with a growth rate of about 6% to 8%, which is what we always talk about -- what we talk about when we prepared for the ipo.
another important point is price. price in brazil is still very low. cement in brazil is cheapest in the world. so what happens today, just to give you an idea, is that coke, the coke that we use as fuel for cement production, has doubled in price. and today it accounts for maybe 30% to 40% of our cost. so the increase of price in cement is not about recovering profitability, it's about recovering your costs. so we increased by 6% quarter-over-quarter. we already see some increases. the cement has different dynamics. we have some more focal increases -- monthly increases. so the expectation is to reach a fob net price of $295 -- sorry, brl295, which should be the industry price to allow us to have a good profitability in this segment. thank you, daniel, for your questions.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer

[foreign speech] the next question is from leonardo correa of btg pactual. leonardo, you may proceed.
leonardo correa -- btg pactual -- analyst
[foreign speech] good afternoon, everyone. my first question is also about capital allocation. i'd like to further explore the avenues that you're implementing. for example, in cement your strategy is very clear. the strategy of going through m&as and you're already delivering on that strategy and you have other opportunities inside. you also have the growth in mining, which is very well defined and already being implemented. so i'd like to explore if you have been looking at new business opportunities. and maybe, you could consider a more aggressive capital allocation, or if you will keep focusing on the core services of csn, where you already have a presence and you still have room to grow. so i would like to understand what is the strategy that you have planned for capital allocation?
and also, still about capital allocation, the theme of the buyback. we saw csna3 negotiating with your consensus accounts, a paper that is very deep -- low versus historical levels of valuation. so how do you see the possibility of a buyback, potential buyback? and the second question to martinez. martinez, you already talked about the market and the price carryover. but at the same time, we realized that we are at a crossroad in brazil regarding price. of course, the scenario is still very positive. the recent increases were very strong.
but when we look at the recent news flow of distributors and some small adjustments and discounts, when we look at the pressure of the government for a potential small reduction in import rates and all the noise that we hear about this informal price agreement, which was then denied. looking at the premiums, we see that the premiums are getting fuller between 15% and 20%. so it seems that it is somehow losing momentum and customers are having some difficulty in some isolated cases. so i'd like to hear more about price in brazil and how you see this current moment and the new elements that were brought into the discussion?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
[foreign speech] now about capital allocation. we have five segments. it's not just mining and steel and cement. we also have energy and infrastructure. this gives us more broadness in terms of how we search for opportunities. we're reinforcing our staff. we're training our senior executives with very good results. we have a very interesting pipeline but within these segments that i mentioned. and we don't see any possibility of diversifying beyond these five segments. what we have is an interesting discussion that has always been present in csn, which is geographical diversification.
considering the recent global crisis and national crisis that we see, it's very interesting to be present in disconnected economies for risk mitigation purposes and exposure in different markets. so csn already has a presence abroad, but that could be improved in the future. so this is certainly something that is included in benjamin's concerns. and he will address this in his final considerations.
and regarding the buyback, we do think it's a very interesting use of our cash. we already have a short-term buyback program that we have started. so in the next weeks and months, we will see part of our cash being used for that purpose. and regarding price, i think martinez is the best person to answer your question.
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
leo, one important thing, first we need to consider what is happening in the world. we already heard about this in the first call this morning. but this is all somehow permeating and being transferred to brazil, regarding the import spiller which has grown greatly. china today has the control -- has decided that they will have a strong production control in the second half of the year. we have heard from different plans that we'll be working at much lower levels. and in steel production, this is very positive, because this certainly means that prices will increase in china, compared with the current prices of about $930, $940. other data like industrial production, retail and automotive, and a reduction of the rebates that they have today for export products.
so this is what's happening in china. in russia, for example, which is a country that we didn't use to mention a lot, but on august 1st, they're going to have the implementation of temporary tariffs for imports of iron and non-iron products. so this will certainly impact us. and another important subject, which is, very interesting and important for brazil is that we're going back to apparent consumption levels of 2013. in 2013, we had brl14.5 million then we reached that value of brl11 million or brl10 million. and now in 2021, from what we see we should close the year at brl14.5 million or brl15 million. and why do i think this price can be sustained overtime?
one important thing is that today in brazil because of supply and demand, and also because of the service level that we have been providing which improved greatly particularly in csn. i think we are allowed to maintain higher premiums. premiums of about 15% are not a sin today, vis-a-vis the instability of the market, the fluctuation of the dollar exchange rate and the market. supply and demand as i said, we have a good relationship today. and another important point that i just mentioned is that, costs. although, we think they are totally controlled they are not controlled. coke has skyrocketed to $210. iron ore is still at very high levels. the prices are around the world. and we are not different from the rest of the world. they are more appreciated than in brazil. today, in brazil, we have price effect of maybe a bq of about $1,400 or $1,220, similar to europe. in the u.s. they're higher. and with this current global situation the peak of imports has gone by already. of course there will be a carryover for the next few months.
the exchange rate variable is exogenous so we don't -- will not have full control, but we believe in the level of 5.10, 5.20 which is still healthy for us. so these are basically the items that are supporting, our strategy. and we can even think of a price increase in the future, depending on the cost and depending on the premium or the dollar exchange rate. regarding import tariffs, i think this makes no sense. and it would actually be counterproductive, because we don't want to compete. all the steel industries in the world from their door in are very competitive. but what motivated the discussion about the import tariffs was supply.
so what causes the import cost is the low stock. and this doesn't happen anymore. we have full supply currently. and regarding competition, we're already preparing for the drop in these tariffs. and it's interesting to see this happening in brazil because this means that the other reforms will be happening in parallel. so having this competitive strategy and the other reforms taking place, i don't see why we should reduce the rates. and regarding the import tariffs, this was very polarized in a few sectors. today markets are well replenished. and when we talk about imports we see a lot of imports coming in. we have 900,000 tons imported this year.
it was equivalent to the whole of last year. so competitiveness is full in this industry. i don't think that will be a relevant threat. i don't even think that will be a priority for the government. the highest priority for the government based on our conversations was supply. and we don't have a supply problem now. we have full supply in all product lines.
operator
the next question is from caio ribeiro, credit suisse. caio, please you may proceed.
caio ribeiro -- credit suisse. caio -- analyst
my first question is about your dividend payout policy. today your policy is 25% of your net income. but with this low leverage and the potential tax reform with the taxation -- potential taxation of dividends. is there any chance you'll be announcing extraordinary dividends this year or even expanding your policy to a higher payout linked to cash generation maybe?
and also my second question is about steel. could you talk more about how you see the evolution of the delivery terms of your products? how this has evolved in the last few months? and how these terms compare with the terms that you had in the first and second quarter of last year? also how are you seeing the steel inventory levels and the sales mix in the internal and external markets, i know you're focusing on the domestic market, but do you see any changes planned for that?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
thank you for question. regarding the dividends, of course, we're very attentive to the repercussions of eventual reforms any reforms that may happen and this will guide our strategy and behavior. but regarding the csn group based on the reform that we had, we don't see any intra-group losses of course from the standpoint of the shareholders the possibility of taxes on dividends would decrease efficiency. so this could be a trigger for new decisions taken this year. but looking from a structural standpoint this new phase of liquidity and capital allocation is very recent. so we have our radar very attentive to any potential opportunities and these opportunities are coming up because this is a time of desynchronized recoveries. we have some industries doing really well and others not so much so this is the time of opportunities.
but it's a little premature to talk about increasing dividends when we can have new opportunities arising. and we have a clear limitator which is reaching the level of investment from the standpoint of our credit rating and also the low leverage. and this will be our priority before increasing dividend payout. but shareholders do have a different level of distribution. last year, we distributed brl900 million. and now only in the first half of the year we have distributed twice as much. so the dividends will come with the improved results. and of course we will study the impact of this recent reform. but for now csn's and csn mining policies will be maintained.
caio ribeiro -- credit suisse. caio -- analyst
hi. this is caio. and as we heard from benjamin, quarter three is a given right? you talked about delivery terms.
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
and delivery terms of products are fully under control. there may be some very short delays, but also anticipation which compensates for the delays. another important point is that we have pipeline of orders of about 900 tons. so you'll have a full quarter three. and with the price carryover of 13% to 17% you can expect that our results in quarter three will be even better than in quarter two. and that's for everything. and regarding inventory levels this is also an important question. distribution which used to be a sector where we heard a lot about how we had to have three or 3.5 months of inventory. the inventory went from 2.3 to 2.6. so we didn't have that much of a recovery. and of course the -- the other businesses in the sector they are more conservative now in terms of increasing their stocks.
we see a lot of anxiety and fragility around the world toward changes. so they are planning to keep the stocks at 2.6. there's even a possibility of distribution recovering some of its stocks because they have never made so much money in the history of steelmaking in brazil and in the world. and the upstream -- then the downstream chains will have a healthy recovery that will allow customers not to lose sales. for example, in auto industry -- in the auto industry we thought they were going to go back to 35 days to 40 days of stock in the -- in their plans, but it's not that high. so despite the growth mentioned by flavio the stocks are not increasing and this is very positive.
now regarding the mix being cautious is never too much, right? so what we are doing is the export quota to the us at the full price level that we have today, we'll close the year at 250,000 tons to 300,000 tons of products to the us with a better margin than we have in brazil. the second point is bq supply, which is relatively well supplied in brazil. we are trying to empty our stocks and sending our full supply to portugal. portugal consumes 400,000 450,000 tons per year. and from now on we will send them whatever they need. and we're also accelerating the exports of metallic sheet. so we will have an outlet or a way out for some accommodation based on the level of full supply that we currently have in the market. so we're very confident about quarter three because we have volumes already sold. we have prices realized and we will wait for our ebitda results, which will certainly be the magnitude of $500 to $530 per ton.
caio ribeiro -- credit suisse. caio -- analyst

the next question in english is from carlos de alba, morgan stanley. mr. carlos, you may proceed.
carlos de alba -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. so a couple of questions. first one is obviously extraordinary results expected for the third quarter in terms of ebitda per ton in the steel business. but looking here at my historical numbers going back to 2003, the highest annual ebitda per ton was in 2008 was $151. this is a cyclical industry.
so how do you see the sustainability of the current or the expected third quarter ebitda per ton margin? and what do you expect would be a more recurring sustainable long-term margin? and then if i may ask on capital allocation. now that the ip of the cement business is postponed or canceled would the company still pursue an acquisition on that sector and maybe finance it differently with debt and cash on hand?
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
hi, carlos. well, from the standpoint of sustainability. well i was happy to go through that situation in 2003, 2004. i was already here. so i understand what are the major differences. the world is very different. the first point is that in operational excellence, so from the standpoint of productivity, csn is launching now it's at full speed. it has all its maintenances regularly anticipated, some of the maintenances in quarter-in quarter two to prepare ourselves for quarter three and four. of course, we are being a little more careful with coal. because the price has increased a lot and this certainly has an impact on our costs and ore prices are also at a high level and that will sustain the price level.
regarding supply and demand, what i said, we have a good situation and looking at all the possible scenarios in brazil and all the markets, the agribusiness market, the railway market or roads, civil construction. all the markets are now at a very privileged situation in brazil. imports differently from what people think. i think that it has a decreasing trend in imports because of the rebalancing of the steel chains in the world considering europe and the us. so we truly believe that this margin of $500 to $520 per ton of steel going beyond quarter three will be sustainable even for quarter four. and of course the next year we still don't know. but there's nothing pointing to a bad scenario in the next six months at least. that's what we think in terms of sustainability of our steel business as a whole.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
and carlos, just to add to what he said is that the vision of stronger for longer. we think that from the standpoint of global demand, there's no half turn in the stimuli for future consumption. so at least for the next two or three years and this will even be a lesson learned after the crisis that we had in 2008, 2009. developed countries and developing countries will take good care of their societies and the way they were affected by the pandemic. so demand will keep being really strong and supply has been disappointing from the standpoint of volumes and also structurally as we can see from the activities of the chinese government. so structurally, we will see margins above the historical margin of 150 margins or at least double that amount in the next three years.
and regarding cement, thank you for asking about cement. the ipo was not canceled, not at all. we are still updating our numbers for quarter two. we had excellent record-breaking numbers. so we're very excited with the mid and long-term of this business, not the short-term but med and long-term. so yes, we are looking for opportunities to finance this growth. that's what we're seeing in mining. we committed to the ipo and we moved on. we actually made it. but we think, there's additional time to update with the numbers of quarter two will be very useful, so that we can keep training and educating the investors that don't know much about this segment at least not for now.
so we will continue with our ipo plans. and we will continue with our strategy of m&a and consolidation in the sector. of course, the timing of one may not be the same as the other. but these things will be taking place even without the ipo and always conditioned to our capital structure. we will always respect our capital structure. we will not make any moves that will increase our net debt to more than brl15 billion or deleverage to more than one time. but today we don't see any acquisitions that could bring us to above these levels that we establish. we are looking for the right m&as.
carlos de alba -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thank you very much, marcelo and martinez

good morning, everyone. i have two questions. martinez, going back to the issue of price and focusing on car mix and the automotive industry. will you revise the frequency of your contracts with car companies? you talked about that but i'd like to understand more, what is the current situation? is there any chance of having quarterly contracts with car industry -- with the car industry as well? and what about the rest of the industry other industrial customers that you may have.
and the second question is about cement. martinez, what is the risk that you see for quarter -- for the second half of the year? and even for 2022 of seeing some deceleration in retail demand with all the reforms. and any changes in the current pace in the current rhythm? so what will be the equation for cement demand in brazil in the second half of the year in 2022?
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
hello, thiago. good morning. as for your first question just to try to explain very clear terms what we're doing here in csn. well first, there was always this desire on the part of csn to eliminate the gap that exists between distribution and civil construction products and contract products, contract-based products even for white line appliances or car mix. and this is not a problem that was led by csn. it was actually the culture. there was a lot of deviation, that was causing great distortions in the market as a whole. so what's happening today is that, of course, this price situation, the cost situation that we have in the market allowed us to do something more coherent in terms of our business policies. as i said in the beginning of this call we defined a new sales policy in csn.
and these contracts i don't even think this is good for the customer or for csn those annual contracts. what we need is, to close a certain volume and deliver this volume and discuss this on a half yearly basis at the longest and i'd rather do it quarterly with very few customers that we have today based on this model. for example, today in our product breakdown and market production breakdown, we have 34 in distribution, plus 16 in civil construction so 50; 17 in general industry with spot price 67 and 10 more in packaging. we're the only producer in brazil, so 77. so we have practically 75% to 80% of our customers in spot price. the other 20% -- the other 20% will be working with very short-term contracts and much more corrected because we don't want to have distortions in the value chain. so there's no chance and this is csn's policy. i don't really care about what the market is doing. the market is doing a lot of things that are wrong. so we will work with the things that we think are right to maximize profitability to our shareholders. so this is our commercial policy and we will not be making any changes.
now regarding cement, to be honest thiago, we only see good things for cement. we are not expecting to have problems in the market. and we discussed this, when we were preparing for the ipo. the accumulated growth of the market is 16%. the forecast for the year considering the second half of the year compared to last year is 6% to 8%, very promising. and the self construction -- the construction stores are still open. the number of new projects has increased, last month the number of foundations, which is also in the backlog has increased. and traditionally, the second half of the year is always stronger. so i don't see any problems. we don't foresee any problems for the cement sector. the only point is the difficulty that the sector is having. and maybe the sector should be a little bit more eager or stronger to be able to recover its profitability, because the prices that we have here in brazil are very low compared with the rest of the world. and with the increase in costs that we are seeing for example for coke, the prices will increase. there is no other way. that accounts for 30% to 40% of the price and it has doubled in price. so from the standpoint of the market, i don't have any worries. we will continue to see a very positive outlook.
and we are -- we also work with long products and everything that uses cement has to do with long products. the interest rates are relatively low. we have good liquidity in the market. and we have the willingness and the trust of the business community. we have to consider facts and data and that's what we will use as a base to guarantee our second half of the year. and the second point, which i want to highlight today and edvaldo may even add if he wants. but the acquisition of elizabeth, what it will bring us is a very strong entry in a market that was practically unknown by csn and is very strategic. and it will also allow us to have better integration of the markets, the customers and etc.. i don't know if edvaldo wants to add anything about the acquisition of elizabeth, which i think is a very important milestone for csn this year.
edvaldo rabelo -- director
thank you. well, it's important to mention that elizabeth represents to us a fast entry in the northeast market and a growth of 30% in our production capacity. it's a very competitive plant. we certainly have a lot of expectations in terms of synergies and upsides with elizabeth. and the summary of these upsides and opportunities is that we are going to replicate what we have done in the past 10 years in the company in our commercial strategy of selling little too many. and in manufacturing our focus on results and cost optimization. that's what we expect in a very important market, which is the northeast of brazil.
thiago lofiego -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
very clear. thank you very much for your answers.
luis fernando barbosa martinez -- executive director
thank you.

the next question in english is from alexandra cinonij [phonetic]. alexandra you may proceed.
alexandra cinonij -- [phonetic] -- analyst
hi. thank you for the opportunity to ask question. so there was this article in bloomberg saying that this finance minister said that brazil has a deal with steel companies not to raise prices in 2021. i already see high -- yeah i already see higher realized prices in your reports and you also just said in your report, you might consider higher prices in the future. so, again, can you please help me understand what the segment was and how we can refer to what you said before?
and also next question that i have is that in the morning you announced the rider of first [phonetic] will be financed 100% from cars? and can you please remind me your leverage target? has it changed? i think last time that last quarter it was four to five times net debt to ebitda? thank you.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
well, regarding the price control that the government is supposedly implementing, i once again must tell you that, first, brazil today has a full steel supply condition. we don't have any customer or any productive change today either for flats or longs that is not fully replenished. we don't have that today. we have full supply. another important point is that the steel plants in brazil and csn particularly due to the integration of our assets is very competitive as i said from its doors in. i don't have any control or actually we are paying for the lack of control of the brazil cost. so i can say for sure we're not looking for protection. we're looking for a competitive isonomy regarding other products.
and the third important point is that brazil is totally open for imports. as i said in the first half of the year, the import of flats was equivalent to the imports of the entire year last year. so there's no possibility of stock-outs of steel. so the trend is that the government if they choose to do something, they'll do the 10% of 12, which is 1.2. i think that is also very unlikely. and i -- well, that could even take place if the administrative and tax reforms would be effectively implemented simultaneously. and i don't see that as a threat in terms of price control for brazil. now regarding the buyback, we will be doing that with our own cash. we will not need new emissions to buy back the $1 million of the perpetual. that doesn't mean that, over time we will not find good opportunities in the market. but, looking at this horizon for the buyback of the perpetual, we will be using our own cash.
alexandra cinonij -- [phonetic] -- analyst
okay. so, your leverage targets, can you remind me what the leverage target, what it is now in terms of net debt-to-ebitda?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
the target -- well, it's actually more of a ceiling. it's one time the net debt/ebitda ratio. right now, we are at 1.6 times. but, by the end of the year, we will be below one.
alexandra cinonij -- [phonetic] -- analyst
thanks so much.

thank you, ladies and gentlemen. since we have no further questions, i hand it back over to mr. marcelo cunha ribeiro, executive director of investor relations for his final remarks.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
so, now let's hand it over to benjamin for his remarks, but this is just an attempt, because we still have some connection problems. benjamin. can you hear us?
benjamin steinbruch -- chairman and chief executive officer
can you hear me, marcelo?
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
yes, we hear you. we hear you. go ahead.
benjamin steinbruch -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i apologize for the technical problems. good afternoon, everyone. thank you for attending this conference call. i would just like to tell you that we are very happy to having been able to deliver these very good results. it was actually as if we had completed 12 months in six. so, by midyear, we have reached what we had proposed for the full year. so very briefly, i will go over the next priorities that we will have from now on. just to bring everybody to the same level. the first intensive priority will be the investment grade until the end of the year. we will be doing whatever we can to be considered an investment grade company. we will maintain our leverage level close to zero or below 1. don't be surprised, if we have zero debt by the end of the year. our greatest priority is to have this zero leverage.
investments will be made with long-term financing compensated by our cash. we will maintain high cash levels. i heard a lot of questions about with the fact that we are a cyclical industry having highs and lows, so how we would fight that. we're going to do that through a low debt level and a high cash level. so, investments will be based on the strategy, both organic investments and also any potential m&a opportunities. they will be listed on the stock exchange their respective currency, so that we can tap the opportunities without the need to increase our debt level. we will be very conservative in everything that we do and we will preserve as much as we can this investment grade that we are seeking to achieve by the end of the year. we are always striving for quality, increasingly striving for quality. that's our main premise. so both for ore and cement and also steel we will also be looking for added value improved quality always based on the highest price. and our great project for the second half of the year is to control and lower our costs.
we did everything possible and impossible to update our prices based on the cost increase and we will now be strongly working to reduce these costs so that -- we can assure the best competitiveness possible. so i'm very confident. i'm expecting an exceptional second half of the year. quarter three as we heard is a given. and in quarter four, unless we have any unexpected disaster there's nothing that will change this good trajectory that we are seeing this year with increasing results. we're very optimistic about our company about the market. and we're very proud of our team. we're proud of our company of the targets that we were able to reach as we said six months -- 12 months in six months. and many wouldn't have believed that if we had told the story in the beginning of the year.
today we have a company that is totally different from what it was in the past. what we still have is good assets. and based on that we will be working on a totally opposite way. we have to manage excesses now and not deficiencies. and this is something that we will be doing surgically with maximum dedication always looking at our investment grade, always looking at our 0 debt target, always looking at our high liquidity targets and low debt targets. so these are the premises that will guide us moving forward. thank you very much for attending. congratulations to everyone in our company who worked really hard much more than you can imagine. our analysts and everyone we are very proud of the results that you helped us achieve and thank you all for your hard work.
this was exceptional work and i would like to congratulate each and every one of you, our employees and everyone involved because this certainly required a lot of dedication, hard work and energy and the results are very good. we are very proud of communicating these results to the market, the results that we had in the first half of the year. and that we are expecting for the rest of the year as well. thank you all for attending this conference call. we are always at your service. should you have any further questions and a big hug to all of you. thank you, marcelo.
marcelo cunha ribeiro -- executive officer
thank you, benjamin. i think everything was very clear. i'd like to thank all the investors and analysts who attended this call and we are at your service should you have any further questions. thank you very much.
