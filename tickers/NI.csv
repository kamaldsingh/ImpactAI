[operator instructions] our first question comes from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. your line is now open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning to you.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, julien.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, howdy. so perhaps, just to kick things off, just on the capital front. i know you guys have been talking a good bit about gas safety over the year, prospectively continue to talk about it. we'd be curious how you think about this capex of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion relative to that kind of longer-term trend through '22.
how do you think the cadence is? how do you think even that guidance through the '22 period meshes with the potential further spend or effort on gas safety holistically?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, julien, and good morning. we look at that, our long-term guidance on capital, the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that we've got there. there's a lot of focus on the gas side. we certainly haven't seen significant changes on the investments because of the sms approach.
we're still early in that process. and i think it won't necessarily change that guidance level but will change the components of the investments we make in each state there. when you look at the increase to $2 billion over the next couple of years, we've got a couple of significant projects. one in ohio that's really a looping project in central ohio where we've had some significant growth, which runs through a tracker program.
so that's the real increase that you'll see over the next couple of years in our guidance.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and then perhaps if i can ask you, with respect to the incremental equity financing in 2020, how do you think about perhaps some of the puts and takes against reaffirming the longer-term 5% to 7% eps cagr? i understand there's a range for reason. i understand that this is a discrete item against the longer-term outlook. but i would be curious if you perceive other items here whether in '20 or onwards that might otherwise mitigate the dilutive impact of the incremental equity here.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes. when we look at the long term, certainly the plan for next year but also as we build out the long-term plan that our infrastructure investments and as you see on one of the charts in there, there's a significant portion of our investments that are going into trackers. and so we're getting pretty quick returns back on those investments and that really does support the $500 million to $700 million of equity that we've outlined for next year. so we're confident in our ability to meet those commitments and think that we've got certainly levers on the infrastructure program, but our overall operating plan with continued investment in safety and the gas business.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. i'll leave it there. thank you, guys.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, julien.

our next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. your line is now open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
good morning. can you just real quick -- sticking with massachusetts, can you just touch on sort of the second gas leak we saw with the restoration project? is there sort of any status or updates? i think the formal investigations have started. and is -- the moratorium that's on nonemergency work, do you see any long-term impact in that?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks, shar. that's an important topic to update on. so as we have noted, that gas leak did not result in any damage to property or any significant consequences, but it has indeed struck some erosion of confidence and trust and concerns in the community and across the state. so the moratorium as it relates to that is we agree with and we are aligned with the dpu, a part of our comprehensive efforts to restore confidence and restore trust.
that leak, as you know, relating to work that was done last year on the rebuild. so we've taken a hard look at the rebuild itself and we are continuing to verify the service lines that were abandoned throughout that, not in any way related to the leak in september. but our efforts there are comprehensive and focused on restoring trust and confidence. the moratorium itself does two things.
it helps to marshal resources for the service line investigations but also gives us an opportunity to work with the dpu to build assurance of safe operations across the state. we're confident and optimistic that as we work through the remaining phases of the service line abandonment verification and begin to work with the dpu on the audit that we expect to be implemented, that we will be on a path to rebuild that trust and confidence and that the moratorium would ultimately be lifted. we don't have a date for that right now but that's certainly our goal. in terms of long-term impact, we are factoring in some impacts into our 2020 guidance but on a fairly moderate basis.
we expect the suspension of our modernization work, the gsep work, to have an impact in 2020. that's inside the guidance. it's a relatively modest impact on cma and offset to a degree with capital allocation in other states. so it's something we're navigating through and adjusting to as we go through these steps with the dpu.
yes, that's exactly it.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
and then just around the rate case. can we just get a sense on timing? are you still assuming first quarter? it doesn't seem like sort of this moratorium or -- is going to impact the timing. so i guess, are you still expecting to file a grc in the first quarter?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
no. we haven't set a date for filing. i think what we've said consistently is we'd look at that early next year, we'd start to take a look at that. we have a number of steps we need to work through, including the investigations with the dpu.
they announced as we noted on the call earlier two investigations: one into the incident last year, and the other into the response to the incident. and so working through those will be an important part of the overall process with the dpu as we contemplate future rate case activity.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly on a follow-up on the sms question from the prior caller. you guys are -- it's preliminary. you're very early in the process.
do you have a sense maybe on the cost of o&m and how that profile can shape as we look to model that on a go-forward basis as you get further into the sms program?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, we've certainly seen some higher cost this year and part of that is really the start-up as we look at our process and procedures and roll that out across seven states. i'd say going forward, we'll see -- it's a lower increases in the gas segment. we're certainly -- expect that the gas segment will grow 1% to 2% over the next year or so.
but the real change comes in our process and procedures and the rigor that we apply to those practices versus increased costs that would drive our overall o&m for the gas segment.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. ok. i will pass this. thanks, guys.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, shar.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from insoo kim with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. in regards to the equity issuance, any thoughts or comment you can give on potential timing of that as we head into 2020? are you potentially thinking about maybe doing a forwards in the fourth quarter this year for 2020? and then related to that, what weighted average share count should we assume when you're providing the 2020 eps guidance?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
so we've got some flexibility on the timing of that equity. we need it by the end of next year to make sure that we hit our rating agency credit targets. so we haven't determined or decided the timing or how we'll do that, including looking at forwards. but we are -- as you would expect, those are all the things that we're looking at and trying to determine what makes the most sense.
but we've got some flexibility and certainly don't need it until the end of next year to meet our targets. randy, you have the --
randy hulen -- vice president of investor relations
yes, i think as far as the weighted average share count for this year, it's largely going to be about where the share count is today because we've done most of the activities under a forward that that closes in december of this year that won't really add to the share count on a weighted-average basis.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so just to clarify that the $500 million to $700 million that you're assuming at some point in 2020, that's not necessarily embedded in the share count when you're giving the $1.36 to $1.40?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
it will be embedded for next year's guidance, absolutely.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so that's part of that. and i guess, if i'm assuming the midpoint then if i'm spreading that across the year, that would probably be relatively a safe assumption of how you're getting to the midpoint?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
you can certainly take that approach.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. just away from that, in indiana with the 300 megawatt indiana crossroads wind farm. i assume that was part of the last round of rfps and kind of separate from the october filing that you guys just made, where you're filing for a lot more solar, wind and/or storage. was that the jv in the partial ownership of indiana crossroads part of your growth, base growth plan into 2021? and then when it comes to the current round of rfps, does that satisfy the -- would that satisfy the capacity that -- and the energy necessary for the 2023 time frame for the coal reductions?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
let me take the last piece first. it's part of the overall solution for the 2023 capacity replacement. the crossroads filing that we just made mirrors the model that we pioneered earlier with the rosewater project. the rosewater was 100 megawatts.
indiana crossroads is 300 megawatts. as you know, rosewater approved by the iurc, pending at ferc, and we do have private letter ruling support from the irs. so we think we have got a good model in place to follow with the crossroads project and it is consistent to your first question with the rfp from last year. it follows from that, it's not related to the new rfp.
most of this is beyond the current capex guidance. so most of what we're talking about with these projects falls beyond 2022. so our new rfp that's out now, we would expect to have into our forecast and planning early next year, which should put us in a position sometime next year to extend the guidance beyond 2022. and at that time, we'll be in a much better position to lay out how these projects and any that come out of the current rfp set up for capex beyond 2022 and our overall gross guidance beyond 2022.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from steve fleishman with wolfe research. your line is now open.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. hi. thank you. just wanted to clarify, the additional equity in the 2020 guidance that -- you're not just assuming it goes in at the end of the year 2020 that it's kind of average through the year or something like that?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
let me clarify. we have not determined the timing of that equity. but what i would say is we don't need it until the end of the year. so it certainly gives us some flexibility to do it during the year or at the end of the year.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and in the guidance range, maybe to ask a different way, in the guidance range for 2020, it's not going to really move it much if you do it earlier than right at year-end? is that fair?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's fair.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then just in terms of the decision. because back a few months ago, you've been reviewing things like preferreds and hybrids and could you maybe just give a little more clarity on why you decided to do -- this is all equity, just to be overly conservative? or how did you come to that conclusion?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
just looking at our current stock price, our expectations of what that cost of equity is and issuance costs versus what we're seeing for preferred, both the preferred equity and the subordinated debt. and since you don't get the 100% credit from the agencies for those subordinated notes, the overall cost to us appears to been lower to issue the equity.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then on the property insurance decision, is there any way to gauge when you might get a decision from the insurers on that?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
it's still early. so we filed in july with the property insurer. the ntsb report came out in late september. and so we really just started at the process with the insurer that now they have access to the pipe and the report that they can do their due diligence on the claim.
and so at this point, we don't have any recovery in our plan but certainly going to go through the process to seek to recover all that we filed for.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
do you have recovery though in massachusetts in your plan?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
recovery? what do you mean? in terms of. . .
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
like some kind of a rate recovery for that, if not property recover, rate recovery? or are you just assuming no recovery?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
so from an insurance standpoint, we would wait for the insurance process to fully finish before requesting any type of recovery on the investments we made last year and early this year in merrimack valley. so that timing will matter there on how we seek to recover that through customers.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from christopher turnure with jp morgan. your line is now open.
christopher turnure -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning, jow and don. most of my questions have been answered but i wanted to just go back to 2020 drivers. i think you mentioned that o&m would only go up by 1% or 2% in the gas segment. but are there any other kind of major drivers there besides what you've already talked about with potential massachusetts rate release, interest expense reduction or cost cuts elsewhere? can you guys hear me?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i'm sorry. i was muted. so yes, i do expect that the gas will be up slightly year over year from an o&m standpoint. but between the corporate segment and the electric segment that will offset, an overall o&m should be about flat.
christopher turnure -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then any other kind of major rate relief or other drivers that we might be missing there?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
well, we're going through that planning now to determine which rate cases, if any, we would file for next year. as you expect, we're typically in a couple every year across our seven states, but we haven't publicly announced if and when we would file the next rate cases.
christopher turnure -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's all i have. thanks, guys.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks, chris.

our next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse. your line is now open.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, guys.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning, michael.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning. on the 5% to 7% growth rate going forward, at this point with the extra equity that's out there, are we -- are you expecting to -- that that's going to be the permanent trajectory of $1.30 from 2019 based on that going forward? in other words, there won't be any catch up to the original pre-lawrence guidance going forward as a result of the additional equity. would that be fair to say?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd really say it's 5% to 7% of off this year's 2019 guidance.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
right, right. so it doesn't -- there's no acceleration coming out of -- from pension asset recovery or faster than expected insurance recoveries or any of that going forward?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
no, not that we're guiding to at this point.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. all right. that's all i have.
thank you.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you.

our next question comes from greg gordon with evercore isi. your line is now open.

our next question comes from andrew levi with exoduspoint. your line is now open.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
hey, guys, how are you?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning, andy.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
hey, just a few questions. just on mass. what percent of your total earnings come from mass?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
it's about 8% to 9%.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
8% to 9%, ok. and your capex is about $100 million to -- $80 million to $140 million out of your $1.7 billion capex budget?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
it's in that range.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
ok. so it's really a small piece of your total business, and obviously, you've taken quite a ding there as far you're -- what you had to put out. but as you stated, that seems to be kind of done now. so it seems there's a -- do you guys feel there's an overemphasis on the financial impact going forward, not what it was on this part of your -- this segment of your total business, which, i guess, the rest is 75% tracked? your earnings are fairly predictable.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
no, i think it is a very good point financially, andy. it is a smaller portion of our business from an earnings standpoint, and so it does have less of an impact going forward. but i also understand the concerns and questions that investors and other stakeholders have on that business and how that impacts overall nisource. but yes, it is a smaller portion of our earnings and our capital going forward and that does allow us, because we're in six other states, to have some flexibility to meet our earnings and growth commitment.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
and as far as the timing of the equity issuance which is, again, not that big of an issuance, is that going to happen this year? or will it not be issued until next year?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
no, we will not do it this year. certainly with the insurance recoveries coming in faster than expected, we're confident that we'll meet our credit targets for 2019, and so it's definitely a 2020 issuance.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then the last thing is for joe. if you kind of look at where the stock is trading, whether it's on '20 guidance or '21 or '22 consensus earnings or whether they are a $0.01 higher or lower, whatever.
they're fairly ballpark, i think. the stock trades from anywhere between an 8% to 50% discount to the regulated electric group. could you kind of just address that and what your thoughts are that they're relative to where you've traded in the past and how, as the ceo, you plan to fix that?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks, andy. i think that some of that goes to your earlier question. the core value of the business is intact, resilient. we laid out a lot of the investment and regulatory profile even on this call for this year and looking ahead to next year with our guidance.
so if you kind of follow the long trajectory here and add to that, the work we're doing with our risk analytics and sms, we see the same, if not an enhanced pipeline of the infrastructure investment activities through the foreseeable future, then supplement that with the work we're doing to position generation investments in our generation portfolio, repositioning work. i'd say we're in a strong, if not a stronger position than we were a year ago, set aside massachusetts and the impact of the greater lawrence incident, which as we've talked about today, much of the cost of that is now well defined and well accounted for in our plan. so i think it really becomes that core execution strategy and that core execution story that we've always had with a much enhanced level of rigor and risk analytics driving that as we go forward.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
ok. and then just a clarification on the equity timing. so even if -- you're not going to even do a forward this year, right? it won't be issued until sometime next year. is that correct? or you're just saying as far as when you will actually reflect it?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
exactly. i think we've got some flexibility to do a forward this year. we haven't determined if we will or not but certainly have flexibility to push equity needs to the end of next year if that's what makes the most sense.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from charles fishman with morningstar research. your line is now open.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
thank you, donald. can i impose on you to repeat a comment you made? i don't think i understood it. you were talking about the sizing of the block equity issuance next year, $500 million or $700 million. and i thought you said, i suspect i got this wrong, the logic of it was, directed toward merrimack valley, $1.4 billion of cost.
you're assuming $800 million of recovery of insurance, which left $600 million. that's what was driving the sizing of the block equity issuance, did i get that right?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's exactly right. yes, we need to finance that difference long term, and to meet our credit rating targets, we need to issue equity for that difference.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
ok. and obviously, there's a lot of other costs associated with sms and other things you're doing outside of massachusetts that was maybe in part driven by the events in merrimack valley, correct?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i'd say it was accelerated. that's the mass work where we really started about nine months before merrimack valley event in september. but we certainly accelerated that activity post the event to make sure that we started to implement those processes and procedures across all seven states.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
ok. and then the $100 million increase in capex this year, was that sms, just general gas, general -- electric work or all of the above?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i'd say it's not sms. i'd say the big change that we had in this past year was the low-pressure system work that we started in 2019 to install the devices across all seven states.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
this was just an acceleration of that.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right. so that's a big portion of the change, but i'd say it's kind of across the seven states, including electric. that $100 million increase.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
ok. last question. slide 11, i think it's consistent with the slides in the past where you show what the -- recovery timing of your capex. there's a big drop down between '19, '20 and then going forward as far as the percentage that you have to go for a -- just a general rate case.
was that driven by ohio? or what drove that drop, that ledge right there?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
going forward into 2020 and '21, it really is ohio with the cep tracker that we have now that most of the capital or all of the capital expense in ohio is going through the tracker program as well as just increases in indiana and some other states.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
and then you said that -- i assume then it was this change in ohio that really drove this big transmission project there that you got coming up?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right. that's right. i think -- to think about as you look at the difference between '18, '19 and going forward is the investment we made in greater lawrence. until the $255 million to $260 million is reflected in those two numbers and so you've got that switch of significant rate case investment that we wouldn't have going forward.
charles fishman -- morningstar research -- analyst
ok. that's all i have. thank you very much.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the nisource third-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. randy hulen, vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
please go ahead, sir.
randy hulen -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, skyler, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nisource third-quarter 2019 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, chief executive officer; and donald brown, chief financial officer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2019 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions.
slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. before turning the floor over to joe and donald, just a quick reminder. some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this recording relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measures and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. with all that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe. 
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks, randy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our nisource teams continue their relentless focus on our core commitments of safety and customer satisfaction and our long-term utility modernization programs that enhance safety and reliability while driving our financial results. we've also made significant progress on our electric generation strategy in indiana with the approval of the rosewater wind project and the filing of a second joint venture wind project, indiana crossroads.
our execution through the third quarter has positioned nisource to meet our financial commitments for 2019, and today, we're initiating guidance for 2020. there's much to cover so let's turn to slide 3, which summarizes our key accomplishments through the third quarter and early fourth quarter. consistent with our long-term growth commitments, we expect to deliver non-gaap net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. as we've stated before, we expect to grow our non-gaap earnings per share and dividend by 5% to 7% annually and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $2 billion each year through 2022.
our third-quarter 2019 non-gaap net operating earnings were $0.00 per share versus $0.10 in 2018. donald will address the drivers for the quarter in a few minutes, but i will emphasize that nisource remains well-positioned to deliver net operating earnings per share within our $1.27 to $1.33 guidance range for 2019. we expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2019, slightly above our initial forecast for the year. we're making solid progress on our foundational commitment to safety, including accelerated implementation of a safety management system, or sms.
our sms is aligned with the framework developed for pipeline operators by the american petroleum institute. sms is a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement in identifying and mitigating potential operational risks proactively. as part of our sms work, enhanced risk management processes have been introduced at each of our gas distribution companies. our sms team has completed its first set of risk asset analysis, which will help inform our maintenance priorities and investment decisions.
the team has also introduced a corrective action program, or cap, which offers a simple way for our employees and contractors to report safety concerns and provides a systematic process to review, prioritize, address and track progress to reduce risk. this program is available across our gas business in support and corporate functions. in addition to sms implementation, safety enhancements to our low-pressure gas distribution systems remain a priority. teams have installed more than 1,000 automatic shut off devices across the nisource footprint this year, including completing all installation of these devices in massachusetts and virginia.
these automatic shutoff devices operate like circuit breakers to provide an additional level of control and protection. when the device senses an operating pressure that is too high or too low, it is designed to immediately shut down natural gas to the system regardless of the cause. our teams have also located and mapped all of our nearly 2,100 low-pressure regulator station control or sensing lines. we use this information to add new details into our electronic mapping systems.
earlier this month, we named chuck shafer to the newly created position of chief safety officer. reporting directly to me, chuck is accountable for driving our long-term multiyear outlook and road map to reduce risk, providing an independent view and source of safety expertise and risk analysis across all nisource companies. he is leading a centralized safety function to provide structured oversight and expertise in assuring rigorous emphasis on safety. our electric-generation strategy continues to advance in indiana. we've issued our second request for proposals for replacement capacity.
the rfp is consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and all coal generation to be retired by 2028, to be replaced by lower-cost, cleaner options. the indiana utility regulatory commission has approved the joint venture agreement for our rosewater wind project, and we recently filed a cpcn application for a second joint venture wind project, indiana crossroads. the hearing in our electric base rate case concluded in august, and we expect an iurc order in the fourth quarter with new rates effective in january 2020. turning now to massachusetts. the national transportation safety board, or ntsb, last week issued a final report in its investigation of our september 2018 event in the merrimack valley.
last month, the ntsb also closed two open-urgent safety recommendations issued last year. the ntsb had made four such recommendations to nisource in november 2018 and has now deemed our responses to these urgent recommendations as acceptable. with the ntsb investigation now complete, the massachusetts department of public utilities announced its own investigations of the incident in our emergency preparedness and response. in mid-august, we completed our restoration efforts in the merrimack valley.
this restoration included the replacement of all customer equipment impacted by the event and fulfilled our commitment to have that work completed by september 15. we also repaired outdoor areas affected by our fall 2018 construction work, including residential lawns, irrigation systems, walkways, driveways and state roads throughout the impacted communities. a dedicated team remains in place providing support to impacted customers, assisting with claims processing and providing repair support on appliances and heating equipment. as announced in september, we launched a verification process, which involves inspections of gas service lines abandoned as part of the fall 2018 recovery work in greater lawrence.
these verifications, as required by the massachusetts department of public utilities, are confirming that the service lines were abandoned consistent with legal requirements and in compliance with our procedures and protocols. as we find any service line abandonments that didn't meet those requirements, we are correcting the situation immediately. we completed the initial set of 700 verifications by the required deadline of october 18. the second set of approximately 2,200 verifications is well under way and expected to be complete by november 15.
and as announced late yesterday, we are planning to verify the remaining approximately 2,000 service lines by year-end. these verifications are being done on abandoned service lines, which are not connected to an active gas system and therefore will not disrupt gas service to our customers. we know that recent events in the merrimack valley have led many to lose trust in columbia gas of massachusetts, and the customers in the affected communities are worried about whether they're safe in their own homes. we take responsibility for that loss in security.
and as part of our comprehensive efforts to rebuild confidence and trust, we brought in an experienced safety leader who knows massachusetts. earlier this month, we named nick stavropoulos as chief safety advisor at columbia gas of massachusetts, reporting directly to me. nick has led several of the country's largest gas companies, including pg&e, national grid and keyspan, and has the judgment, experience and relentless safety focus to help us through these challenging times. now i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.
donald?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe, and good morning, everyone. looking at our third-quarter results from slide 4. we had a non-gaap net operating loss of about $2 million or $0.00 per share, compared to net operating earnings of about $35 million or $0.10 per share for the same period in 2018. the biggest drivers of our third-quarter non-gaap financial performance compared to a year ago were higher net revenues due to the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investment, which were offset by increased safety-related spending and higher financing costs.
our 2019 year-to-date net operating earnings are in line with our plans, which puts us on track to achieving our 2019 guidance of $1.27 to $1.33 per share. before turning to our liquidity and financing plan, i'd like to address greater lawrence incident expenses. our total estimate, which is detailed on slide 9, has remained unchanged from our q2 earnings release. going forward, with the restoration work complete and the service line verification work nearing completion, we continue to not expect any significant future adjustments to the estimate.
however, as a reminder, this estimate excludes any amounts we may incur for potential fines and penalties. also, as we previously stated, we expect to recover a substantial portion of our greater lawrence incident costs through the $800 million of casualty insurance coverage and $300 million of property insurance in place at the time of the event. we started submitting claims in december 2018 and have collected casualty insurance recoveries of $670 million through september 30 and expect to collect the remaining $130 million for early next year. we also had filed proof of loss with our property insurer for the full cost of the $255 million to $260 million capital investment that we made in replacing the 45 miles of pipe following the event.
as the insurance recovery process moves forward, we'll continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress. now turning to slide 5. i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. following the august issuance of $750 million of 10-year notes at 2.95% interest, our total debt level as of september 30 was about $9.5 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt.
the weighted average maturity of our long-term debt was approximately 17 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. at the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.4 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program. our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. i'd now like to turn to slide 6, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investments. our current plan is approximately $500 million of long-term debt in 2020 and continued to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or atm equity issuance program, as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs.
our atm continues to be consistent with our approach to provide balanced, predictable financing for our ongoing infrastructure investments. the primary change to our financing plan is that we now expect a block equity issuance in the range of $500 million to $700 million in 2020. this change is driven by the need to permanently finance the greater lawrence event, which, excluding the capital investment, is estimated to cost approximately $1.4 billion. this total cost estimate is offset by casualty insurance recoveries that are expected to total $800 million and that leaves approximately $600 million to be financed.
we evaluated several different approaches to this incremental financing needs and determined that the best option to maintain our credit profile and to achieve our 5% to 7% annual non-gaap eps growth commitment is to pursue a common equity issuance in 2020. in our analysis, we believe common equity is less costly than hybrid security alternatives, therefore we are no longer planning to issue any hybrid securities such as preferred equity in 2019 or 2020. as joe mentioned earlier in the call, we expect to deliver non-gaap net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 in 2020, which includes the impact of this updated financing plan. this is consistent with our long-term forecast to grow our net operating earnings per share and dividends by 5% to 7% annually through 2022, and we expect to make $1.7 billion to $2 billion at annual capital investments each year from 2020 through 2022.
now i'll turn the call back to joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2019 from our gas operations on slide 7. in maryland, our base rate case request remains pending before the maryland public service commission. filed in may, the request supports continued replacement of aging pipelines and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades.
if approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $3.7 million, including $1.2 million of current infrastructure tracker revenue. a commission order is expected by the end of 2019 with rates in effect in january 2020. in ohio, the public utilities commission in august approved its first annual adjustment to our capital expenditure program rider. the cep rider, which was first approved by the puco in 2018, allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through our infrastructure modernization tracker.
the approved adjustment allows us to begin recovery of approximately $122 million in capital invested in 2018. new rates became effective in september. in indiana, our latest tracker update request in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program remains pending. the request covers $12.4 million in incremental capital investments made between july 2018 in april 2019.
an indiana utility regulatory commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 with rates effective november 2019. i would also note that we filed a notice to terminate our current program in anticipation of filing a new plan application by year-end. also in indiana, the iurc last month approved our phmsa compliance plan covering approximately $230 million of capital expected to be invested between 2019 and 2023. in kentucky, we filed our annual rider update application in our accelerated main replacement program, covering approximately $40 million in planned capital investment.
included in that filing is a request to recover capital that will be spent on our low-pressure systems safety enhancement work. now let's turn to our electric operations on slide 8. in august, the iurc approved the joint venture and ownership agreement for rosewater, one of three wind projects that nipsco announced in february 2019. the iurc in june approved power purchase agreement applications for the other two projects, jordan creek and roaming bison.
and earlier this month, nipsco filed an application with the iurc for a fourth wind project, indiana crossroads, a joint venture with edp renewables north america llc, which will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts. it is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021. as i mentioned earlier, nipsco on october 1 announced the opening of its second request for proposals to consider potential resources to meet the future electric needs of its customers. consistent with the 2018 integrated resource plan, we will consider all sources in the rfp process, which closes november 20. our goal is to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for technology and market changes.
the hearing concluded in august in our electric base rate case, which remains pending before the iurc. prior to the hearing, we filed two partial settlement agreements in the case. the april settlement addresses our revenue requirement, federal tax reform and depreciation schedules related to the early retirement of our coal-fired generation plant called for in our 2018 irp. if approved as filed, the partial settlement is earnings neutral and allows for a return on equity of 9.9%.
in may, we reached a settlement with the industrial group, which resolves many issues related to implementing a new service structure for industrial customers. an iurc order is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2019 with new rates effective in january 2020. we continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. the iurc approved tdsic program, represents approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investment expected to be made through 2022.
our latest tracker update request covering $131.1 million in incremental capital investments made from december 2018 through june 2019 remains pending before the iurc. an order is expected in the fourth-quarter 2019 with rates effective in january 2020. before revisiting our key takeaways for the quarter, i'd like to highlight a couple of milestones. in september, nisource was named to the dow jones sustainability north america index for the sixth consecutive year.
we were one of three u.s. multi-utility companies on the list, and it reflects advancements we continue to make on our sustainability strategy, which includes aggressive greenhouse gas reductions and executing against more than $30 billion of long-term infrastructure investments. customers and investors alike expect our companies to deliver energy safely, reliably and in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way. we continue to focus on delivering on all of these dimensions.
and if you haven't seen it, i encourage you to read our 2018 climate report, which we published on nisource.com in august. the report incorporates recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or tcfd, to disclose governance, strategy, risk management and metrics around climate-related risks and opportunities. we've taken an industry-leading approach to addressing climate change by developing plans that result in a project in 90% reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, including a projected 50% reduction in methane emissions from natural gas distribution mains and service lines by 2025. before we turn to the q&a portion of the call, i'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways.
consistent with our long-term growth commitment, in 2020, we expect to deliver non-gaap net operating earnings per share in the range of $1.36 to $1.40 and to make capital investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. nisource remains well-positioned to deliver net operating earnings per share within our $1.27 to $1.33 guidance range for 2019. we expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2019, slightly above our initial forecast for the year. our long-term investment-driven growth plan is intact and resilient.
inclusive of the adjustments made to our financing plans, we continue to expect to grow both net operating earnings per share and our dividend by 5% to 7% annually through 2022. and we expect to maintain our current investment-grade credit ratings. safety remains the foundation for all that we do, and we're advancing that commitment with our accelerated sms implementation across our seven-state footprint. through sms, we're increasing our rigor to identify risks and taking action to keep our employees, contractors, customers and communities safe.
and we continue to execute on safety enhancements to our low-pressure system. our electric generation strategy is advancing with three wind projects approved and the fourth one proposed and the second rfp issued to identify additional sources to replace our coal capacity. our electric base rate case is on track with partial settlements in place and the hearing on contested issues complete and an iurc order expected this quarter. significant milestones have been achieved in our recovery from the merrimack valley event with the ntsb issuing its final report and the second phase of the restoration completed.
we continue to work to rebuild confidence and trust in the community. we're working diligently to assure the quality of last fall's construction work, and we brought in an experience gas safety leader who knows massachusetts. thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of nisource. we're now ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first response is from shar pourreza of guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, shar.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
so could we -- just a couple of questions here. could we just talk directionally about the earnings impact from the sale of columbia gas of massachusetts? so like, are you expecting any kind of dilution versus your prior 2020 guide? is there any opportunities to mitigate? i mean, obviously, you've eliminated a very large equity slug in 2020.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, shar. yes, we think there are opportunities to mitigate that. we are starting to work on that plan. but as i stated, when you look at the loss of the earnings, although massachusetts cma was not earning its allowed return on its rate base, but we do lose that impact of those earnings.
we will have some dis-synergies and we'll start working on a plan there to offset and mitigate some of those dis-synergies. but as we've stated and you have as well, we will not need to issue that equity, which helps minimize dilution. we'll go out to the rating agencies this spring and show them our plan and talk about the financing plan going forward. and so i think we'll need a few quarters or so really, to develop this plan, get closer to a transaction close and understanding the timing of that, as well as just the transition.
looking at a close by the end of the third quarter, but we also expect that there's going to be a transition of up to a couple of years to transition the business over to eversource. and so we need to take all of those items into account. having said that, we're confident that at a minimum, we'll be at or above this year's guidance, but certainly see the opportunity to do better. and it's in our interest to do better, as you'd expect.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
right. and then how should we sort of think about sort of the ongoing equity beyond '20, especially as we're layering capex around indiana generation, etc.? so like, do you see any scenarios -- mainly what i'm trying to get at is if there's any scenarios where there could be future block equity beyond sort of the atms and internal programs maybe to fund the ""significant investments"" you kind of mentioned in your prepared remarks? or do you sort of think your ongoing internal programs, atms is sufficient to fund what appears to be a pretty healthy capex program?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would say it's too early to say exactly what that financing program will be. that will be part of our discussions with the rating agency, as well as the board this spring to talk about how to finance, what the size of those investments are and how we finance that. certainly, the atm program has been a very good program for us.
but depending on the timing and size of those investments, the financing program will have to match up. and we expect that we will provide more details later in the year around that plan.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys. i'll jump back in the queue. appreciate it.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks, shar.
operator
thank you. your next response is from michael weinstein of credit suisse.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. so when you say that you have an estimate of the loss on the sale, is there any goodwill recovery factored into your expected retention of proceeds?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
so we did write off. we had goodwill on the books that we wrote off as of 12/31, as well as there was an intangible asset on our books related to the same-state gas purchase by nisource back in 1999 or 1998. both of those amounts were written off. it's about $415 million write-off that we did take at 12/31 this year.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
gotcha. and just a follow up on shar's question. is there any corporate overhead retained? i mean, you're talking about dis-synergies going forward? is there any quantification you can put on the corporate overhead?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
not at this point. i think what we're trying to do is develop a plan to help mitigate those dis-synergies. obviously, you can't eliminate them all because we will lose scale in our business, but what we're attempting to do is build a plan that offsets and mitigates that.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
gotcha. and can you just briefly review the additional, i guess, investigations that are still pending, seeing that you're still liable for any liabilities that are in connection with the incident, right?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right. so if you look at the -- there's still ongoing investigations in massachusetts with the dpu that we are working with the dpu. our hope and goal is to have those investigations resolved by the close of the transaction with eversource.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
gotcha. ok. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next response is from julien dumoulin-smith of bank of america. please go ahead. julien, your line is open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. can you hear me?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yeah, we can hear you now, julien.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
excellent. sorry about that. so i appreciate it. so let me come back to this, if i can, just in brief.
when you think about the timing-related issues on '20 versus the full-year run rate on '21, let's just focus on '21 here, how do you think about the puts and takes here? because without interjecting a specific earned roe on the massachusetts business directly, it would seem as if, roughly, excluding the dis-synergies, the equity would seem to offset the loss of earnings from the core business. that's my words, i just want to see how that reconciles with you just as we think about puts and takes off of the way the street and ourselves are already positioned on this.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's a good way to think about it. i don't know if it's exact offset, but i would say it's pretty close.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. so when you say -- so if i can put this back to you, so if it's pretty close, and i get that there's some slight dis-synergies or something, when you talk about '21 being similar to '20, was that to say that it was similar originally and that you're only now disclosing that for the first time? do you get what i'm saying?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
no. i'm sorry, could you --
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i apologize. let me try this again. so when you're talking about '21 now and you're saying that it'll be similar or above '20, was that originally the case under the prior plan? or is this transaction somehow actually resulting in a net negative to your '21 estimates, if it roughly nets out on '21 to begin with?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah. so if you take the premise that you stated around the loss of the cma earnings, offset by the dilution and then -- so both to offset and then we've got some dis-synergies from the loss of scale, there is a potential net negative from this transaction. and then that, as i said, is part of what we're working through to develop a plan, and it's really too early to give specific guidance around 2021. but otherwise, we would have expected to meet our 5% to 7% earnings per share and dividend per share growth guidance off of 2020.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. or if i may, one more time, '20 into '21 would have otherwise achieved the 5% to 7%, and the only delta that we're at least publicly aware about today is the slight dis-synergy on the sale of the business, assuming there's a broadly netting of one versus the other?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you for clarifying. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. your next response is from greg gordon of evercore isi.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, greg.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm going to beat a dead horse here, so please humor me. i apologize in advance. you guys, based on the very articulate guidance your team has given the street, have been earning a very low equity return in massachusetts. if we assume that the equity return was, practically speaking, sort of 50% of the authorized, and that's the net income that you're shedding when you sell the asset, then it does make complete sense that foregoing the equity issuance would offset that dilution.
but that just doesn't fit with you saying that your earnings in '21 could potentially be at the guidance range for '20 because if you then grow at 5% to 7% off of that, it implies '22 is anywhere from $0.07 to $0.10 below where it otherwise would have been based on the prior guidance when this, just based on basic algebra, should be a $0.05 or less dilutive. so you're implying that the dis-synergy could be fairly meaningful. and you have to understand, pulling the guidance gives investors quite a bit of agita around what they're missing that may be problematic in the underlying business away from just the puts and takes in this transaction. so if you can, could you please articulate in a little more detail how you're coming up with that notional at 2020 levels in '21?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yeah. greg, i don't know what other detail to give without giving you exact numbers that at this point we don't have. we're working through those details. but again, if you look at where we were, where we have committed to for 2020 net guidance, our plan all along was 5% to 7% off of that.
as you've stated and julien and i think others, we are underearning in massachusetts, we lose that. that was at full run rate, earning allowed return about 8% to 10% of our business. not earning that dilution does offset most of the impact of losing those earnings, but there's certainly the impact of dis-synergies that we've got. that will remain with the business for the amount that we can't mitigate or offset through other ways.
and so for me, that is the simple math in terms of the growth and the opportunity to grow going forward. because otherwise, our operating companies are strong, they are earning their allowed returns. we're continuing to make the investments. and that's actually why we didn't change our capital investment guidance.
we continue to invest in our program of about $1.9 billion, and that will continue going forward. and ultimately, that's what drives our earnings growth.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. so we don't have to worry about there being some significant change in your assumptions with regard to the financial or operating profile of the rest of the business?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right. yeah, o&m --
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
i just wanted to be 100% clear on that. it really is about what are you losing, the offsetting benefit of not issuing the equity and whatever we think the underlying dis-synergy will be. and we don't have to worry about anything else if we're trying to figure this out. is that fair?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that is very fair.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. your next response is from steve fleishman of wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah, hi. i just wanted to clarify prior questions because a few other questions said that you stated similar '21 versus '20. but if i heard you correctly, i thought you said a minimum of at or above the prior 2020 guide for 2021. so just to clarify, is that what you said? and then also -- yup, is that correct?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that is correct, at a minimum, the 2020 guidance.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
at or above that?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
at or above.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and would you say being at it would be a very conservative assumption?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
well, i don't want to start providing sensitivity around that. i would say that we are comfortable at that range for 2021, which is why we've given it. but at the same time, we think there's ability to be above that range and have growth off of that 2020 range.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. ok. and then just in terms of looking forward, so this transaction will close and you'll be kind of focused back to all the rest of the 93% of the company. and just is there any kind of -- if we kind of focus on that 93%, is there any kind of key things to watch this year outside of just really the -- probably the big event i'm aware of is the rfp outcomes.
but is there any other kind of key things to watch in your states?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yeah. steve, this is joe. i think you hit the big one. the work we're doing with the generation replacement, the rfps that are well under way is the key item that'll drive our longer-term guidance, particularly beyond 2021.
and we do expect to see more clarity on that quarter by quarter probably as we step through this year. the other thing i would say is the important point overarching and underpinning what donald has been talking about is the resilience of the nisource business plan. when you look at all the other states and the capital deployment there and the strong regulatory mechanisms, we're in that sort of season of looking at the regulatory cycle rate cases. and that'd be the space to watch as we go through the remainder of 2020, just the regulatory actions that we would expect to see that'll kind of set the stage for '21 and beyond.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next response is from charles fishman of morningstar. please go ahead.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
hi. good morning. if we could just move to capex for a minute, if i have the numbers right, you've actually moved up the capex range for 2020 $100 million. first of all, is that correct? did i get that right?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that is correct. that is correct.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and then you've pulled '21 and '22, or at least you're going to wait a quarter, and then you'll give us some guidance. but i would think with the kind of long-term programs you have with pipe replacements and things and the frameworks you have in place, and actually probably massachusetts was your weakest, we should be confident that that $1.7 billion to $2 billion annually that was the old guidance for '21 and '22, it's not going to be too different from that.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i agree. i agree. as we work through our safety management program and start to look at investments across our system and how to prioritize those investments, we're confident that that overall capex guidance range is not going to change. again, we'll provide more clear guidance and direct guidance probably around the third quarter of this year.
but certainly, we have resiliency and strength in our remaining states to continue this growth.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and then one sort of related investment question. a year ago, i think, or after the first round of irps in indiana, the big surprise was the cheap solar. and yet, obviously, you're moving forward with wind.
is solar still on the horizon here getting out five years? are you still seeing that as a viable option in indiana?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yeah. charles, definitely. if you look at the current rfp, and the team just did a public meeting, a virtual meeting on that and shared some of the indicative bid ranges around that. and you can see from that that solar is very much in the hunt for the future portfolio here, solar and storage both.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
and then related to that, the plan, i don't have it in front of me, but the coal closings that you accelerated, that's still on track?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's still on track, and we had, from the iurc, the final approval, if you want to call it that, of the directors' report in the irp that that supports the overall plan, as well as the rate case outcome that accelerated depreciation of the existing coal fleet, consistent with the early retirement. so we've seen all of the right regulatory support for the plan that we've put forward.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst

thank you. [operator instructions] your next response is from andrew levi of exoduspoint. please go ahead.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
hey, guys. how are you?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
hey, good morning, andy. good.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
hey, andy.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
obviously, most of the questions have been asked and answered well. just on the categories of things that you can mitigate to help '21 and beyond, could you just give us, like at a very high level, what categories you're talking about?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes. if you think about it, andy, it's really our shared costs across our corporate services and customer services that we need to develop a plan to help offset those dis-synergies that we've got. operating across seven states, both on the gas side, we've got some shared gas services, as well as just, i would say, our typical accounting, finance, it and corporate services that we allocate the costs across to our seven operating companies.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
so, i guess, it's more o&m related. and i guess, reallocating a portion of that to the other operating companies and getting it to go flow through your trackers, i guess, for no better way to put it, and then at the same time, try to cut costs?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i think that's all of the above, both from a recovery from other states, as well as continuing to find opportunities to be lower cost and more efficient.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
and then at the same time, i guess, be able to allocate the capex that you had at base state of -- was base state years ago, that's how old i am, into your other businesses, which you kind of have really begun to do it anyway, that's what was in your release today?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right. yeah, we'll be looking at that as well, at the opportunity to do that and have that capital go into those other states into their tracker programs.
andrew levi -- exoduspoint -- analyst
got it. ok, i understand it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the conference back over to joe hamrock, our ceo.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you, detamora, and thank you all for joining us. in closing, i would like to reiterate that our deep focus of providing value for our customers and our shareholders through comprehensive investments and programs that drive safety and risk mitigation remains at the center of our focus. and we appreciate your support and ongoing interest in nisource, and we look forward to engaging with you in the weeks and months ahead. have a safe day.

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the q4 2019 nisource earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. randy hulen, vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
please go ahead.
randy hulen -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, detamora, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nisource fourth-quarter 2019 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, chief executive officer; and donald brown, chief financial officer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019, as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions.
slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. before turning the call over to joe and donald, just a quick reminder. some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this recording relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. with all that out of the way, i would like to turn the call over to joe. 
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks, randy, and good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us. before i discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year results, i would like to take a few minutes to speak to the announcements made yesterday that we have reached a plea agreement with the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts intended to resolve the criminal investigation and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our columbia gas of massachusetts business to eversource. in addition to agreeing to pursue the sale of the columbia gas of massachusetts assets, we have also agreed to pay a $53 million criminal fine.
following a thorough evaluation by the board and management team, we believe this sale to eversource is in the best interests of all of our stakeholders, including shareholders. through this process, it was paramount to us that we find a partner for columbia gas of massachusetts who will create the right next chapter for not only columbia gas of massachusetts business but for the customers and communities it serves, as well as its dedicated employees. we believe eversource is that right partner. as new england's largest energy delivery company serving approximately 4 million electricity, natural gas and water customers in connecticut, massachusetts and new hampshire, they have tremendous familiarity with the region.
in addition, they have a proven track record of investing in infrastructure, employees and operations to enhance system reliability and safety. correspondingly, our focus across nisource is on enhancing safety, service and system reliability through implementation of our safety management system, infrastructure modernization and advanced workforce training programs. the transaction is supportive of those priorities for all of our stakeholders. yesterday's announcement is just the first step for this transaction, and we look forward to working closely with eversource to ensure a smooth transition.
throughout the approval and transition process, we will remain focused on customer service and enhancements in all areas of operations. now turning to our results for the quarter and the year. as we look back at 2019, it was a year in which our team's performance demonstrated the resiliency of the nisource business plan. our employees remained relentlessly focused on safety and customer satisfaction, starting with the accelerated implementation of our safety management system, as well as advancing our electric generation strategy in indiana and executing on nearly $1.9 billion in capital investments centered on infrastructure and safety in our gas and electric systems.
we also delivered non-gaap net operating earnings per share of $1.32, near the top of our guidance range for the year, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings and executing on our regulatory plan. turning now to slide 3. you can see some of our key accomplishments in 2019. our sms implementation and other system safety enhancements were and remain our top priority.
in 2019, we stood up an independent quality review board to oversee our progress and named a chief safety officer reporting directly to me. in addition, we integrated the functions of safety, compliance and risk and increased staffing and capabilities across our gas segment. we introduced a corrective action program, or cap, to identify, track and prioritize risk. and we installed more than 1,000 automatic shutoff devices on low-pressure gas systems across our footprint.
as i mentioned earlier, we delivered non-gaap net operating earnings per share of $1.32, near the top of our 2019 guidance range. due to the expectation of closing the columbia gas of massachusetts transaction this year, we are withdrawing our 2020 net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.36 to $1.40. however, we continue to expect to make capital investments of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in 2020. we also expect the transaction will enable nisource to eliminate its previously planned 2020 block equity issuance.
the long-term growth opportunity for the remaining operating companies is unchanged. as a result, following the completion of the transaction, the company expects to initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividend with 2021 as the base year. this new long-term guidance is expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include significant investments related to the company's electric generation strategy. reflecting on 2019, nisource achieved a number of key milestones.
in our electric business, we reached commercial agreements on multiple wind projects, completed a second round of requests for proposals for replacement generation capacity for our retiring coal plants and completed our coal combustion residuals capital investments. we made approximately $1.9 billion of capital investments in our gas and electric utilities primarily focused on safety improvements and infrastructure modernization. we executed on our regulatory initiatives, including approvals of our electric base rate cases in indiana and our gas base rate case in maryland and virginia. in the merrimack valley, we substantially completed the restoration following the september 2018 event, including the settlement of all the major customer claims and finishing substantially all service line verifications.
and we added about 28,000 net new gas customers across the company driven by healthy new construction and conversion markets. now i would like to turn the call over to donald who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe, and good morning, everyone. looking at our 2019 results on slide 4. we had a non-gaap net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share, compared to net operating earnings of about $463 million or $1.30 per share in 2018. the biggest drivers of our 2019 non-gaap financial performance compared to 2018 were higher net revenue due to the impact of our long-term infrastructure modernization investments, which were offset by increased safety-related spending and higher financing costs due largely to the greater lawrence incident.
now turning to slide 5, i would like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our debt level as of december 31, was about $9.6 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 17 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.4 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program.
our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment-grade, and we're committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings. i would now like to turn to slide 6, which covers our financing plan for our long-term growth investment. the agreement for a purchase price of $1.1 billion in cash, subject to adjustment based on columbia gas massachusetts net working capital as of the closing, the purchase price represents a loss compared to the book value of columbia gas of massachusetts. as a result of the asset sale transaction, we no longer expect to pursue our previously planned 2020 block equity issuance.
our current plan, which is focused on providing funding for ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs, has approximately $500 million of long-term debt in 2020 and continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at the market, or atm, equity issuance program, as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. as joe mentioned, due to the timing of this transaction, we are withdrawing our 2020 non-gaap net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.36 to $1.40. however, we continue to expect to make capital investments of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in 2020. following the completion of the transaction, we expect to initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividend with 2021 as the base year.
this new long-term growth rate is also expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include significant investments related to the company's electric generation strategy. as we work through the impact of the sale by factoring in the elimination of the block equity dilution, the loss of cma earning and the expected dis-synergies, we believe that at a minimum, the 2021 baseline is expected to be at or above our withdrawn 2020 guidance. now i'll turn the call back to joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now let's turn to some specific highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2020 from our gas operations on slide 7. in maryland, our base rate case request was approved by the public service commission and new rates went into effect in december. the order supports continued replacement of aging pipelines and adoption of pipeline safety upgrades.
columbia gas of kentucky received an order in december from the public service commission in its annual accelerated main replacement program rider adjustment case. the commission approved a modification to the amrp to expand its scope to cover capital investments, including safety enhancements to low-pressure systems and other risk-based investments identified under our sms program. as part of the order, the program was renamed to the safety modification and replacement program or smrp. we filed an application in december with the indiana utility regulatory commission for a six-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program.
the proposal includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge, or tdsic tracker. the existing gas tdsic program has been in place since 2014. an iurc order is expected in july 2020. now let's turn to our electric operations on slide 8.
our team is reviewing the results of our latest request for proposals to consider potential resources to meet the future electric needs of our customers. consistent with nipsco's 2018 integrated resource plan, the rfp sought to identify replacement sources for our coal capacity, which will be 100% retired by 2028 to be replaced by lower-cost, reliable and cleaner options. the plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over the long term. we considered all sources in the rfp process, which closed in november, and we're currently in early discussions with a number of commercial bidders who responded to the rfp.
progress continues on the active wind projects we've proposed in 2019. on december 19, the federal energy regulatory commission approved our section 203 and section 205 applications for rosewater, a 100-megawatt joint venture between nipsco and edp renewables. the iurc had previously approved the joint venture and ownership agreement for rosewater, as well as a power purchase agreement application for jordan creek. construction is under way on both rosewater and jordan creek, which are expected to be in service by the end of this year.
nipsco has notified the iurc of its intention to not move forward with the roaming bison project due to local zoning restrictions. last week, the iurc approved our application for an additional wind project, indiana crossroads, another joint venture with edp renewables. indiana crossroads will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts and is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021. in december, we received an order from the iurc in our electric base rate case with new rates effective in january 2020.
the order approved a partial settlement agreement filed in april 2019 that addresses the revenue requirement, federal tax reform and changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation as submitted in the irp. the order established a return on equity of 9.75%, reflecting a reduced business risk profile and positions nipsco to successfully execute on its generation strategy, which benefits its customers. we continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability. the program, originally approved by the iurc in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
our latest tracker update request covering $131.1 million in incremental capital investments made from december 2018 through june 2019 was approved by the iurc on december 18, 2019, with rates effective in january 2020. turning now to slide 9. i'll focus on our systemwide safety enhancements. safety is and will remain the foundation of everything we do across our business.
we are resolved to lead in safety and exceed industry standards, anchored by three pillars: a culture where everyone is empowered to identify and report risk, process safety that adds layers of protection and enhanced asset risk and analytics. a safety management system, or sms, is a comprehensive approach to managing safety, emphasizing continual assessment and improvement, as well as proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks. we made great progress on our sms implementation in 2019, and it remains our top priority in 2020. nearly 90% of our gas segment employees were trained in sms in 2019, and the remainder will be trained this year.
gas segment employees and contractors have embraced the cap tool, which offers a simple way for employees and contractors to report safety concerns and supports our systematic process to review, prioritize and track progress to reduce risk. in 2019, we worked closely with the national transportation safety board, which concluded its investigation into the greater lawrence event. we finished implementing the board's urgent safety recommendations, and ntsb deemed our responses as acceptable. in conjunction with its final report, ntsb issued a recommendation around enhancing our emergency preparedness and response capabilities.
we have implemented an incident command structure, or ics, aligned with federal emergency management agency standards and provided ics training to nearly all nisource employees. before we turn to the q&a portion of the call, i'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. as noted, with the expected closing of the columbia gas of massachusetts transaction this year, we are withdrawing our 2020 net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.36 to $1.40. we continue to expect to make capital investments of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in 2020, and we remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings.
we expect the transaction will enable nisource to eliminate its previously planned 2020 block equity issuance. following the completion of the transaction, we expect to initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividend with 2021 as the base year. as donald mentioned, we believe that at a minimum, the 2021 baseline is expected to be at or above our withdrawn 2020 guidance. our electric-generation strategy is advancing with our base rate case approved, wind project construction under way and the second rfp completed to identify additional sources to replace our coal capacity.
we have substantially completed our service line verification work in the merrimack valley, and we're cooperating fully with the massachusetts department of public utilities as it reviews the cause of september 2018 merrimack valley event and our emergency response. through the close of the transaction, nisource will remain focused on customer service and enhancements in all areas of operations. thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of nisource. we are now ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. your line is open.
unidentified speaker
hi, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
hey. good morning, shar.
unknown speaker
this is bob corl on for shar. i know you guys obviously pulled 2020 guidance because of the pending sale base rate gas. but as we think to 2021, prior language seems to allude 2021 should be at least as good as 2020. is that still the case and what are the drivers we should think about?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
hi. good morning. thanks for the question. thanks for the question.
as we think about covid and we're early on into trying to understand what this could mean to our business and the economies. i think it's little early to provide specific guidance on 2021. as we stated earlier, we haven't seen a significant impact in the first quarter, because of covid on -- from an expense standpoint or -- as well as a revenue standpoint, but we do expect we will see lower customer demand and some higher bad debt expense. so i think as we get -- go through the quarters, we'll be able to provide more guidance and insight as we learn what the impacts covid will have on our business going forward.
again, we don't think it affects our long-term growth drivers, but we do want to understand how it may impact our financials this year and our starting point next year.
unknown speaker
thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. your line is open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning to you. thank you for taking the time.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, julien.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
if i could follow-up on the last question -- just to level set here on '21 expectation, you all talked about it being largely flattish versus '20 earlier and some of that seems to be predicated on cost cuts to offset some of the earnings loss as part of the sale. how are you thinking about that today given, and i'm going to presuppose, a certain amount of incremental cost cut as you think about '21 to offset some of the lost demand that might spill over into '21 from '20 year?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes -- no, that's right. we continued to work on the separation plan with eversource and for our own purposes and understanding what the dissynergies are and what are those mitigation steps to help offset some of the impact of the loss earnings from massachusetts. certainly covid provides some incremental pressure as we think about operating expenses as well as cash flows, and so we're working through that. at this point, not having any specifics on what the revenue impacts will be, it's -- i'd say it's difficult to give any specific direction.
but as we do our scenario analysis and look at potential impacts to our customers, we are taking into -- we are taking that information into our analysis as we look at our own operating expenses and capital programs.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
and, julien, let me just [inaudible]
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so just to be clear you kind of [inaudible]
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, let me add just a little bit of differentiation. when you think about the cost profile related to the cma sale and the actions that we're taking there, those are really in the realm of changing cost structures on a permanent basis related to ongoing operations and largely across the shared enterprise platforms and enterprise cost pools, very different from what you might do to manage on a short-term basis through a downturn like this. some of the discretionary spending that largely often comes back in future spending. it's timing of spending that you often look at for those kind of efforts.
so i would differentiate the two efforts and highlight that our focus is on maintaining core strength for 2021 and beyond. so any cost-shaping actions we'll take at the edge of this year will be to manage, as donald said, through the tight spots here, but our core focus remains on execution capabilities and lean operating platforms for '21 and beyond. so there is a distinction there. there -- they may be co-mingle at times but largely they're separate and distinct efforts.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, i think the opportunity though [inaudible]
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i appreciate the comment. if i could just clarify that -- sorry. go for it, donald. i apologize.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, i'd say that because we've got a team that's focused on looking at the core operations and how we can change structure, even looking at some of the temporary levers that we may be able to execute goes hand-in-hand with that work.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. so even -- but just to clarify, with respect to that earlier expectation of flattish guidance, you're not necessarily restating that at this point in time, given the various puts and takes here? just want to be clear about that.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i would say that it's too early to provide that guidance for 2021, not knowing what the impact of covid will be on the business.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. and then, if i can just go quickly, how are you seeing the april sales trend thus far? i know you sort of talked on the 1q impact thus far but curious, what are you currently seeing if you can, just to give us a little bit of a sense of the flavor of the order of magnitude?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, we're actually closing the books this week and so i don't have any specifics i can give you just yet. we'll have that, i'd say, over the next week and as we get more information and can provide that to investors, we will do so. yes, the one thing that we are thinking about though, and i've said it on the -- our investor fireside chat a couple of weeks ago, this part of the year is a shoulder season. and so it's a lower supply and demand season, and so it's also little bit hard to translate what we'd see from an april standpoint into a long-term impact on the business as well as just understanding what businesses our customers are doing temporarily versus what they do long-term.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
excellent. thank you, all, for your patients.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thank you.

your next question comes from david peters with wolfe research. your line is open.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes, hi. good morning. hope you and your families are doing well.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
on the rfp in indiana, when should we expect an update on incremental capex opportunities? and how do you guys see that shaping kind of the long-term growth trajectory of the company?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, let me about the timing as we view it now and then donald can talk about the longer-term view to the extent that it's coming into view at this point. so we're -- as we noted earlier, we're in the negotiations phase with the bidders into the rfp. we expect to come through that here in the next few months. so i would expect to see the regulatory filings associated with that, cpcn is associated with that, with the mix of ppas and the jv tax equity structures later this summer, maybe around our q2 call, we'll see.
we'll just see how that plays out, but later this summer, we should have a lot more to talk about in terms of the mix, and that would obviously lay out the timetable for investments on both sides of that equation. as it relates to the longer term capex and growth profile, let me ask donald to talk about current outlook on that.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, i think it's -- that guidance in terms of long-term growth and the 2021 base that we've talked about will likely be in the third quarter, so that we can talk about. here is what we're seeing for 2021, here's what the investment plan looks like over the next horizon. and again, we expect to extend that beyond 2022 to take into account the generation investments.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then another question i had just on the 2020 capex. is that $100 million being deferred until say, next year or soon after or how should we just think about that $100 million?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i'd look at it as it's a reduction this year, but obviously, it's work that we need to do. we will have to find -- determine when we would make those investments in the future. we haven't looked that far out to say what -- how that might impact 2021 or 2022, but ultimately, it's long-term investments that we're making in the business.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
and your next question comes from insoo kim with goldman sachs. your line is open.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. my first question is on nipsco electric. could you just give a little bit more color on the types of commercial and industrial business customers that you serve?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. let me touch on it. i think probably the most notable part of the profile from a low perspective is the concentration of energy-intense industrials, the steel and petrochem profile that we have there. and those customers, as you may recall, are under a new rate structure that was implemented with the rate case from last year that essentially shifts the capacity commitment profile for us to the firm portion of the load and that allows them to buy through to the market on a ongoing basis.
a novel approach to derisk that for us and for them and for our other customers, and you will note, if you look at industrial sales, q1 of '20 versus q1 of '19, you'll note a decline in industrial sales, a significant portion of which is related to that buy through. so it's by design that we have some of that decline in there and we did see about a 6.5% decline on industrial electric q1 '20 versus q1 '19. the remainder is a pretty diverse set of sectors, the remainder of our commercial and industrial loads, a pretty diverse set of sectors across a growing part of the state and so we see good diversity and good economic development there as well. we saw load and i would just highlight the load profile.
if you look at the results for the quarter, on the electric side, residential load down quarter one versus quarter one of last year, same for commercial and that's been a bit of a continuing trend on use per customer. and by contrast, on the gas side of this business, residential sales were up about 3% across our footprint year-on-year and commercial up close to 5%, all of which, as we noted before, was pre-covid impact. so we're not really seeing covid impacts in that. and then the industrial, slightly down on the gas side.
so -- and we continue to see our customer count increase as we've gone through the first quarter here. we added a little more insight than you asked for, but i want to make sure the whole picture was in focus there.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's really good color. and my other question is, can you just give an update on the latest timing of the massachusetts dpu's investigation into the merrimack incident and is a final outcome on that required at all to close on the utility sale?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
that all remains on track. we're, as you would expect, engaged right now with stakeholders in the early phases of that process. people continue to work through that even with the covid implications for work from home. we've seen very good progress on that.
we expect that to close, as we noted earlier on the call, by the end of the third quarter of this year, would note that there is the possibility of some slight delay just from the workload issues and the way covid might impact these working conditions, but we're confident in that. and we are viewing that and approaching that as a combined effort to resolve all matters related to massachusetts, including the pipeline safety investigation, and so it's all essentially on the table and in the mix together.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and also just, is that outcome required for the completion of the sale to eversource?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
well, again, it's -- again we've put all of the matters together into the sale. it's an opportunity for a comprehensive package to -- for nisource to exit the state and eversource to kind of take the ongoing operations.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you very much and stay safe everyone.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you. you too.

your next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse. your line is open.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, just to be clear about the long term guidance of 5% to 7%, you indicated a base year of 2021, that base year would include -- you're expecting that all of these cost savings to offset the synergies from the sale of massachusetts, will be in that 2021 base year at that point right? there is not going to be an additional savings which would flow into 2022 and beyond?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes -- good morning, michael. i'd actually expect that there would be savings that are ongoing. there's timing to some of the change in operations. if you think about doing a transaction, part of the work that we've got to do to separate will take multiple years.
what we've got in this agreement is a transaction services agreement that lasts up to 30 months. and so as we analyze what that tsa looks like, we expect that we'll have some savings immediately because we won't have to do that work and we can take advantage of those savings opportunities. but over time, as the tsa comes off as well as we make other structural changes to our cost profile, that will take a couple of years.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
gotcha. and you're still saying it's about a $0.05 or so of ets synergies that you're expecting after the sale is completed?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
i could see it in the range -- that being in the range of savings.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
on the generation -- the new generation investments that you're expecting, you indicated there will be some financial partners involved non-related to nipsco. are we talking about tax equity partners on wind projects or are we talking about something else here? and what kind of an arrangement is that?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
that's right, that's right. we are looking at tax equity partners to be able to take advantage of the tax credits related to those renewable investments and to support the utility being able to rebase those investments.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
so does that mean that at the end of the five-year period, recapture period that those tax equity partners would want to exit the investment and nipsco would gain more of the investment at that point, rebase would increase?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, the way it's structured that over time it's a build-own-transfer arrangement. so over time, there would be steps where we would pick up more of the overall joint ventures.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you. that's all i have.

your next question comes from chris sighinolfi with jefferies. your line is open.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
good morning.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
good morning.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe a follow up on that last question, joe. just had a -- you talked about with the irp having a combination of partners but also things that you'd be investing yourself. i'm just wondering, how you think about the allocation of that or the breakdown of that? is that the attributes of a particular project? is that just the capital budget constraints of nisource in any particular period of time? can you just give us a sense of how you think about that component through time?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, it's really about optimizing the mix, and starting with cost to customer as the key driver. when we analyze the rfp and the bids, we had a mix of ppa bids. bids that could go either ppa or jv and some straight jv. and as we optimize that portfolio, the 50%-ish blend is what looks like the solution set that balances best cost to customer with the right ownership structure for us and opportunities for us, all subject to continuing negotiation and continuing evaluation, but that's kind of the target zone we're operating in right now.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. so i guess, as we think about the profile through time that's -- that mix shift is something that could be something that's fairly constant or do you expect to have more nipsco participation earlier in the irp process or later or could you give any color on that?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, i think we'll take a one step at a time as we go through. we certainly want to look for ownership opportunities and investment opportunities and i would say we have a preference for that, but we want to do that in a balanced way that reflects the best interest of all of our stakeholders. and so we'll take each step in this, each tranche on a kind of an independent basis and look at the portfolio needs at a point in time.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. i also had two other questions. i was just -- there's an earlier question about and you kind of talked about the change in the nipsco customer set and rate dynamics maybe certainly since the last recession. and clearly columbia has been spun off since -- columbia pipeline since that time, but i'm just curious, if there is any other things that you maybe have gone back through and looked at the performance of the company in '08-'09 just as like a proxy set and maybe just some of the things, if we were to do that, that you would point out that are quite a bit different this time versus that time or maybe any learnings from that time that inform how you and donald think about the business.
i know you're not giving guidance and i know you're still assessing covid impacts and the dynamic this time is different, but there is still obviously an economic component. just curious, any thoughts on that.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a good, good question, because it's a reference case, but you almost use it as a reference from which you adjust what's different about today and what's different about this particular set of circumstances. and the one thing that, as we've said and donald highlighted is difficult and you're seeing it all around is sector-by-sector, you could see very different depths and duration. some that might bounce right back and might bounce back stronger, some that are likely to see a little bit slower recovery and maybe don't recover back to where they were prior to this.
and it's that blend of almost sector-by-sector and across our seven states or six-states as we go into 2021, the unique blend of those different sectors that we are analyzing very carefully and trying to get indicators, if you will, of what recovery looks like. and so we're early in trying to get to the next level of this detail on that, but i think ultimately, when you start to look at that, it's a very different profile than what we experienced in '08, '09 and as you noted, our mix is different. we now have, without the pipeline group as you noted and with the different rate structure for our large industrials more protections in place, so to speak. we're better positioned or better hedged against some of the risks we faced here.
so it's really -- starts to become more of a duration question that, i think, ultimately and that's why as we step through q2, i think we're going to get a much better sense of what we're seeing both in april as donald noted, we'll see that pretty soon. and then by the end of q2, even being shoulder months for our whole business for the most part, it's more of the economic recovery that will give you the leading indicators for q3, q4 and beyond when we'll be out of the shoulders. and so looking forward to having more depth and detail on that, i want to be careful not to try to be overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. i think we just have to step through this with eyes wide open.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
no, sure. no, that's helpful. we'll pay attention to those data points as well. i guess, the final question from me, joe, is just with regard to massachusetts, i know you guys have given in your qs the updates in terms of insurance recoveries and i know you've been somewhat cautious about anticipating any on the asset front.
i'm just curious where that stands and what those discussions look like.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, we're still in the midst of having discussions with our property insurer. the litigation was filed last quarter but we'll continue to have conversations. it's still too early to give any guidance on what any type of recovery might be there or even the timing, but i'd say that we are in constructive conversations with them.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. is there a normal like length of time that you'd anticipate, donald, for that process to take or is it just everyone's unique and the range is too wide to even speculate?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
yes, it is. it's -- every situation is very unique in terms of the information that you're providing as well as the negotiations.
chris sighinolfi -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. well, thanks a lot for the time this morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks. stay safe.
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from charles fishman with morningstar. your line is open.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
thank you. joe, just one maybe point of clarification. on the $100 million capex reduction for this year, it sounded like it was more of a decision to delay some projects timing because of rate cases, the appetite of customers or regulators to take incremental rate increase, things like that rather than a supply chain issue. is my read of that correct?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
it's really neither. it's more managing cash flow through this year and recognizing we're likely in a tight spot for a little while here and want to make sure we're prudent and taking prudent steps as we go. and as noted earlier, donald talked about it, just by the nature of our capital portfolio, it's long dated. and when we take a step like this, which by the way puts us on the same profile we've been on for the last couple of years, 1.7 to 1.8 is consistent with where we've been.
this year was elevated a bit. so it's really just timing of key initiatives and probably blended across both the tracked capital, growth capital, and our maintenance capital. so likely to just have a very modest effect on the future.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. and then another question related to capex. slide 17, which shows a recovery of those investments, every time i look at that slide, the upper two bars seem to go higher, which is good.
in other words, your recovery keeps getting shorter and more within the 18 months. you're up to, on this chart now, 80% yet down at the bottom, it says, greater than 75%. should i expect those two upper bars to come down a little or are you just little -- i mean, the some -- greater than 75% is obviously correct. but where should we -- over time, we've seen those go up, but what should we expect in the future?
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a good insight and a good question and you may notice that we've moved 2020 into roughly $10 million, roughly $70 million, roughly $20 million, because it's the nature of the $100 million pullback and how that ultimately lands, that will move a little bit across those different categories, but your question about the long term. if you look backwards, we had some larger generation projects and our larger electric transmission projects that were in the mix and that's why you'd see the more pronounced shift in the mix back a few years. as you go forward, the next couple of years, what you can see here is likely to be what we'll continue to see until and unless we get to the generation investments that we've been talking about, the replacement portfolio. we'd see a couple of years there of an excursion on what we view as the periodic rate cases or the maintenance and other.
we would likely see those show up right in that category for a short period of time but, obviously, we'd have that combined with a regulatory strategy for those kind of investments.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. that's all i have. stay safe, guys.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, charles. stay safe.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to joe hamrock for closing remarks.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks, mariana, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in and support of nisource. as is the case for all of us, around the communities we serve and all of our stakeholders, we're navigating through this covid crisis carefully and thoughtfully and we'll continue to stay transparent and talk with you about any implications we see and share any outlook on our business. we appreciate the time today and look forward to the next opportunity. please stay safe.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q1 2020 nisource earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, nick drew, director of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
nick drew -- director of investor relations
thank you. good morning, and welcome to the nisource first-quarter 2020 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, our chief executive officer; and donald brown, our chief financial officer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the first-quarter 2020 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans.
following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. before turning the call over to joe and donald, just a quick reminder. some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking.
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.
with all of that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe. 
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thanks nick. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. before i summarize our performance in the first quarter, i want to take a moment to comment on the current global crisis and to thank our dedicated employees for the critical and tremendously important work they do every day to keep america running in our service areas. this pandemic has highlighted just how critical the nisource team's work is to the communities that we serve.
early on in the crisis, the states we serve designated us as a central service providers, recognizing that we provide an essential service to millions of end user customers across our service area. this also reflects the critical support we provide to the other essential service providers, hospitals, emergency responders, food providers, and key supply chain operators on the front lines of this crisis. those essential service providers are depending on us and our peers across the utility industry to continue to deliver a safe and uninterrupted supply of gas and electric power so they can also continue their critical work. we are deeply grateful for the dedication and selflessness of those on the front lines of this crisis and for the opportunity we have to support their important and life-saving work.
we have activated our incident command structure to coordinate strategy, execution, and communication across our seven-state operating area. to protect our employees, we have encouraged all those who can work from home to do so. for those employees who must report to a work location, we have implemented social distancing protocols, temperature checks for people entering the critical company buildings, more frequent cleaning of facilities and equipment, and allowing only one person at a time in vehicles while doing our work. also, certain critical functions have activated sequestration plans to prevent any outbreak among our employees in specialized functions necessary to continue providing safe, reliable service to our customers.
nisource's sequestration approach is consistent with others in the utility industry. across nisource, we are following health and safety protocols recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention and federal, state, and local governments. we have taken a number of actions to help customers through the covid-19 pandemic, including the suspending of shut-offs for non-payment until further notice and offering our most flexible payment plans to customers impacted by or facing hardship due to covid-19. additional measures the company has taken to protect customers include directing field employees to practice strict social distancing at any company -- customer premise and minimizing non-essential field work that requires entering a customer's home.
in march, the nisource charitable foundation committed nearly $1.5 million in donations to provide relief support across our footprint. this included a $1 million donation to the american red cross in nearly $500,000 to support operating company initiatives at the local level. these donations are intended to support the delivery of care and comfort to communities in need across our footprint as a result of the covid-19 public health crisis. while we can't see with perfect clarity how this crisis will play out, we remain confident that we will get through this and we'll emerge a stronger country and a stronger organization.
we are resolute in our dual commitments to deliver essential gas and electric service to our customers and the equally important duty of protecting health and safety of around 8,400 dedicated employees. our business plan is resilient and will help us emerge from this event positioned to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. now turning to slide 3, and our results and key takeaways for the first quarter, our non-gaap net operating earnings per share of $0.76, compared to $0.82 per share in the first-quarter 2019. the first quarter of 2020 have largely played out prior to covid reaching crisis proportions in the united states and therefore, was minimal pandemic impact on our first-quarter results.
as we've all seen the continued spread of covid-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity. we are continuing to evaluate the range of potential impacts of the pandemic on our business and on our future operating results and liquidity. we currently expect to experience decreased sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers and increased bad debt expenses. we may experience sustained customer attrition.
we will continue to manage these impacts and we'll update you in future quarters as details become known. in order to help mitigate potential impacts on our cash flow, we have lowered our capital plan by $100 million and we now expect to make investments of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. we also recently took a pair of actions to reduce financing risk and increased liquidity. on april 1st, we refinanced our $850 million term loan with a new maturity date of march 31, 2021.
on april 13th, we issued $1 billion of 3.6% notes due may 1, 2030. additionally, this previously announced sale of columbia gas of massachusetts' assets to eversource energy remains on track to close in the third quarter of 2020, and will provide additional liquidity. we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. you will recall that we withdrew our non-gaap earnings guidance in february due to the pending cma sales transaction.
we continue to believe that the long-term growth opportunity for our remaining operating companies is unchanged. we expect to, following the completion of the cma transaction, initiate 2021 of net operating earnings per share guidance and restate a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as the base year. this long-term guidance is expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investment opportunities related to the electric generation strategy, which continues to advance. and while discussions with bidders in our latest rfp are ongoing, we're currently targeting ownership of approximately half the generation portfolio needed to replace our retiring coal plants.
this presents incremental capital investment opportunities in 2022 and 2023. with respect to our safety management system implementation, it's important to know that even with our current pandemic response efforts, our broader safety enhancements will remain a top priority. sms continues to mature in our gas business and in 2020, we have begun to implement sms in our electric business as well. we are enhancing risk identification through our corrective action program, which is providing valuable analytical insights.
we are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we're enhancing our gas emergency preparedness and response capabilities, including the deployment of the new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. safety remains the foundation of our business. our safety enhancements are delivering value in multiple ways, including the activation of our enhanced incident command structure to manage through the covid-19 pandemic. now, i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
donald?
donald brown -- chief financial officer
thanks, joe, and good morning, everyone. looking at our first-quarter results on slide 4, we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per share, compared to net operating earnings of about $308 million or $0.82 per share in 2019. the year-over-year decline was driven primarily by increased safety and o&m costs and reduced industrial demand in the electric business, offset somewhat by increased revenue from base rate proceedings, our infrastructure replacement program, and the effects of gas segment customer growth. as a reminder, most of the first quarter played out prior to the pandemic-related shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in our states, so these results really do not reflect any meaningful covid impact.
now turning to slide 5, i'd like to briefly touch on the debt and credit profile. our debt level as of march 31st was about $9.9 billion, of which about $7.7 billion was long-term debt. the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 17 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. at the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.3 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs.
our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade, and we're committed to maintaining current investment grade ratings. so, i'd now like to turn to slide 6. this covers our financing plan for a long-term growth investments. as we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, as a result of the cma asset sale transaction, we no longer expect to pursue our previously planned 2020 block equity issuance.
in april, we refinanced our $850 million term loan and issued $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 3.6% coupon. we expect these transactions will provide us the necessary liquidity to manage through the impacts of the pandemic. our current plan, which is focused on providing the funding for our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs continues to include annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from our at-the-market or atm equity issuance program as well as $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. to-date, the pandemic has not presented significant barriers for our safety and infrastructure modernization programs.
as joe mentioned earlier, we have, as a cash conservation measure, we scaled back our capital investment plan by a $100 million and we now expect to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in 2020. a warmer-than-normal january and february provided us some flexibility in our capital execution this year, but we're monitoring the covid-19 situation closely and we'll stand ready to make further adjustments as necessary. we're also active on the state regulatory front as we seek relief related to incremental covid pandemic expenses, including bad debt. in april, we received orders from state commissions in maryland and virginia giving us authority to defer incremental covid-related expenses for recovery at a later date.
we're currently working with our regulators in other states to also address covid-related financial impacts. ultimately, the length and severity of the covid pandemic will determine how significant the impact on our financial performance will be, but we haven't seen anything yet that would negatively impact our long-term growth drivers. we continued to expect that following closing of the massachusetts transaction later this year, we will initiate 2021 net operating earnings per share guidance and establish a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate for both net operating earnings per share and dividends with 2021 as our base year. this new long-term growth rate is also expected to be extended beyond 2022 to include incremental investments related to our electric generation strategy.
now, i'll turn the call back to joe for a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.
joe hamrock -- chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now let's turn to some highlights for the first quarter and early second quarter of 2020 from our gas operations on slide 7. in pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case last month with the public utility commission seeking an annual revenue increase of $100.4 million to invest in, modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. an order and new rates are expected to become effective in january 2021.
the same day as our pennsylvania rate case, we filed a petition with the puc requesting the authority to implement a temporary program that would make grants to residential customers who are experiencing a loss of income due to the covid-19 pandemic, but who were not eligible to participate in our existing assistance programs. we proposed to use a portion of pipeline penalty credits that the puc has previously approved for hardship funds, matched by a contribution from the nisource charitable foundation to fund the grants. this is an example of how we're looking for ways to help our most vulnerable customers weather this pandemic financially, which is a priority for us across all of our states. in ohio, the public utilities commission approved our annual infrastructure replacement program tracker adjustment.
this order allows us to begin recovery of approximately $234 million in safety and infrastructure investments made in 2019. this well-established pipeline replacement program, authorized through 2022, covers replacement of priority mainline pipe in targeted customer service lines. new rates from this most recent filing went into effect this month. the ohio commission is also reviewing our latest annual adjustment request for our capital expenditure program writer.
this writer allows us to recover capital investments and related deferred expenses that are not recovered through the irp. the pending application seeks to begin recovery of approximately a $185 million in capital invested in 2019 and an order is expected in august of 2020. in indiana, our application for a six-year extension of our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program remains pending before the utility regulatory commission. this proposal includes nearly $950 million in capital investments through 2025, to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or tdsic tracker.
the existing gas tdsic program has been in place since 2014. an iurc order is expected in july 2020. now, let's turn to our electric operations on slide 8. construction is under way on both the rosewater and jordan creek wind projects.
both projects are expected to be placed in service by the end of this year. though inside that schedule, the rosewater project could experience a construction delay due to the covid-19 pandemic. we will continue to monitor closely any possible construction impacts related to the pandemic. the iurc on february 19, 2020, approved our application for a third wind project, indiana crossroads, a joint venture with edp renewables north america.
indiana crossroads will have an aggregate nameplate capacity of 302 megawatts and is expected to be in operation in the fourth quarter of 2021. discussions continue with a number of commercial bidders who responded to our request for proposals which closed in november of 2019. the rfp results were consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, which calls for 100% of our coal capacity to be retired by 2028 and to be replaced by lower cost, reliable, and cleaner options. the plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to save our electric customers more than $4 billion over 30 years.
nipsco is considering all sources in the rfp process and is expecting to obtain adequate resources to facilitate the retirement of the r.m. schahfer generating station in 2023. currently, half of this capacity in the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include nipsco and unrelated financial investors as the members. the remaining new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of purchase power agreements.
nipsco expects to begin the appropriate regulatory compliance filings related to the new capacity as agreements are finalized with counterparties in 2020 and 2021. the planned replacement in 2023 of approximately 1,600 megawatts of retiring coal-fired generation could provide incremental nisource capital investment opportunities for 2022 and 2023. we continue to execute on our seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system that's designed to further improve system safety and reliability. the program, originally approved by the iurc in 2016, includes approximately $1.2 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
new rates under our latest modernization tracker update became effective in january of 2020. turning now to slide 9, i'll focus on our systemwide safety enhancements. we are resolved to lead in safety and exceed existing industry standards anchored by three pillars, a culture where everyone is empowered to identify and report risk, process safety that adds layers of protection, and enhanced asset risk analytics and management practices. our ongoing implementation and refinement of the safety management system or sms based on api's rp 1173 is driving improved planning and performance across our gas business.
we've made great progress in our sms implementation in our gas business and we've begun to introduce these practices in our electric business as well. in our gas business, we have advanced the maturity of risk identification through the corrective action program or cap, which provides extended insights and enhanced analytics. we are also piloting the use of mobile gas leak detection technology and we have also matured our gas emergency preparedness in response capabilities, including the ongoing deployment of new state-of-the-art mobile command centers. ultimately, we're really driving toward having new tools like cap to help identify, analyze, and proactively mitigate risk, new risk informed programs, projects and rate cases, and more flexibility in risk investments.
this work will continue to be a priority in 2020 and beyond. turning to slide 10, i'd like to focus for a moment on our ongoing focus on environmental, social, and governance matters. while this slide is new to our presentation, our focus on esg is not new. we have been reporting on esg and sustainability for more than a decade now.
as many of you likely have seen, we recently published our 2019 integrated annual report. if you haven't already, i encourage you to check it out at nisource.com. the report now discusses our renewed commitment to strengthening our safety culture, modernizing our energy delivery infrastructure, transforming our electric business, reducing our emissions and contributing to the communities in which we live and work. last summer, we published our 2018 climate report, also available at nisource.com, which is aligned with the framework developed by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures.
we also have a track record of being recognized for our sustainability performance. for instance, we have been named to the dow jones north america sustainability index for six consecutive years. we've also been named to the ftse4good index as well as a number of sustainability indexes maintained by s&p. we have an aggressive goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels.
we reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 13% in 2019, bringing the total decrease to 48% from 2005 levels. we were a founding member of the epa's methane challenge program in 2016 and we hold a top 20% environmental performance score from the institutional shareholder services. and in january, we were named to the bloomberg gender equality index for the third consecutive year. the gei tracks the financial performance of public companies committed to supporting gender equality through our policy development, representation, and transparency.
we are committed to being recognized throughout our communities as one of the best places to work and grow and gender equality is a critical component of our inclusion and diversity efforts. before we take your questions, i'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. we remain focused on maintaining safe and reliable energy service through the covid-19 pandemic. we have taken these financial steps which position nisource with ample liquidity to manage through the crisis and we're seeking supportive regulatory relief with respect to incremental pandemic expenses.
we will continue to manage potential financial impacts and provide you more details as they become known. consistent with recent years, we expect to complete $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in capital investments in 2020 and continue to expect to be close on the cma asset sale transaction in the third quarter and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. we continue to prioritize safety initiatives across our footprint even as we manage through the pandemic. this includes implementation of our sms, which continues to mature across our gas business and is being rolled out in our electric business in 2020.
our electric generation strategy is advancing with our wind project construction continuing, our coal-fired generation retirement is on track and incremental capital investment opportunities identified as we further develop our replacement portfolio. safety and infrastructure investments continue across our gas business with tracker updates progressing in this new base rate case filed in pennsylvania. thank you all for participating today [audio gap] of nisource. we're now ready to take your questions.

yes, i mean in essence, we'll follow a process and the pattern that looks a lot like what we went through in 2018 will kick-off the process with stakeholder engagement relatively soon and then in the middle of this summer after we develop scenarios is when you likely see to the extent it helps provide insight any rfps that might be included. keep in mind that the retirement schedule for the michigan city plan drived the capacity need for the future, because we pretty much got the 2023 capacity replacement plan set and so rfps may or may not be as valuable looking out that far from a 2021 vantage point. so we'll take all of that under consideration.
the one thing i'd say though, mike and i think this is obvious to all of us with the current events that are going on across the industry right now, it just starkly demonstrates that reliability and capacity are essential. and the integrated resource planning process itself is critically important. so that's why our approach really starts with reliability and balances all the other attributes against that fundamental requirement. so this experience that we're seeing now will be critical -- should provide critical learning for us as we go through the next round of the irp and so i don't want to predict with a high degree of precision, even the process at this point because there's a lot to learn from what's happening in the markets.
mike weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. hey, could you -- i know you don't want -- i don't want to front run what might happen with -- in pennsylvania, but could you talk about what the future pace of rate filings is likely to be based on the needs [indecipherable] investment that's going on in that state and what do you think will happen next after this rate case decision comes out?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
you're specifically asking about pennsylvania. yes, we...
mike weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
pennsylvania, yes.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'm not going to speculate about and outline, we should see a commission decision soon enough and we'll certainly keep you and all of our stakeholders updated as that plays out. and i won't front run any future filings, but if you look at the pace of investment in pennsylvania and the historic cycle there, we've had over about a decade eight rate cases settled with the stakeholders in pennsylvania and well supported by the commission. so i think that track record in that pattern is a good indicator, because our investment pace is as much -- is a strong as ever in pennsylvania is a good indicator of what the future will likely look like, especially with the fully forecasted rate year convention it almost sets up a pattern that calls for an annual filing and that we've only missed that may be one time in the last decade, missed or may be one year out of the last 10 where we didn't file an annual case. so good indicators, but not precisely front running any plans at this point. and i think it will be important to see the outcome in this case before we make any of those decisions.
mike weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. one last question on convertibles and hybrids financing going forward, you mentioned that you'd be looking at that opportunistically. what point do you think you'd be ready to make a decision regarding common equity versus convertibles and hybrids?
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, michael. so as i said earlier, we plan to actually issue a hybrid or convertible in the first half of this year. and so, ultimately has talked about looking at structure to provide at least 50% equity content from the rating agencies, then ultimately, depending on the size and equity content of that security, it will then indicate how much equity we'd need, block equity we would need in 2022 or 2023. but we plan to execute that in the next few months and certainly the first half of the year.
mike weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
i see and then you derate it to make a decision about the following year.
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
that's right. yes, then we'd be able to update.
mike weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
got you. okay, thank you very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, michael.

our next question comes from the line of harry pollans with bank of america. go ahead please. your line is open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's julien actually.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning julien.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so we're putting the name here this morning. so i suppose just the clean-up on that last question on equity, if i can and brief the total amounts are not shifting around and suggesting the form and then more importantly, can you talk -- discuss timing to the extent to which you would actually pull forward that block that would delay the convert in any way or just to clarify that a little bit under that scenario what that looks like? is that still a '21, let's get everything done kind of issuance?
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. the plan is this year, we would do the issuance of the hybrid or the convertible and then based upon that, so ultimately, we're looking for, if you assume $2 billion of renewable investments -- $2 billion of renewable investment, 60% equity content. so that's $1.2 billion of equity content. we'll execute the hybrid or convertible this year and then depending on the equity content coming out of that we balance that out with the block later.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. all right.
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
you can do that block in '22 or '23. so we've got some timing and flexibility on that block.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sorry, to clarify that. when you say depending on the equity content, there is no -- you're not firm on what kind of equity treatment you will get based on what you're looking at today?
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. we know we can get at least 50% equity content in the structures we're looking at -- we're also trying to achieve more than that. if we can get more than that and then depending on the size of the quantity of that security that will ultimately then determine what's the balance of equity we need.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, understood. and then not to make too much, what's the reason for the tweak in the '21 capex as well. just also want to make sure i understand the financing of the year?
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
no, it's not really a tweak in our capex. at investor day, we gave a wide range to incorporate the four years of investment and so it's consistent with our plan to kind of tighten up for the prompt year, and the capex that we have guided for this year is aligned with our long-term guidance. so no changes.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. excellent. sorry. one last one that's not a clarification, if i can. there are a lot of legislative bills out there this session. this is a lot going on in indiana, anything that we should be paying attention to that could impact broadly speaking to renewable efforts and/or your ldc. i'm just trying to make sure we're not missing anything here across a lot of different developments, but i'm sure you guys are tracking [indecipherable]?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, julien and we're as you would expect engaged and closely following all of that and i would describe the full set of initiatives as especially trying to create or level the playing field for renewable investment to make sure that there is a clear playing field. all of that to us is neutral to positive for our plan. i don't -- we don't see anything that is of concern, certainly we'll keep an eye out for that and then i would note, part of the puzzle that's playing out is for the natural gas side of the business for the state to prohibit local ordinances that might restict the use in natural gas. and i think that's a key indicator of policy support for the whole business in indiana.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, great. excellent. i'll leave it there. thank you guys very much. have a good day.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you and you too.

our next question comes from the line of richard sunderland with jpmorgan securities. go ahead please. your line is open.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions today. just maybe at a high level thinking about the first heating season under covid conditions, curious how you've been managing through that particularly on the gas side. and any takeaways you can provide at this point on realized impact versus that base scenario $0.05 baked into '21?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, richard. and i'll kick that off. i'll note that front and center for us has been and will always be the health, safety and wellness of our employees and safety for our customers and that's a key driver of the whole outlook for covid. regarding the economic recovery and you can see from our results the reason to be what i'd call cautiously optimistic, though there is other impacts to consider including ongoing expenses that could relate to adjustments to work protocols, other revenue collections, regulatory treatment and potential aftershocks in the economy and all of those are hard to predict, but certainly something we should all be attentive to. all considered to the spirit of your question and recognizing that we're deep in the first quarter, right now, and clearly deep in the heating season with the weather we are experiencing across the country. our guidance reaffirmation today reflects our base case for 2021 and also our long-term growth rate.
from a margin standpoint, the residential usage has remained strong. it really came out of the block strong at the beginning of the covid pandemic. and we've seen that trend continue into 2021. commercial usage has been consistently down and continues to be a profile that we're going to closely monitor and perhaps is the most strong indicator of recovery across our territories. industrial usage admittedly not all perfectly correlated with covid facrors, there is a number of things that can drive industrial usage. so it's hard to say deterministically that it's all covid, but that was the most impacted in 2020.
so the deep impacts were concentrated in the second quarter, right at the beginning of the pandemic and we've seen steady recovery ever since then and that continues today. but any change in that trend and that's the aftershock question could obviously be impactful to our results. so again, all of that kind of adds up the reason to be cautiously optimistic about recovery in the path ahead. and as we noted earlier on the call, we would expect to have more clarity by the time our first quarter call comes around, we'll certainly have the heating season behind us, always a big quarter for us and that should put us in a position to tighten up our outlook on covid.
richard sunderland -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color there. i'll leave it at that one. thanks.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
all right, thank you, richard. have a good day.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. go ahead please. your line is open.
kody clark -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, it's actually kody clark on for shar, good morning.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
kody clark -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
so maybe starting you have projects announced for $1.25 billion in capex, but you continue to point to a range of remaining investment for solar of $200 million. i'm just wondering why you wouldn't narrow it, why keep that range if you're kind of zeroing in on the remaining projects. and then just wondering when we might get an update on some of those projects?
shawn anderson -- chief strategy & risk officer
good morning, thanks for the question. appreciate that. at this point, we continue to track toward that $1.8 billion to $2 billion range. that range is really born out of the rfp process and as we start to commercialize, we're a step closer to the ending projects that we think will fill out the balance of need. we'll be able to tighten that. but at this point, there is no indication that it's any different than $1.8 billion to $2 billion. but we do expect to have additional announcements yet here in first quarter that relate to that $1.8 billion to $2 billion.
kody clark -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it, ok. thank you. and then if i could, i was just wondering if you've given any more thought to portfolio optimization and how you could use it to offset some of your equity needs related to renewables. do you think -- you still have some room to reiterate on valuation before you can get comfortable with looking at a sale?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's something we certainly continue to watch, both our stock price as well as transactions that have been announced as well as are in the market now trying to understand how that might provide value above our plan. again, the finance and we've outlined is inclusive or the earnings we've outlined is inclusive of the financing that we've talked about, but we'll continue to look and see if there strategic options that makes sense long term and would enhance our growth over the 2021 to 2024 time period.
kody clark -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
awesome. right. that's all i had. thanks so much.

our next question comes from the line of charles fishman with morningstar. go ahead please. your line is open.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i know this was asked, but i'm still confused and afraid, on '21 capex, the range is about $100 million to $200 million lower than the analyst day as well as 3q. and what was the -- what is the reason for that? if you could maybe talk about that again?
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, we really just gave a wide range to incorporate all of the years -- all the individual years in the plan. and certainly a growth over time, because of -- as our capital in the modernization programs go -- grow but also the renewable investments. and feel this first year is really kind of that first year of growth that builds into that long range or that the range that we provided over investor day. and again it's aligned with the guidance that we provided for this year and long-term.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay.
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
the other way to think about is, last year we spent about $1.7 billion, the midpoint of our guidance for this year is $2 billion. so significant increase and that's what we've been doing historically is kind of building each year, building our capabilities, making sure we've got construction crews and internal capabilities to execute that program.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and then moving to slide 15 you pulled out transmission project as a separate line item $150 million. i guess it sounds like that's associated one of the forward wind projects. is that what's regulated [phonetic].
shawn anderson -- chief strategy & risk officer
no, that would be indiana rate base investments. and it's really to support the shutdown of the shahfer plants.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, got it. and then one final question, you've talked about gas customer -- i didn't write that down. i think it was 30,000 last year. just on a -- any jurisdiction that you're seeing faster growth than the other ones or is it just spread out, is it coming from propane converts [indecipherable] any color you can add?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, charles. it's actually strong across the board. we've seen just below 1% at the low end and close to 2% at the high end. and virginia is the strong, the leader in terms of the growth rate of customer additions. some of that is actual growth in the economy there, new housing starts and new construction, that's always a differentiator for us. but across the board, you hit it. you see some propane conversion, some oil conversion, even at the edges is now, those numbers that we shared net out the massachusetts contribution. so you should think about that 30,000 across the six states of nisource's now. so pretty balanced strong 1 percentage growth across the board and our outlook remains strong on that too, we see continued demand.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
and then when there is a new home being built in your jurisdictions and gas is available are you being down given the home versus all electric?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, typically, that's a strong preference and it's what the builders in particular, it's typically an established relationship that drives that choice.
charles fishman -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, that's all i had. thanks very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q4 2020 nisource earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, randy hulen, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
randy hulen -- vice president, investor relations and treasurer
thank you and welcome everyone to the nisource fourth quarter 2020 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, our chief executive officer; donald brown, our chief financial officer; and shawn anderson, our chief strategy and risk officer.
the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.
before turning the call over to joe, donald and shawn, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factor sections of our periodic sec filings.
additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.
with all that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, randy. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our fourth quarter and full year earnings release which we issued earlier today. 2020 was a year like no other. despite the challenges of a historic global pandemic the nisource team remained focused on our core mission of providing safe, reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve, while at the same time enhancing our position to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities.
our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business and continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our transition away from coal generation. in indiana, we completed two wind power projects in december and we continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
let's turn now to slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. in 2020, we delivered non-gaap net operating earnings of $1.32 per share as our cost management and regulatory mitigation efforts reduced the financial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition to some i've mentioned already, we achieved a number of other key milestones in 2020. we invested $1.7 billion in our gas and electric utilities, primarily on safety and asset modernization, which remains the top priority. we advanced and matured our safety management system and safety enhancement initiatives and 70% of our low pressure systems are now protected with automatic shutoff devices and remote monitoring. we launched our transformative nisource next initiative to support our safety initiatives, build organizational capabilities and enhance our efficiency. we sold the columbia gas of massachusetts business completing the transaction in eight months. we lowered the weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt by 60 basis points and enhanced our liquidity through the covid-19 pandemic. and we continue to see strong demand for natural gas, experiencing a net gain of more than 30,000 gas customers across our six state footprint.
we are today reaffirming our 2021 non-gaap net operating earnings guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 per share. consistent with the long-term growth plan we provided at investor day, we expect to make $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth safety and asset modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, and $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments through 2023. i will note that we do expect an order in our pennsylvania base rate case in the first quarter with rate that would be retroactive to january 23.
now i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our 2020 financial performance in more detail.
donald brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, joe, and good morning everyone. looking at our 2020 results on slide 4, we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $508 million or $1.32 per share compared to non-gaap net operating earnings of about $495 million or $1.32 per share in 2019. i would note the loss of fourth quarter earnings related to the sale of cma, reduced 2020 non-gaap earnings per share by approximately $0.05.
looking more closely at our segment, 12 months non-gaap results on slide 5. operating earnings were up about $36 million for the year in our gas segment. operating revenues net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $19 million due to the sale of cma, partially offset by infrastructure program revenues and increased customer growth. operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $55 million, mostly due to the cma sale and lower employee and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased covid related costs.
in our electric segment 12 months non-gaap operating earnings were down by nearly $40 million, driven primarily by an approximately $16 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to new rates from the recent rate case, partially offset by covid related impact from customer usage, late payment fees and reconnection fees. operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up by approximately $55 million due to the increased depreciation expenses.
turning to slide 6. we provide additional details about the financial impacts of covid-19. as you can see, we're seeing lower commercial and industrial sales, which are partially offset by increased residential sales. we're also seeing reduced late payment and reconnection fees as well as higher bad debt and other expenses. the total growth impact of covid-19 in 2020 was approximately $0.10 per share. this impact was partially offset by non-safety-related cost management and regulatory solutions, bringing the net 2020 impact of covid-19 to approximately $0.05 per share. consistent with our base case, we currently expect an additional covid impact in 2021 of approximately $0.05 per share, which is factored into our 2021 non-gaap eps guidance range. while we're monitoring the pandemic closely, to date, it has not presented significant barriers to our safety and infrastructure modernization program or our long-term growth. as joe mentioned, we are reaffirming both our 2021 earnings guidance and the guidance for long-term capex and eps cagr that we outlined at investor day.
now turning to slide 7. i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our debt level as of december 31 was about $9.7 billion of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. following the successful liability management transaction in the third quarter, the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 15 years and weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. at the end of the fourth quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. our credit ratings from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments.
let's take a quick look at slide 9, which highlights our current financing plan. i would just note that we continue to look at ways to optimize the financing of our growth strategy. we are currently evaluating scenarios utilizing hybrids and/or convertibles that get 50% or more equity credit with the rating agencies and could minimize the need for block equity offering in 2022 or 2023. we would anticipate a hybrid or convertible offering some time in the first half of 2021. i would also note the next week we plan to file a new at-the-market or atm equity program to satisfy our atm needs for the next three years. just to remind everyone, our guidance is inclusive of this financing plan.
now i'd like to turn the call back over to joe who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric businesses.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now let's take a look at some nisource utilities highlights for the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2021. starting with our gas operations on slide 10. in pennsylvania, our base rate case remains pending before the public utility commission. the application originally filed in april 2020 was modified in december and now seeks an annual revenue increase of $76.8 million to invest in modernize and upgrade our existing natural gas distribution system as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. an order is expected in the first quarter of 2021 with new rates expected to become effective retroactive to january 23, 2021.
in maryland, the public service commission approved the settlement in our base rate request in november 2020. the approved settlement supports further upgrading and replacement of our pipelines and is expected to increase annual revenue by $3.3 million, including $1.3 million of current tracker revenue. new rates became effective in december 2020.
in indiana, our latest tracker update was approved in december in our long-term gas infrastructure modernization program. the update covers $26 million in incremental capital invested under the program between january and june of 2020. a new rates became effective in january of 2021. the indiana utility regulatory commission in 2020 approved a six-year extension of the program, including nearly $950 million in planned capital investments through 2025 to be recovered through semiannual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or tdsic tracker.
now let's look at our electric operations on slide 11. in january, the indiana utility regulatory commission approved the latest tracker update request in our long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan. the approved electric tdsic tracker update covers more than $122 million in incremental capital investment made between july 2019 and june 2020. the new rates became effective this month. this well established program includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further enhance safety and reliability. the program originally approved by the iurc in 2016 includes approximately $1.2 billion in electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022.
and now, i'll ask shawn anderson to provide an update about our renewable generation projects.
shawn anderson -- chief strategy & risk officer
thank you, joe. as joe shared earlier, we completed our first two wind projects, rosewater and jordan creek on time in december, which is an exciting milestone in executing our generation transition. rosewater is a joint venture with edp renewables, north america and our tax equity partner, wells fargo. jordan creek represents a power purchase agreement or ppa with nextera energy resources. these completed projects are now powering more than 125,000 homes across indiana with cleaner, more cost-effective energy. our third wind project, indiana crossroads remains under construction. this joint venture with edp is expected to be in service at the end of this year. these renewable projects are consistent with our 2018 integrated resource plan, within which the preferred pathway plans to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all by lower cost reliable and cleaner options. the plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years.
as joe noted earlier, we continue to expect to make $1.8 billion to $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. to date, we have executed agreements representing approximately $1.25 billion of this anticipated investment. commercial negotiations for additional solar and storage capacity continue to advance. half of the capacity in the replacement plan is targeted to be owned by joint ventures that will include nipsco and tax equity partners as the members. the balance of new capacity is expected to be primarily in the form of ppas.
in november 2020, we filed applications with the iurc for the approval of the dunns bridge i and ii and cavalry solar energy centers. these 3 indiana projects are build transfer agreements with nextera energy resources and represent a combined capital investment of approximately $850 million for nipsco. these projects are expected to be placed into service across 2022 and 2023. nextera are going to form joint ventures with tax equity investors to own, operate and maintain these assets and iurc order is expected in the second quarter of 2021. we continue to fill out the balance of our capacity. in january the iurc approved our brickyard and greensboro solar and storage ppas.
nextera energy resources will develop these projects which are expected to be completed in mid-2023 and in december 2020 nipsco announced the long-term ppa with the clean energy infrastructure business of capital dynamics to develop gibson solar, a 280 megawatt solar project in gibson county, indiana. nipsco filed an application with the iurc for approval of this project in january 2021. construction is expected to begin in 2022 with commercial operations to begin in 2023. also in december of 2020, nipsco filed an application with the iurc for approval of the green river solar ppa. advanced [phonetic] negotiations continue for additional build transfer agreement to fill out the remainder of our capacity needs. we expect those negotiations to be completed in the first half of 2021 and the necessary regulatory filings coming shortly thereafter.
in the fourth quarter of 2021, nipsco will be submitting an integrated resource plan to the iurc that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans, including the planned retirement of michigan city generating station. the preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 irp could create additional capital investment opportunity.
before we move on from our electric story, i would like to provide a quick update on units 14 and 15 at our shahfer generating station. as you know, all four coal units at shahfer plan to retire by may 2023 as outlined in the 2018 irp. as we continue to evaluate the economics of our generating fleet and the ongoing costs and investments required to keep the coal units operational, we determined that the right path forward for us is to initiate the retirement of two of the four coal units at shahfer. units 14 and 15 will retire by the end of 2021, which is the most economic decision for our customers. nipsco's remaining fleet, renewable capacity and secured capacity purchases will continue to reliably serve the energy needs to our customers. to be clear, our earnings guidance is not impacted by this decision. we are excited about the significant progress in executing the plan we identified in our 2018 irp and further detailed at our investor day, and we look forward to more projects and updates to come in future quarters.
now i will turn the call back over to joe.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shawn. let's turn back to our foundational commitment, safety. as i noted earlier, our safety enhancement initiatives advanced and matured in 2020. our implementation of apis, safety management system or sms transitioned from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within nisource, and we expanded the implementation to our electric business. with the ongoing support and advice from the independent quality review board, we are continuing to mature our sms processes, capabilities and talent and we're collaborating with our industry peers to enhance safety and reduce operational risk.
we had a number of safety milestones in 2020 that are worth calling out: we launched mobile gas leak detection pilot project and implemented a service line mapping strategy to enhance records quality across our footprint; we added special clearance processes and other layers of protection to critical field operations activities; our gas meter shops and our fabrication facility earned iso 9001 certification, a strong first step in a continuing quality effort; and the final safety recommendation around emergency preparedness and response was closed by the national transportation safety board, our emergency response processes. as noted, sms has become our core operating model build on our culture of empowering everyone to report and identify risk, including the authority to stop work whenever necessary. enhancing process safety with layers of protection and building accountability for effective asset management to reduce risk. you'll see additional enhancements through our safety plan in 2021.
i'm also pleased to note some recognition that nisource received in mid-november when we were named to the dow jones sustainability north america index for the seventh consecutive year. nisource is one of seven us utilities on the 2020 list [phonetic]. the ranking is based on environmental, social and governance criteria and reflects our progress on our sustainability strategy, which includes an aggressive greenhouse gas reductions, safety enhancement and executing against $40 billion of long-term safety, asset modernization and renewable energy investment opportunities. we're honored to once again be included on this international benchmark for sustainable business practices, which recognizes the comprehensive focus on esg principles at the core of how we run our business.
before turning to the q&a portion of today's call, i'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. our 2020 financial and operational results reflect the resiliency of our business and our team as we executed on our safety and asset modernization programs, our electric generation transition strategy, reliably served customers through the historic covid pandemic and took steps to reposition the company to execute on significant long-term growth opportunities.
we continue to expect to deliver non-gaap net operating earnings per share in the range of a $1.28 to $1.36 in 2021. our long-term growth commitments remain in place. these include $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in annual growth safety and modernization investments from 2021 through 2024, plus $1.8 billion to $2 billion in renewable generation investments across 2022 and 2023. and compound annual earnings-per-share growth of 7% to 9% from 2021 through 2024, with near term growth to 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2023. our electric generation strategy continues to advance with our first two wind projects complete, and numerous other renewable projects in development.
thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of nisource. we're now ready to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question is from the line of shahriar pourreza of guggenheim.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
hey. good morning, shar.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
so, just a couple quick questions here, joe and donald. so, obviously, the block equity needs are solved but maybe curious how you're sort of thinking about further asset optimization, especially with some of the healthier prints we've seen with centerpoint and duke. i guess, joe, do you see value maybe to further simplify your jurisdictional footprint, maybe shrink your balance sheet, shut off the atms and internal programs, and take some incremental dry powder especially as we're seeing additional opportunities on the renewable side ramp up over the next few years? further of a strategic start question.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. thanks, shar. and as we've said consistently, we're always exploring opportunities to drive and sustain long-term shareholder value. that's really the underpinning of the question. and options for shaping our footprint and our business mix are a key part of that. and we objectively and thoroughly evaluate those on an ongoing basis. the key backdrop for us is the current plan that has 10% or higher rate base growth in each of our utility companies. and that comprises the $40 billion of identified investments over 20 years that i think is uniquely well balanced and supported by constructive regulatory mechanisms and policy environments across our jurisdiction.
so, that all adds up to a strong hand with options and time to ensure any moves that we might make truly enhance value on a risk-adjusted basis. so, very open minded, very deliberate and thoughtful about that and as we work through particularly this year, our electric irp as we've talked about today and we refine other long-range investment plans particularly beyond 2023, it's pretty clear plan out through '23. these options will all remain on the table. we'll continue to look at those opportunities. and then on the point about ldc values, we're all seeing that ldc value indicators in the private markets appear to be really strong and either more aligned with the fundamentals and the sustainable growth that we see in the business.
and so, i think it's important to take that as an input that kind of cuts both ways and then maybe even extending that perspective just a bit in a clean energy transition supporting a modern high-tech economy. it's more important that we solve for and plan for secure, reliable, resilient energy systems. and we think the natural gas system has a key role in that transition. so, we're looking at all of that with a long-term shareholder value perspective. and it'll always be an alternative to traditional financing as you noted.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
and let me add joe, i'd say if you look at the financing we've done, it really does put us in a place of having more flexibility because it firmly puts this in our target range of 14% to 15% episode of debt, which gives us some flexibility really think strategically about how we grow the business. and certainly, as we continue to look at the long-term plan, we'll look at portfolio, but we'll also look at what are those growth opportunities in our business, and the timing of the growth investments and how we finance those.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
terrific. thanks, donald. and then, just on sort of the uptick in renewable spend get to see that there. and obviously, you guys highlighted there could be incremental spend coming from the new irp. can you just remind us if the incremental spend that can come about is that sort of embedded in your current trajectory as we think about rate base growth or earnings especially as you guys extend through '24, right, or potential new opportunities that come about from the irp potentially accretive to the -- to how you guys currently guide? so, extend the runway or accretive and assuming that you guys are embedding a 50/50 ppa versus jv structure on any new opportunities anyway it appears.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yeah. if we think about the -- if you're referring to the new irp that we just entered into that's really going to look at opportunities and what that generation strategy is post-2024, so michigan city replacement opportunities. so, it'll be an extension of that. and so, we'll get through that by the end of the year. that will provide some insight in terms of what that portfolio would look like beyond 2024 and potentially provide some insight on what investment opportunities there might be for us.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and so, just to bring that back around, the $2 billion we talked about today is all included in the growth rate guidance that we reaffirmed today. and i'd note that just this morning, even as we speak, the indiana commission approved three more renewable projects and another ppa, so really four projects like those being the dunns bridge project and the cavalry project. so, with those now approved, approximately two-thirds of the $2 billion that we've talked about is already approved by the commission.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
terrific. thank you, guys. great execution. appreciate it.

joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, charles.
operator
charles, your phone is muted, please unmute.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
i'm sorry. joe, you said that you had more certainty with respect to regulatory outlook and you just had a decision or recently had a decision in pennsylvania. is that what you base that statement on? is it because you have a roe in that decision where you had a settlement the time before or is there any more color you can provide to that statement you made?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yes. thanks, charles. good to hear from you this morning. that's a big part of the '21 regulatory agenda but also a number of our trackers are already approved. so we're well through the regulatory calendar for 2021. and so that total picture is the basis for the revision to our guidance.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then if i could just ask just a couple housekeeping things probably for donald. on the guidance now, when we say the 7% to 9% on top of '21 guidance, is that the original guidance of $1.28 to $1.36 or the revised guidance this morning?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
it would be the revised guidance, the narrowed guidance.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
the growth is off the narrowed guidance?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
that's right.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then, i certainly had a discussion with randy and chris on the equity units. but just i guess a question i forgot to ask them is, if you're willing to answer or giving an answer to this. can you give us any guide at the weighted average shares in '21?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
weighted average shares in '21.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
yeah. that's for your eps.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
have patience. i don't know if randy -- if you've got -- why don't we follow up with you?
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
oh, that's fine. that's just a modeling question. thank you. thank you. that's all i had.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
if i can insert just a second. if you just take where we ended 2020, charles which was about $392 million and you assume the equity units and even the price they were issued at $24.51 that would be approximately $35 million additional shares. but of course, you'd only take seven-twelfths of that if you will from a weighted average standpoint. and then of course then you would add in an assumption around the atm which we've guided toward $200 million to $300 million and divide it by a price perhaps $24 or $25 you get about $12 million additional shares there. but usually, we settle on those shares in december so they won't have a huge impact from a weighted average standpoint. but that should give you a good indication for modeling on where the share count is.
charles fishman -- morningstar, inc. -- analyst
fantastic. that's exactly what i needed. thank you.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer

julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lync -- analyst
hey. good morning, team. thanks for the time and opportunity to connect here.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
hey. morning, julian.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
good morning.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lync -- analyst
thank you. hey, perhaps if i could follow up on charles question a little bit here. you talk about being more front footed and thinking strategically here after raising the latest liquidity and improving your metrics. can you elaborate what those criteria might be or how are you thinking about things? i mean, is it about having a certain critical mass in certain states? is it about being weighted electric versus gas or are there other factors? i just want to -- if you don't mind elaborating a little bit.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yeah. sure. i mean it goes back to risk-adjusted growth prospects and strong balance sheet for the cash generation. but among the factors that you mentioned, business mix, and i would characterize the scale and the jurisdiction as one of those factors as well. all of those things go into the way we look at the portfolio. and we'll continue to look at those as we go forward. but you put in front of that the $40 billion of identified investment and the growth rate that's driven off of the current footprint. and then it's really that's kind of your base case for evaluation of strategic alternatives.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lync -- analyst
excellent. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question is from the line of richard sunderland of j.p. morgan.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan securities llc -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. maybe just starting off with the narrow guidance range. what are your covid assumptions baked into that over the balance of the year and realized on the quarter?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes. thanks for the question. so, for the quarter, overall, covid did not have a material impact on us. really had some offsetting items in terms of higher residential sales offsetting continued lower sales from our small commercial and some industrial. and so as we think -- so, what we've done is we removed that $0.05 that we had in our guidance with the expectation that it's not going to be material for the balance of this year. certainly, we've got some risk from a bad debt expense. but even with that, we think that won't be material for us for the balance of this year.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan securities llc -- analyst
got it. that's very clear. and then just turning back to the optimization discussion. i can appreciate that the financing strategy has been derisked materially falling to equity units. but just curious as a financing tool specifically how you view that as a piece of the toolset meaning you removed these discrete equity needs for the renewables through 2024. so, does that kind of push out the financing driven timing of any elements there or is it may be tied to that longer term look around the 2021 irp that we should be getting later this year? i know it's kind of a specific angle here but curious for any thoughts.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yeah. certainly, as joe talked about, we're always evaluating the plan and there's quote in each of our operating companies so we'll continue to do that. as we look at portfolio, that's an ongoing analysis as we look at what's the best alternative to finance the plan. so, i would not say that we have to wait for any other catalysts in terms of our business plan changing including that irp. it's something that we'll continue to use the data points from those transactions and others to update our analysis. and if it makes sense to do something with portfolio, we would absolutely do that. again, it's always against evaluating our plan with significant growth 8% to 10% or 10% to 12% rate base growth in all of our businesses and financing that in the most effective way.
richard sunderland -- j.p. morgan securities llc -- analyst
great. thank you for the color there.

[operator instructions] and your next question is from the line of david peter [phonetic] [indecipherable] research.
david peter -- research -- analyst
yeah. hey. good morning, guys.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
morning.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
morning, david.
david peter -- research -- analyst
just on the tdsic filing in indiana in june. i guess what prompted the termination of the old program and i guess what should we sort of expect kind of in this new filing? is it more of the same?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yeah. for the tdsic program, yeah, there's opportunity driven off of the legislation from a couple of years ago to enhance the investment mix in a tdsic filing. so that's certainly one of the opportunities we'll be looking at. in the areas of grid modernization even technology footprint, all of those are in the mix of consideration for the next plan. and then, you also have an interplay between your tdsic timing and your rate cases. so, that's another driver of the timing for this filing.
david peter -- research -- analyst
great. and then, the second question just with respect to potential legislation out there at the federal level. if you were to see some form of direct payment for ptcs or itcs come across, have you looked at how that might impact your renewable strategy current or future projects just given that you guys are using a good amount of tax equity?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's something we're paying attention to. there's not a lot of detail yet on how that might happen, and from the timing of where we are in our plan, how to impact that plan. so, i think current expectations our plan won't change, but certainly direct payments could provide some upside. but we've got to get more information on what that means. and again, it's also based upon the timing of that legislation with our financing of our current projects.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
and then, strategically, longer term, while we're on that topic of the tax credits, we like to see that concept expanded to support renewable natural gas and/or hydrogen because in the clean energy transition there's not only a room for but a need for alternative energy across the spectrum. so, we think there's an opportunity there as well.
david peter -- research -- analyst
great. that's it for me. thanks, guys.

good day and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q1 2021 nisource earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand today's conference over to your speaker for today, randy hulen, vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
randy hulen -- vice president, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nisource first quarter 2021 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, our chief executive officer; donald brown, our chief financial officer; and shawn anderson, our chief strategy and risk officer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the first quarter of 2021 as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. before turning the call over to joe, donald and shawn, just a quick reminder.
some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.
with all that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, randy. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us. hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our first quarter earnings release which we issued earlier today. with the successful completion of last month's convertible issuance, nisource is well-positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan, driven by safety and asset modernization programs, as well as our electric generation transmission strategy. in indiana, we kicked off our 2021 integrated resource plan process, which will inform our strategy beyond 2023 and we initiated four new renewable energy projects.
we continue to expect that our infrastructure and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from the midpoint of our narrowed 2021 guidance through 2024. we also expect to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030. let's turn now to slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. in the first quarter, we delivered non-gaap diluted net operating earnings of $0.77 per share. these results include increased earnings from our safety and modernization investments and reflect the profile of our business without columbia gas of massachusetts.
as you saw in our release, today we narrowed our 2021 non-gaap diluted net operating earnings guidance to a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous range. this narrowed range reflects lower than previously expected covid impacts and more certainty with regulatory outcomes offset by slightly higher diluted share count resulting from the equity unit issuance. we expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. these include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. in addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period.
as we outlined at our 2020 investor day, nisource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. columbia gas of pennsylvania received an order in its 2020 rate case and it has filed a new rate case to support its safety and modernization plans, which i will discuss in more detail later in this call. in addition, we have continued to successfully execute on our renewable energy strategy adding four new renewable energy projects as part of our your energy, your future initiative.
now i'd like to turn the call over to donald who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in more detail.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thanks, joe and good morning, everyone. looking at our first quarter 2021 results in slide 4, we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $305 million or $0.77 per diluted share compared to non-gaap net operating earnings of about $291 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020. i would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to columbia gas of massachusetts or cma due to the sale closing in october of 2020. looking more closely at our segment three-month non-gaap results on slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $374 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $18 million versus last year.
operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down about $84 million due to the sale of cma, partially offset by increased infrastructure program revenues and customer growth. operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $66 million, mostly due to the cma sale and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. in our electric segment, three-month non-gaap operating earnings were about $91 million, which was approximately $11 million higher than the first quarter of 2020.
this increase was driven primarily by an approximately $9 million increase in operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage. operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were slightly lower due to environmental and employee-related cost. now, turning to slide 6, i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our debt level as of march 31 was about $9.8 billion, of which about $9.1 billion was long-term debt. the weighted average maturity in our long-term debt was approximately 15 years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%.
at the end of the first quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.9 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization program. our credit rating from all three major rating agencies are investment grade and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings. taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to support our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. let's take a quick look at slide 8, which highlights our updated financing plan. i would just note that following last month's equity unit issuance, we no longer expect to issue block or discrete equity through 2024. this issuance that received 100% equity credit from all three agencies allows nisource to capture share price upside and provide timely proceeds for our renewable investment. most importantly, this issuance significantly de-risks our financing plans and is consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments.
now, i'd like to turn the call back over to joe, who will provide some infrastructure investment and regulatory updates for our gas and electric business.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now, let's look at some nisource utilities highlights for the first quarter of 2021 starting with our gas operations on slide 9. in pennsylvania, the public utility commission approved an annual revenue increase of $63.5 million in the rate case we filed in 2020. this reflects our investments to modernize and upgrade our natural gas distribution system, as well as maintain the continued safety of the system. the commission also approved an roe of 9.86% with rates effective as of january 23 of this year. in addition, the company filed another base rate case in march to support its ongoing safety and modernization program.
in kentucky, we received an order on april 30 from the public service commission in our safety modification and replacement program tracker filing. this order approves $40 million in upgrades and replacements under way in 2021 and $2.6 million of incremental revenue. in indiana, nipsco continues its long-term gas modernization program. nearly $950 million in capital investments are planned through 2025 to be recovered through semi-annual adjustments to the existing gas transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or tdsic tracker. rates approved in our 2020 filing became effective in january of this year. in virginia, we implemented rates approved in our 2020 steps to advance virginia energy or save tracker filing.
now let's look at our electric operations on slide 10. nipsco has filed notice to terminate its current electric transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge or tdsic plan. we expect to file a new five-year plan on or soon after june 1. the updated plan will include newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers, as well as some previously identified projects. as mentioned earlier, we have begun our 2021 integrated resource plan or irp process. similar to our 2018 irp, the process will include an rfp for new resources. we plan to receive input from customers in a wide variety of other stakeholders throughout the year and expect to submit our plan to the indiana utility regulatory commission by november.
i would now like to ask shawn to provide more on the significance of the irp and an update about our renewable generation projects.
shawn anderson -- chief strategy & risk officer
thank you, joe. we continue to make strong progress on our renewable generation transition. in total, we have announced 14 renewable projects which will likely fill the balance of capacity necessary to replace the retiring units at our schahfer generating station, which continues to track for retirement by may 2023. four new projects have been announced in 2021. they include two projects with edp renewables, indiana crossroads solar park, which is a build-transfer agreement and is expected to enter service in 2022. and indiana crossroads ii which is a wind project announced as a power purchase agreement or ppa and is expected to enter service in 2023.
we also announced fairbanks solar, a build-transfer agreement with invenergy for a 250-megawatt project expected to be online in 2023. and finally, we signed a build-transfer agreement with capital dynamics for a 200-megawatt project expected to be operational in 2023 named elliot solar. we've already begun the regulatory approval process for these projects. upcoming shortly in the second quarter of 2021 we expect an order from the iurc on four previously filed projects our dunns bridge i and ii, cavalry solar energy center and green river solar projects.
all of these updates continue to track on time to retire nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation by 2023 and retire all coal generation by 2028 to be replaced by lower cost, reliable and cleaner options. the plan is expected to drive a 90% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is expected to save our electric customers an estimated $4 billion over 30 years. the executed agreements we've announced are also within budget, representing approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments. the projects these agreements support represent nipsco's investment interest in the replacement capacity which equates to approximately half of the total capacity needed.
the remaining new capacity is in the form of power purchase agreements. finally, as joe has highlighted, in the fourth quarter of 2021, nipsco plans to submit a new integrated resource plan to the iurc that will continue to outline its long-term generation plans including the planned retirement of michigan city generating station. the preferred plan that emerges from the 2021 irp could create additional capital investment opportunities. we are excited about the significant progress in executing our plan and we look forward to more updates in the future quarters.
now, i'd like to turn the call back over to joe.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shawn. i'd like to turn to our foundational commitment; safety. our safety management system, sms, is an established operating model within nisource. recent advances in sms include expanded quality management and achieving gold shovel standard certification. we are continuously enhancing process safety capabilities and ensuring effective asset management to reduce risks. i'd also like to note that we've begun a third-party validation of our sms implementation and we are working toward accreditation in 2022.
before turning to the q&a portion of today's call, i'll share and reiterate a few key takeaways. with last month's convertible issuance, nisource is well positioned to execute the next stage of our growth plan driven by continued execution of our safety and asset modernization programs as well as our electric generation transition strategy. we are narrowing our 2021 non-gaap deluded net operating earnings guidance to $1.32 to $1.36 per share, which represents the upper half of the previous guidance.
we expect to make approximately $10 billion in capital investments through 2024. these include annual investments of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in growth, safety and modernization programs. in addition, our investments in renewable generation are now expected to total approximately $2 billion over this period. as we outlined at our 2020 investor day, nisource continues to expect to grow its deluded net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024 including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023. in addition, we now have a total of 14 renewable energy projects as part of our your energy, your future initiative.
thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of nisource. we're now ready to take your questions.

thankyou, good morning. my first question is on, i think, the topic of the potential asset monetization that we have been talking about the past few months. it seems like just on the slides that language is no longer on there. just wanted to get your color and latest thoughts on any potential for that in your planning period. and whether in the near term, it's just that given the equity units and other funding that's already planned for the base capex, whether there is no immediate fee to raise that type of cash for other capex?
donald eugene brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. good morning, thanks for joining us. you should not read anything into that slide update. we remain focused on long term shareholder value. that hasn't changed. and we're evaluating market conditions and our portfolio as an ongoing part of that process. and so though it's related to the financing, as you noted, we continue to view any asset sale as primarily a strategic decision based on long term shareholder value, more than as a way to satisfy any near term financing needs. and that's really, i mean, we've stated it over and over, that's underpinned by our plan that drives 7% to 9% long term growth, inclusive of all financing in the current planning horizon and without any asset sales. so clearly, a strategic shift would need to enhance what's already a strong plan. that said, given our exceptionally large known capex cycle and potential future investment opportunities that will unfold as we go forward and continued modest equity funding needs that go along with that, meaning our atm program, shouldn't be surprising that we're not taking those options off the table. just because it's not on a slide, doesn't mean it's not continuing to be on the table. and those factors can converge with strategic alternatives at any point in time. so i appreciate the question.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that makes a lot of sense. my other question is just on the electric demand growth that you've seen this quarter and year to date in indiana. it seems like a pretty robust rebound, especially in the commercial and industrials. how does that trend compare versus your expectations, i guess, earlier in the year? and are you seeing momentum that's continuing as we head into the second half?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'll take that. i think what you're seeing on the c&i sales and electric business really is the impact of covid last year in the second quarter. that second quarter where you had the businesses shut down and certainly, our largest customers shut down operations, had the biggest financial impact on us in that second quarter. so that's the recovery, what you're seeing. and it's certainly, as we expected and what we planned for. so very good outcome. and i'd say on the smaller commercial, we're continuing to see a recovery there. again, that's expected in part of our plan, and we'll continue to monitor and manage that.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and just going forward, i guess, when things, when we think about normal low growth overall, what's the good roll-up from, type of level we should be thinking there?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. just on the electric side, taking out the industrial, the largest industrials, which is pretty stable. for the other customer classes, we're seeing in the 1% range, maybe a little less than 1%.
operator
our next question comes from the line of durgesh chopra from evercore isi.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
just on the 2021 irp, i'm just thinking about, first, can you confirm for us that any incremental capital spend coming out of that 2021 irp indiana that would be sort of above and beyond your current capex plan. am i thinking about this the right way?
donald eugene brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, that's right. i think you said that right, durgesh. anything we, that emerges from that, from the irp process would set up our planning cycle for next year and would allow us to roll forward our capex plan. but it's too early to predict how that will play out, given where we are in the irp.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's great. and then just thinking about, so you obviously had a lot of success in the 2018 irp, $2 billion in capex. should we think about the upside directionally? i mean, i guess, if i look to handicap capex opportunities, is the 2018 irp a sort of a good starting point to make that assessment?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i think it's a little too early to say that because the irp itself sets up the plan. there are other factors outside of the irp, notably miso's continuing evolution of capacity credits and how to think about that, the evolving picture through the rfp that we're running here. so i think of it as an envelope that you'll see when we file the irp, an envelope of opportunity. and all else being equal, our bias being to seek the investment opportunities that come through that plan. so we'll know a lot more as we get through the coming stages of the irp and then beyond that into the final stages of planning for the replacement of michigan city, which, the timing of which is also part of the question in the irp process.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and just one last one. just on the, in terms of timing, sort of your q4 call sets up pretty nicely with the filing of the irp. is that sort of, for us to kind of look at what your forward-looking plans are going to be and what you might be able to accomplish in this irp? is that a good sort of date for us to watch for an update from an irp perspective?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. just the overall time lines, the way they overlay. it'll be our q3 call, we'll be pretty close to the timing of the filing of the irp. so there'll be plenty to talk about there. that will be a little early to roll forward our capex plan because there's a lot of other parts of the business that go into the ultimate long-range plan. and our business planning cycle, we'll push that out to first half of next year sometime before we'd likely be in a position to extend capex and growth rate guidance.
operator
our next question comes from the line of david peters from wolfe research.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
a couple of questions for me. yes. just first, nice to see that you have the cpcns for all the jv projects. and obviously, i know third parties are developing those. but just wondering, are they all currently on schedule and budget, just given some of the inflationary pressures and kind of supply chain bottlenecks we've seen in the market? have you guys seen any project, any impact to your projects?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
this is shawn. i'll take that question. yes is the answer to your question, everything remains on time, on schedule, on budget. we're confident in that schedule. we're in constant communication with our developers and everything continues to track, including even one project, which we expect to be concluding construction here in fourth quarter of 2021. so much to look forward to as we sequence through that.
david peters -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then the other one, just on the atm, can you guys share how much you have done year to date within your $200 million, $300 million target?
donald eugene brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. we have satisfied this year's equity need of $200 to $300, $200 million to $300 million. so we're pretty good this year. certainly, as we've outlined, it's $200 million to $300 million annually through 2022, and then we expect in 2023, up to $150 million of atm.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of travis miller from morningstar.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
thinking back to that, and i read one of the questions about capex. as you've gone through the early stages here of replacing coal with new renewables and thinking about your target out to 2028 and 2030, what does that trajectory look like in terms of more renewables that will be needed, right? if you get the sense of my question. have you learned kind of what the investment need is relative to retiring coal plants and what that trajectory would look like?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
this is shawn. so to take you back to the 2018 preferred plan, it did, as you noted, have the retirement of michigan city by 2028 with the replacement solution at that time pointing toward renewables. and so then you step into the current time where we're at with the 2021 irp, we're putting all those assumptions back in to reevaluate to ensure that, that continues to path or if there's any changes. and joe highlighted some of those as you think about miso's changes or resource adequacy requirements, how that factors in into the blend of components that produce a plan, an integrated resource plan with the reliability that's necessary as well as the affordability that's necessary, the compliance that's necessary and all the other factors that you would use to measure an entire fleet and entire portfolio. so the current plan is still that plan, which would be the retirement of michigan city by 2028 with the replacement of renewables. and then the rfp process that we just stepped through helps to inform the actionable bids or technology and portfolio solutions that could come online to help support that build out. and as you know, we did an all source rfp, which allows other technology to come in and compete. and then we can evaluate all those different factors back within the context of the irp itself and then the affordability as well as the reliability and compliance, etc.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. so then the run rate that you've been looking at just in terms of dollars, nothing material that you've learned new since the last two, three years going through that whole, coal retirement, replacing with renewables? is that what i'm kind of thinking about?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
that's accurate. yes. the existing plan would still be the plan of reference. and i'd point you maybe toward the september stakeholder meeting within the context of the irp itself. that will help to inform more of the existing fleet analysis, which speaks more to the timing question related to michigan city or the retirement of existing assets as well as understanding how the replacement technology could sequence in to support that.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ryan levine from citi.
ryan levine -- citi -- analyst
this might be for shawn. what level of transparency do you have in the status of the solar development, the solar projects development given the third party nature? and given the supply chain challenges, could it be in nisource's interest to encourage the delay of some of these projects?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
appreciate it. ryan, as i said, we regularly speak with our developers, and we have ongoing dialogue and discussion with our developers to ensure that we remain part of the dialogue through the process. of course, when those projects operationalize, that takes a significant amount of work on our team's side as well. and so there's constant communication to ensure that we're pacing alongside one another. our counterparties have track records of being on time and on budget. this, combined with the long lead time of the contracts themselves, give us the confidence that these projects continue to path.
ryan levine -- citi -- analyst
to the extent that there were price escalations or bottlenecks in the logistics of delivery, could that conversation take place that would encourage nisource to push these projects to be delayed, given it may result in a better net outcome? or how do you think about the puts and takes that would underwrite such a decision?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
yes. it's a great question. and maybe i'd point you to the beginning of the process because we worked hard to build in contractual protections for our customers and our shareholders in the event of a delay. and we feel our developer partners are also strongly incentivized to execute on time and on budget. so we have multiple tools available to protect customers and shareholders from any delay. and we're confident in the discussions, the level of transparency as well as the construction timelines.
ryan levine -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then last question for me. in terms of the new technologies that are being proposed through the rfp. is there any that weren't being anticipated and may change the direction that you think the outcome could be in indiana?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
yes. great question. so we did receive two actionable proposals related to hydrogen. so not having a bias entering the process, using the rfp results themselves to give an indication of where market developments and technology developments have come together. we were interested and are interested to learn how those two proposals will stack up against all the other technology that we're probably more familiar with, as you can imagine. the fact that there were only really two actionable proposals might point to the nascency of the technology itself. but, so that's not necessarily all that surprising as there might need to be some more depth in the market to make those actionable. but we'll see. it's exciting to see that there's two on the horizon that could be actionable within our window. and we'll see what the results are as the third party starts to evaluate the quality of those bids and all the other components of the irp itself.
operator
[operator instructions] we have a follow-up question coming from the line of insoo kim from goldman sachs.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i guess i have one just on your, the latest thoughts on the safety management system program after implementing that and as the program continues to mature. how do you think about what the ultimate impact of those different actions and plans have on your operations? and maybe just financially, whether it's on o&m, is it, do we think about it, continue to add a constant layer of cost? or do some of those actions actually help reduce some of the costs going forward?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
no. yes. thanks, insoo, for that question, very insightful framing, too. we're at what i would call full implementation now of the sms framework across our business. and the way it's translating into the financial results that you pointed out are in a couple of different ways. it's broadening on a risk basis the portfolio of investments that we're making and ultimately that we're reflecting in our regulatory proceedings. and so think about the different asset classes, transmission pipe, distribution pipe, measurement regulation, even in our case, non jurisdictional programs beyond the meter. so that, we put all those side by side, evaluate the risk profile of each asset class and prioritize investments accordingly. that's a much more sophisticated model than has been the case historically. and so it's shifting the investment mix. and in some cases, we've seen the regulatory support for those follow along with tracker programs, for example, expanding to include differentiated programs. so it's been sort of a net broadening of the investment plan. and then from an o&m standpoint, it's, you've seen the o&m trajectory here. we're down, and it's actually driving efficiencies in some ways because of the nature of how the programs are designed. so the actual program level cost is fully embedded in our current run rate. and i wouldn't expect to see an increasing layer of cost associated, o&m cost associated with the sms program itself. and then finally, i think maybe the most important point is the derisking that's happening as a result of those programs, both in terms of asset programs and process safety, where we've implemented incremental process controls across risk areas in the business or critical tasks that might have high consequence risks associated with them, and we've been implementing those. we'll continue to do that. but those generally are reconfiguration versus incremental capacity in the business model. so i feel very good about where we are from a financial profile related to sms and safety and a lot of opportunity in front of us for further derisking of the business.
operator
and there are no further questions over the phone line at this time. i would now like to turn the call back to mr. joe hamrock for closing remarks. sir?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, r.j., and thank you all for your questions. let me close by just reiterating a few key points. one, that we're confident in our growth plan. we've executed a number of key stages in the current growth plan, notably the renewable generation projects, 13 of 14 now with regulatory approval or cpcn approval and the related transmission projects that go with that now underscores and underpins the $2 billion in renewable transition investments through 2023. and then the rfp that's underway for the 2021 irp, as shawn noted, includes 180 new proposals and giving us an updated picture of the opportunities for the future. add to that, four of our gas utilities are in base rate cases now all aligned with investments in modernization and safety that our customers value. and then finally, we've reaffirmed our 2021 guidance and our long-term growth rate commitments. so pleasure to be with you today and have an opportunity to share that story. we appreciate you joining us, and we appreciate your interest in and support of nisource. please stay safe.

operator
good morning. my name is r.j., and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the nisource second quarter 2021 investor call. [operator instructions] i would like to turn the call over to chris turnure, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
christopher turnure -- director of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to the nisource second quarter 2021 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, our chief executive officer; donald brown, our chief financial officer; shawn anderson, our chief strategy and risk officer; and randy hulen, our vp of investor relations and treasurer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. slides for today's call are available on nisource.com. before turning the call over to joe, donald and shawn, just a quick reminder. some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information included in our full financial schedules available at nisource.com. with all of that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, chris. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. we made significant progress in our generation transition and the current renewable replacement plan, with indiana commission approval now received for all of our joint venture renewable projects. in addition, we have received more than 180 proposals in our 2021 integrated resource plan, or irp process, which will inform our generation replacement strategy in indiana beyond 2023. we continue to expect that our infrastructure programs and generation investments will drive compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share from 2021 through 2024, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. let's turn now to slide three and take a closer look at our key takeaways. in the second quarter, we delivered non-gaap diluted net operating earnings of $0.13 per share. results reflect safety and modernization investments, covid impacts, and they reflect the profile of our business without columbia gas of massachusetts. we are reaffirming our earnings guidance and long term financial commitments. we expect 2021 earnings of $1.32 to $1.36 per share in non-gaap diluted net operating earnings. we continue to expect annual growth, safety and modernization investments of $1.9 to $2.2 billion, plus approximately $2 billion in renewables and associated transmission investments through 2023. nisource expects to grow its diluted net operating earnings per share by 7% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis from 2021 through 2024, including near-term annual growth of 5% to 7% through 2023.
as i mentioned, the indiana utility regulatory commission has approved 13 of our 14 proposed renewable energy projects and the new rfp for electric capacity and energy associated with nipsco's 2021 irp, that is currently underway, has drawn strong engagement from the vendor community. in other parts of our business, we filed rate cases in ohio, kentucky and maryland during the quarter, in addition to the case filed during the first quarter in pennsylvania, where we are in advanced settlement discussions. safety advancements continue across nisource, guided by our implementation of the industry's safety management system, which serves as our core operating model. recent advancements include the accelerated integration of contractors into our safety plans and deployment of picarro advanced leak detection technology in two more states. our environmental performance targets represent another vital commitment. i'm pleased to say that we remain on target. we expect to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030 from 2005 levels. that includes a 50% reduction in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025. on that commitment, nisource has already achieved an estimated 39% reduction in pipeline methane emissions compared to 2005 levels.
our infrastructure replacement programs are driving these improvements. also, last year, more than one million of our customers participated in our energy efficiency programs. on that note, let's look at some nisource utilities highlights for the second quarter, starting with our gas operations on slide nine. the ohio rate case is one of three new rate cases filed in the second quarter. we are requesting an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million, net of the trackers being rolled into base rates. pending a decision from the puco, new rates would be effective in mid-2022. in kentucky, we filed a request for an approximately $27 million annual revenue increase net of trackers. and in maryland, we filed a case on may 14, once again, net of trackers, requesting about a $5 million annual revenue increase. new rates are proposed to go into effect in december of this year. in pennsylvania, we filed a case just before the end of the first quarter, requesting an annual increase in revenue of approximately $98 million. now let's look at our electric operations on slide 10. i'll touch on nipsco's electric tdsic plan. we filed a new five year plan in june. the $1.6 billion plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. we expect to receive an order from the iurc in december of this year. the other items on this slide relate to our transition out of coal generation, and i'll turn it over to shawn anderson to give more detail.
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
thank you, joe. we continue to be encouraged by the strong progress advancing our renewable generation projects stemming from nipsco's 2018 irp. over the course of the last three months, eight renewables projects informed by the 2018 irp preferred pathway received approval from the indiana utility regulatory commission. this brings nipsco to the verge of an important milestone with 13 of 14 renewables projects approved to advance and replace the retiring capacity of the schahfer generating station. importantly, this includes all joint venture projects and leaves crossroads ii wind, a power purchase agreement, as the only project to waiting approval. combining these new generating facilities with a number of transmission projects to support system reliability across the new footprint, nisource continues to track toward approximately $2 billion of renewable generation investments through 2023. we are excited these projects will produce clean, reliable power for our communities, while saving nipsco customers approximately $4 billion over the long term. while the commercial and regulatory processes have advanced to support the preferred pathway for the 2018 irp, nipsco's 2021 irp process is well underway and continues to track within its time line. as noted in our release, in second quarter, we completed a request for proposal solicitation, similar to the process deployed in 2018. we are pleased with the response in terms of both the quality and the quantity of the proposals, which continues to show high levels of engagement in the vendor community as we advance our generation transition. furthermore, with these more than 180 proposals covering a wide range of technologies and ownership constructs, it continues to point to a robust market across generation technologies, which will drive value for our customers and stakeholders. a few notes about the process and timing.
the irp analysis that we are currently stepping through will utilize data from the rfp to help inform the broad resource portfolio options for nipsco in terms of michigan city retirement timing, choices of replacement technologies and ownership constructs. we will share directional findings with stakeholders at public advisory meetings in the third quarter, incorporating stakeholder feedback along the way. we expect to develop a stakeholder supported preferred resource path within the 2021 irp, which will be submitted to the iurc on or before november 1. once the preferred plan is finalized and communicated, execution activities could commence, which may include commercial negotiations and further due diligence on specific assets or projects. any specific projects then identified, which support this preferred plan would represent incremental projects beyond the 14 highlighted earlier and in addition to the approximately $2 billion in renewable investments nipsco has already filed. these are significant steps within nisource and are part of our energy transition, which we are calling your energy, your future, as we work with stakeholders to create a dependable, affordable and sustainable energy model, delivering the reliability our customers can trust. now i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our second quarter financial performance in more detail.
donald eugene brown -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, shawn, and good morning, everyone. looking at our second quarter 2021 results on slide four, we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to non-gaap net operating earnings of about $50 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. i would note that 2021 results exclude earnings related to columbia gas of massachusetts due to the sale closing in october of 2020. looking more closely at our segment three months non-gaap results on slide five. gas distribution [technical issues] operating earnings were about $66 million for the quarter, representing a decline of approximately $8 million versus last year [technical issues] down about $28 million due to the sale of cma [technical issues] upward in expenses also [technical issues] offset by higher employee related [technical issues] costs and outside services [technical issues], which was nearly $5 million lower than the second quarter of 2020. operating revenues rose about $11 million, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses due to infrastructure investments and increased customer usage.
operating expenses, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were up about $16 million due to generation related maintenance and employee related costs. now turning to slide six. i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our debt level as of june 30 was about $9.2 billion, of which about $9.1 billion [technical issues] was long term debt [technical issues] in years, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. at the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. with moody's recently concluding their latest credit review, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue to support our long term safety and infrastructure investments. let's take a quick look at slide eight, which highlights our financing plan. there are no changes to our plan since last quarter's equity unit issuance. last quarter's issuance has significantly derisked our financing plans and it's consistent with all of our earnings and credit commitments. as joe mentioned in our key takeaways, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance and long term financial commitments. i should remind everyone that we're stating the guidance and diluted earnings per share due to last quarter's equity issuance. thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest and support of nisource. we're now ready to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from richard sunderland from j. p. morgan. please go ahead.
richard sunderland -- j. p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. maybe just starting with the irp here. curious if you could outline the guard rails on the potential investment in any gating items here as we progress to the update in the first half of next year? you've just -- in terms of the high, low and where that could realistically fall in the [indecipherable]?
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
yes. thanks for that question. good morning, this is shawn. so ultimately, as you can imagine the range, will be informed by the actual project selected. so what we know now are the tranches of technology that we believe will provide the capacity. we need to step through the due diligence now to better understand those projects and that will inform and some way, shape or form the specifics of the range. so, certainly the selection of technology, the actual projects themselves, how efficient they can be constructed, those types of things will have a bearing on the ultimate capex for it. i'd also note that the miso resource adequacy rules, certainly as those finalize, could come into play a bit as well, though we think that we've modeled those out and incorporated that in the indicative pathway.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, thanks, shawn. rich, let me just add, all else being comparable through that analysis, we have a bias to own these assets as we step through this next progression. and we believe we have a strong case and a value proposition for doing that. as shawn noted the factors or guard rails as you said, do include the miso seasonal capacity factor ultimate requirements and the evaluation of the proposals that's still underway, but also the federal policy landscape that is a bit unpredictable right now, but that could shape timing and mix of investments as well. we look forward to being able to work through that in the next quarter or two.
richard sunderland -- j. p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for the color there. and maybe just following up on the subtle aspects. could you unpack that a little bit more in terms of what could specifically impact the 2021 irp considerations or maybe even more broadly, whether it's a financing plan? how could something like direct pay change those plans now.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
hi. i can take the direct pay question. certainly think that that provides some additional flexibility and how we finance our renewable investments, certainly positive if it allows us to reducing the equity needs for those future investments or external financing needs in terms of tax equity, but certainly need to understand how direct pay would be treated by our fixed jurisdictions from a base -- rate base and deferred tax standpoint.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
and then i just add on as it relates to how federal policy could shape the technology cost that we certainly can't speculate to that. the $750 million is a derivative of what we saw come through the rfp in may related to the capacity and the technology required to meet that capacity to the extent that the marketplace changes that efficiency and it could get you back into a different selection of technology to comprise the capacity necessary, but you'd have to see how that federal policy landscape would impact that marketplace versus to due diligence, which we're performing on actionable projects that came through the rfp that we expect to be able to execute against.
richard sunderland -- j. p. morgan -- analyst
understood. thank you for the time here. thanks.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thanks, rich.
richard sunderland -- j. p. morgan -- analyst
your next question comes from insoo kim from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you. my first question is just going back to the irp that $750 million potential, is that the total opportunity set, whether it's ppa or owned or does it contemplate some percentage of ownership there? and then the follow-up to that is, if we're taking the more accelerated retirement options and the 2026 retirements, how much of that potential investment could come in the 2025 time period?
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you for that. the $750 is the total inclusive amount of investment expected to be able to functionally deliver the capacity. once the capacity gap is created to the retirement of michigan city and schahfer's units a and b. so the everything included, also inclusive of the transmission that we anticipate necessary to construct to enable that to occur. and then in terms of timing, there is some flexibility because these projects in some ways could be a little bit modular in nature. it provides us a fair amount of flexibility to optimize that. the transmission work for example is going to begin immediately and it could take up to three years to complete the transmission work necessary to take those units offline. so the other resources could be feathered in, likely starting in that 2024 time horizon, but we'll know a lot more through the first half of 2022 after we've gone through the due diligence process and started to select the exact projects that we think can deliver that capacity.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's good color. and my second question is on the dividend policy. i think over the past -- or at this time around and then the past couple of years, i think the growth in the dividend has been a little bit more modest versus history and as we get back into this more robust eps growth cycle and i think you had a 60% to 70% payout ratio target as of the last disclosure. how should we think about some of the future dividend growth trends that you could see over the next few years?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
hi, good morning. for the 60% to 70% payout ratio that is still our guidance at this point. we will revisit our dividend on our -- in january as we normally do with the board, but when you look at our long-term plan in the 7% to 9% eps cagr that we've indicated, you certainly would expect to see growth in that range, saying growth along annually because of the earnings growth in that range of 60% to 70%. but again, we'll provide an update in january.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.

your next question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america. please go ahead.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is actually kody clark on for julian. thanks for taking my questions.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
good morning, kody.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
so first kind of a housekeeping item and just to clarify. if i'm thinking about 2023 eps, what base should i be using for the 5% to 7% growth? is it the top end of '21 or the midpoint of the new '22 guidance?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
i would use the top end of '21 as the guidance going forward for '22 and for our long-term 7% to 9% eps growth.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got it. and then, so one of the main variables on nipsco share of the capex tied to the irp would be the breakdown of ownership versus ppa and certainly understand the bias to own there, but wondering if you can talk about how you, other stakeholders and the regulators are thinking about ownership percentage of the resources? have you had any conversations here? how do you think that's going to shake out?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thanks for that question. we have not had any discussions regarding ownership percentage as we've just focused on the tranche of technology delivered -- to deliver the capacity and certainly that's been the main focus to understand what the solutions in the pathway we expect to transpire. and then we would need to complete the full due diligence necessary on the projects themselves to better understand that ownership percentage, although i'd note that certain of these asset classes track toward a higher ownership percentage, for example, sugar creek upgrade would make a lot of sense for us to own at our own plant. so there is a bias to own and some of these asset classes could track toward that. however, we need to complete the full due diligence to have a final point of view, which we expect in the midpoint of next year.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, kody, i'd only add to that, i would note that key drive results the cost to customers over the life of the projects and that's probably the first variable we look at for comparability across different ownership structures.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so looking forward to the first half updates and we've seen some of your peers introduce longer term capex and growth plans to highlight kind of the runway for spending. do you see yourself in a position to be able to provide that level of disclosure when some of these spending items around generation become a little bit more clear in the first half of next year?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, absolutely, we are intending to have an analyst day somewhere in that first half of next year. the goal of that analyst day would be to provide more clarity around next generation investments to replace the michigan city, as well as to extend a long-range plan for both our gas and electric businesses.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks so much for the time and looking forward to seeing you all next week.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thank you.

and your next question comes from travis miller from morningstar. please go ahead.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
good morning everyone and thank you.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
hey, good morning, travis.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
question on the electric side of nipsco vector, the irp. how do you think about the timing and the relationship between the irp and as you go through the process to irps, etc., and the tdsic? are regulators thinking about these in terms of the need for new transmission and distribution to supply and support the irp? and how does that work?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, that's a good question, travis. the tdsic really operates on kind of the existing transmission assets on maintenance and reliability improvements, not so much new capacity related to new generation or retiring generation. so there's not a direct relationship between tdsic. we're pending tdsic discussion as you note. it doesn't really depend in a meaningful way on the irp. typically, the projects we're looking at from the rfp within the integrated resource plan are tied to specific transmission investments that are inside the bids that we solicited. so, those really don't crossover in a meaningful way.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. so, we could see more transmission investment as you roll out some of the irp steps?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
that's right. just like we have in the current cycle or in the $2 billion includes pretty healthy transmission investment as well.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, great. and then on the gas side, what are your latest thoughts on all the discussion about methane emissions? where does that fit into your capex plan as, obviously, we've heard domestically and internationally?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, the epa methane rule is out now. we see clearly opportunities to improve the emissions profile, particularly that's focused on the upstream assets, exploration production and transmission storage, a little bit of a light touch on our asset portfolio. but overall, we believe the right way to drive a cleaner profile for the gas business and the gas supply chain. i would go to the other side and say one of the provisions inside the pending legislation or the proposed legislation is the methane tax, which we think is a bad mechanism. it basically just drives cost of customer without having the same -- or the same effectiveness as the epa methane. well, those two certainly work together, but the methane rule is a better mechanism. and that helps to drive sustainability of natural gas, and to do that in an affordable way, which we think is the right recipe.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. is there any upside to the capex -- gas capex of the government in u.s. or even international were to come down really hard on methane emission?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes. things that will handle the methane rule for the distribution entity still remain to be seen. we have to see how that rule plays out.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay, great, thanks so much.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thank you.

your next question comes from david peters from equity wolfe research. please go ahead.
david peters -- equity wolfe research -- analyst
yes. hey, good morning guys.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
good morning, david.
david peters -- equity wolfe research -- analyst
just on the higher earnings outlook of the new base -- the 2021 base. could you maybe talk about some of the factors that are underlying that better outlook in the interim and through '24? and then i know you have a couple of bigger rate cases pending, just wondering how sensitive to the plan is to some of the outcomes that are in there? and then just related to that, maybe you could comment, where you are -- where you guys are at in those cases, i guess, specifically, ohio?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes. thank you for the question. certainly, as we look at our plan, it's really built on the modernization investments that we're making. so think about 75% of those investments being tracked that gives us lots of confidence on our year-to-year earnings guidance. this year is a heavy year from a rate case standpoint. we did fall five base rate cases in our ldcs. we've got two settlements there and one other in maryland, we're expecting get an order in december and then the ohio and nipsco case that we filed will have impacts -- significant impacts from ohio by the middle of next year and in then the fourth quarter for nipsco. so that gives us confidence in our earnings guidance and the strength of our overall growth plan.
but that's what continues and really gives us confidence as we think about that 7% to 9% eps growth, which includes the $2 billion of generation investments that are already approved through the indiana commission this year. so that's the strength of our plan and that's really what gives us the confidence of being able to execute on that. otherwise, it comes down to o&m in managing that. we kicked off our nisource next transformation program a little over a year ago. that is going well within our plan and our guidance. it really is intended to reduce costs to help offset inflation aspects for thinking long-term around customer affordability, but also improve the rigor of our processes and allow us to improve our safety and customer service to our customers.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, let me pick it up there on the related question around ohio. the ohio rate case, donald touched on it, mid-year expectation in terms of the filing itself with a $221 million ask, net of rider. so there's a rider interplay there as well. but as we all know -- and not a lot to report at this time as we all know the puco has been very busy. and so as we see the current workload of the commission play out, we would expect momentum to pick up. no concerns with that. we're early in the schedule overall.
but that said, given that we're early and not a lot to report as you would expect and as we expected, discovery activities have been heavy so far, this being the first base case since 2008 for columbia gas of ohio. so no surprise there. and we believe that parties to the case recognize the long duration between the cases and our strong investment history and commitment to the state across a range of different activities, including economic development. so we remain confident in the mid '22 resolutions and that's all baked into our outlook for next year.
david peters -- equity wolfe research -- analyst
great, thank you. i appreciate all the detail. i just had one follow-up just on the financing plan and around kind of some of the things being proposed in washington. several of your peers have talked about how meaningful direct pay could be in helping fund future renewable investments and lowering equity needs. so, assuming that option is included, i'm guessing, it doesn't impact the approved projects at all, since you've done the funding for that. but you said in the rfp the $750 million you've outlined, i think historically you've said something like 60% equity content for new generation investments. do we effectively expect that to be materially reduced with a direct buy option?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, let me address the equity content first. so we think for the future investments of the $750 million, potential investment that we've got. if we would not need the same level of equity content, our balance sheet is going to be in much stronger position by the end of 2023 and so certainly be in more typical regulatory cap structure of 50/50. but having said that, direct pay does provide some flexibility and potentially reducing the need for external financing or reducing equity needs. so we do see it as a positive, but we've got to get more detail really to understand how that would impact rate bases and deferred taxes to see what the pure impact would be to our financing plan.
david peters -- equity wolfe research -- analyst
okay, great. thank you guys.
operator
thanks, david. and your next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim. please go ahead.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, guys. this is james moore here on for shar, how are you doing?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
great. good morning, james.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
i was just curious with the irp if it's taking into account cost inflation for renewables in determining what the actual project cost would be and if these submitting parties are going to be held to the fixed cost or if there's any allowance for cost inflation? and i have a second question on the gas side.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, james. i'll take that. so the estimate that we shared derives from the rfp process, which was for actionable projects toward the mid part of this decade, which align with the contemplated retirement of 16a/b and michigan city. we have asked for a period of time for us to evaluate those projects. when we go to the rfp marketplace, we ask for the opportunity to evaluate those for a period of time as you can imagine. we are still within that window. so we would be able to execute against those bids for those proposals still into 2022 and then continue through the refinement and due diligence process thereafter.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
right. so once you -- once the winners have been decided, just wanted to clarify if there is any potential for pass-through for higher commodity costs, higher other input costs, anything that could, delays on components etc., or if it's just like a fixed price regardless if we look the winners and i'm being curious if you thought that's decided yet?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
it's not decided yet. generally speaking, you think about it as a fixed cost that would then relate to that project and that project is still executable through a window of time that it's been bid. that's really through 2024, 2025, maybe 2026 depending upon the project and you'd have that fixed cost related to that project associated with that technology to the extent that that bid is executed within this window that we're describing. and to the extent that you continue through the due diligence process, you might understand more or less about what it would take on the total investment side, most notably transmission to action those projects.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. thank you for the clarification there. the second question on the ldcs, you've mentioned number of times you're seeing in excess of 10% rate base growth. first, how long should we think of that level of growth as being sustainable and then i have a follow-up?
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yes, i'll take the sort of the long view side of that question. and if you look at the $40 billion of identified investments that we rolled out on investor day, just a little over a year ago, that's really predominantly on the kinds of investments that are already in flight in the gas business in particular. electric is a little different with the transition from coal to renewables and clean energy. so, those are typically long dated programs. if you look at the underlying regulatory mechanisms, like the tdsic gas plan in nipsco, there's almost a $1 billion of identified investment approved in the gas tdsic plan. it's a multi-year beyond our '24 guidance horizon.
similarly, the ohio irp operates that way in virginia, the gas save program, similarly. so a lot of these are annualized programs with trackers to support them that run beyond our current 2024 long-term guidance horizon. so i'm not going to guide to a specific point in time where 10% rate base growth is predictable, that's the kind of update we'll give on analyst day next year. but the core point here is the underlying fundamental investment thesis is very long dated across all of the ldcs.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
perfect, that's i was hoping you'd say and expecting there. so that leads into the second part of the question. given the recent tracked evaluation data points that we've been seeing for where gas assets have been transacting at. how do you think strategically about your 10% plus rate base growers this long-term horizon and the potential for asset optimization to limit, other -- need for other types of financing over your forecast horizon? thank you.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, i'll take the front end and ask donald to touch on the financing side. so very much the same long-term strategic orientation when we look at a portfolio of companies that have that kind of fundamental growth opportunity that we see as long dated in constructive jurisdictions that's well supported, any rotation would have to be accretive to a plan that reflects that kind of growth engine build in across. really, literally, each and every company that we operate has that same profile right now. so it's a strategic question about long-term growth first and foremost. that said, we're very open minded, very analytical about that very objective and work very closely with our board to continuously assess that opportunity. as it comes to capital rotation and alternative forms of financing, let me ask donald to touch on that side of the question.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
yeah, it's a good question and certainly one we've gotten in the past, we'll continue to evaluate all forms of financing to finance our growth programs and our growth plan. it is a strategic question and certainly when i think about how we enhance that plan long term, certainly as we think about that next level of generation investments here, we'll evaluate that as well to see what makes the best sense for us long term.
james moore -- guggenheim -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much for the color and for taking my question.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thanks, james.

and there are no further questions at this time, i will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
hey, thanks, julie. and thank you all for your questions. let me just close by reiterating a few of the key takeaways from our release today. we are targeting the top end of our guidance range for 2021 and we initiated guidance for 2022 of $1.42 to a $1.48 that's diluted net operating earnings per share and our long-term growth commitments have been reaffirmed. i talked about it here on the call, the preferred plan for nipsco's irp, now advances our plans to retire all coal-fired generation to between 2026 and 2028. and nipsco's portion of those investments needed to replace this capacity will be evaluated in the coming months with an expectation to roll out more clarity and precision on that at an investor day to be held in the latter part of the first half of next year.
our progress on the gas rate cases continues. we've got settlements on the table, orders awaited in three states and filing of the new case in indiana, along with the ohio case is pending. and finally, again we do look forward to the steps between now and an investor day at the end of the first half of 2022, key opportunity for us to extend this long-term growth trajectory. and we do appreciate you for joining us this morning. we know it's a busy day for all of you, so please stay safe and make it a good day. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is chile and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the q3 2021 nisource earnings conference call. [operator instructions] chris turnure, you may begin your conference.
christopher turnure -- director of investor relations
good morning and welcome to the nisource third quarter 2021 investor call. joining me today are joe hamrock, our chief executive officer; donald brown, our chief financial officer; shawn anderson, our chief strategy and risk officer; and randy hulen, our vp of investor relations and treasurer. the purpose of this presentation is to review nisource's financial performance for the third quarter of 2021 as well as provide an update on our operations and growth drivers. following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. slides for today's call are available on nisource.com.
before turning the call over to joe, donald and shawn, just a quick reminder, some of the statements made during this presentation will be forward-looking. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the md&a and risk factors sections of our periodic sec filings. additionally, some of the statements made on this call relate to non-gaap measures. for additional information on the most directly comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and segment information, including our full financial schedules available on nisource.com.
with all of that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe.
joseph j. hamrock -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, chris. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our third quarter earnings release, which we issued earlier today. strong execution of nisource's significant renewable energy investments continues to be the highlight of our foundation for future growth and we continue to expect that our core infrastructure programs and renewable generation investments will drive industry leading compound annual growth of 7% to 9% in diluted net operating earnings per share through 2024, growth driven by our commitments to safety, reliability, customer affordability and sustainability.
as we begin to refine our outlook for longer-term growth, the preferred path from nipsco's 2021 integrated resource plan identifies additional investment opportunities, while advancing the retirement of remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 and it supports our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2030.
let's turn now to slide 3 and take a closer look at our key takeaways. we are updating our guidance for 2021 to target the top end of the range of a $1.32 to a $1.36 per share in non-gaap diluted net operating earnings or noeps. we are also initiating guidance for 2022 of a $1.42 to a $1.48 and that is consistent with our 5% to 7% near term growth commitment. our long-term diluted noeps guidance of 7% to 9% through 2024 is now based on the expected top end of our 2021 guidance range and we reaffirm 5% to 7% growth in 2023.
as i mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from nipsco's 2021 irp, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation. investments of up to $750 million will be required to replace retiring coal-fired generation. the nipsco portion of this investment will be better understood following further evaluation of the proposals we solicited associated with the irp. our regulatory execution progresses with a proposed order approving a settlement in pennsylvania, a settlement filed in kentucky and a proposed order in maryland. in addition, we filed a gas rate case in indiana in september. we achieved non-gaap diluted noeps of $0.11 in the third quarter of 2021 versus $0.09 in 2020.
now let's look at some nisource utilities highlights for the third quarter, starting with our gas operations on slide 9. columbia gas of ohio rate case continues to progress. net of the trackers being rolled into base rates, the filing requests an annual revenue increase of approximately $221 million. pending its decision next year from the public utilities commission of ohio, new rates would be effective in mid 2022. nipsco filed a gas rate case on september 29th requesting a revenue increase of $115 million annually. the case is focused on infrastructure modernization and providing safe, reliable service, while remaining in compliance with state and federal safety requirements.
in pennsylvania, an administrative law judge issued a proposed order recommending that the pennsylvania public utility commission approved the settlement in our rate case. the settlement would increased revenue by $58.5 million with new rates effective december 29th of this year. the adjusted rates will help to continue investments in infrastructure upgrades, system reliability and maintenance enhancements. we expect the commission's final order by mid-december.
in kentucky, we have filed a proposed settlement of our rate case. the settlement includes an overall increase in revenues of $18.6 million to support continued investments in safety and replacing aging infrastructure. columbia gas of maryland received a proposed order from an administrative law judge on friday, recommending an increase of approximately $2.56 million in revenues as compared to our request of approximately $4.8 million. we expect a final order from the maryland public service commission in december.
before we move on, i'd like to note the columbia gas of ohio, our largest ldc, is ranked number 1 in the midwest region in j.d. power's 2021 gas utility business customer satisfaction study. also congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the columbia gas and nipsco mobile apps. they are an important step forward in building our connected digital customer experience.
let's now turn to our electric operations on slide 10. nipsco's electric tdsic plan is pending before the indiana utility regulatory commission or iurc. this is a five-year $1.6 billion proposal that would replace the previous plan, which nipsco filed in april to terminate. the pending plan includes newly identified projects aimed at enhancing service and reliability for customers as well as some previously identified projects. the other items on this slide relate to our renewable generation strategy and i'll turn it over to shawn anderson to give more detail.
shawn anderson -- senior vice president and chief strategy and risk officer
thank you, joe. the selection of the preferred path from nipsco's 2021 irp is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation toward cleaner and reliable forms of generation, all of which are expected to save nipsco customers' approximately $4 billion over the long term. the preferred path from the 2021 irp refines the timeline to retire coal-fired generation at the michigan city generating station to between 2026 and 2028. it also calls for retirement of two vintage gas peaking units 16a and 16b, which are both located at the schahfer generating station site.
the most viable replacement option calls for our portfolio of resources, including incremental solar, stand-alone battery storage and natural gas peaking resources. we estimate that investments of up to $750 million will be required to support the retirements of these units. we expect to be able to quantify the nipsco portion of this investment opportunity in the first half of next year after further evaluating bids and the request for proposals and completing due diligence on projects, which align with the preferred path.
meanwhile, we continue to execute on the plan for retirement of remaining coal-fired generation at schahfer. units 14 and 15 retired as of october 1st and units 17 and 18 are on track to retire by 2023. we are making steady progress on the renewables project build out, informed by the preferred path from nipsco's 2018 irp. our partners on these projects are some of the strongest developers in the renewable energy space and we remain in close contact regarding the progress of these projects. we continue to expect to invest approximately $2 billion in renewable generation by 2023 to replace the retiring capacity at schahfer.
as part of the execution of this plan, construction continues on the indiana crossroads i wind project, which is on track to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year. construction has also started on a pair of solar projects dunns bridge solar i is being constructed by a subsidiary of nextera energy resources under a build transfer agreement. edp renewables north america is building the indiana crossroads solar project, which will be operated as a joint venture. both are expected to enter service next year.
the iurc provided regulatory approval of the indiana crossroads ii wind project on september 1st and with that action, all 14 renewables projects needed to replace the retiring capacity of schahfer generating station, have now received approval. in addition to the slate of renewables projects we have announced, nisource plans to evaluate hydrogen in emerging storage technologies. it's important for us to gain a risk informed understanding of the options and technologies that may emerge as pathways toward further decarbonization.
now i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our third quarter financial performance in more detail.
donald brown -- executive vice president/chief financial officer & president, nisource corporate services
thanks, shawn and good morning everyone. before getting into the specific results, i'd just like to highlight the solid execution and progress that now has us guiding to the top end of our 2021 guidance range of a $1.32 to a $1.36. this new 2021 expectation also serves as the starting point for both our near-term and long-term commitment. we have also initiated 2022 guidance of a $1.42 to a $1.48, which at its midpoint represents a growth rate of over 6.6% from the 2021 top end.
turning to our third quarter 2021 results on slide 4. we had non-gaap net operating earnings of about $47 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to non-gaap net operating earnings of about $36 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. the 2021 results reflect our ongoing execution of infrastructure investments, offset somewhat by the sale of columbia gas of massachusetts, which closed in october of 2020.
looking more closely at our segment three-month non-gaap results on slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of approximately $8 million versus last year. operating revenues, net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were down nearly $18 million due to the sale of cma. operating expenses also net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were lower by about $26 million, mostly due to the cma sale, offset slightly by higher employee-related costs and outside services spending.
in our electric segment, three-month non-gaap operating earnings were about $130 million, which was nearly $3 million lower than the third quarter of 2020. net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses, operating revenues decreased slightly by about $2 million due to slightly lower residential usage, offset by increased tdsic revenues. operating expenses net of the cost of energy and tracked expenses were nearly flat compared to 2020.
now turning to slide 6, i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our debt level as of june 30 was about $9.6 billion of which about $9.2 billion was long-term debt. the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 14 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.7%. at the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and other accounts receivable securitization programs.
as we know, last quarter, all three major rating agencies have reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings with stable outlooks in 2021. taken together, this represents a solid financial foundation to continue the support for our long-term safety and infrastructure investments. as you can see on slide 7, we've narrowed our 2021 capital investment estimate to approximately $2 billion and reiterated our 2022 capital forecast of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
taking a quick look at slide 8, which highlights our financing plan. there are no changes to our plan since april's equity unit issuance. i would highlight that this balanced financing plan continues to be consistent with all of our earnings growth and credit commitments. as i mentioned earlier, we have updated our 2021 earnings guidance, issued guidance for 2022 and reaffirmed our long-term growth commitments. i would also remind everyone that we're planning to provide an extension to our growth plan at an investor day during the first half of next year. so please stay tuned.
thank you all for participating today and for your ongoing interest in and support of nisource. we're ready now to take your questions.

(operator instructions) our first question comes from the line of paul ridzon of keybanc. your line is now open.
paul ridzon -- keybanc -- analyst
good morning, joe. good morning, don.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, paul.
paul ridzon -- keybanc -- analyst
just a quick question, i looked at your second quarter deck and the third quarter. the financing plan slide really hasn't changed with regards to the atm. i think there's some confusion in the market that this announcement today is incremental to the prior atm. can you just clarify that's not the case?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, paul. good morning. no that's -- there's $200 million, $300 million that we outlined in q2 is still the plan. the atm that we filed -- the new atm we filed this morning is consistent with that. as you recall, we had used up all of the previous atms and needed to file a new one.
paul ridzon -- keybanc -- analyst
and then looking at slide 12. can you -- that's like the cost estimate on the lawrence incident. how much of this is covered by insurance? or what's not going to be covered by insurance?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so our insurance coverage is fairly broad to cover this type of event and incident. we got total liability coverage of about $800 million and expect substantially all of these costs to be recovered through the process. however, we did not book a receivable at our september 30 close, because it's early in the process. we really are in q4 incurring both of these expenses and felt that it was prudent to really get through seeing the claims and the cost before booking a receivable, which we'll do as q4.
paul ridzon -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. okay. thank you very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
and paul just to clarify slide 12 also includes the capital expenditures related to the system rebuild those obviously would not be insurance-related costs.
paul ridzon -- keybanc -- analyst
understood, understood.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

and our next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin-smith of bank of america merrill lynch. your line is now open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, julien.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
just to clarify the last one there quickly, so when you said, subsequently all of it would be recoverable from insurance that's under the additional incident-related expenses of $415 million to $450 million the $180 million to $210 million?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's correct, julien, it's both of those categories, is really from a accounting perspective and now we need to book -- show that from an accounting perspective. we've put it in the two categories around third-party claims and other expenses. but they are all event expenses that we expect to be recovered through insurance.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
got it. excellent. and just a follow-up on that. in terms of the rate case timing, obviously withdraw it, what's the expectation with respect to going back in mass once it's said and done and filing for a recovery or whatever you deem appropriate? at then at the same time, how are the rating agencies viewing and how are you viewing your balance sheet given the cash flow timing issues perhaps related to insurance there?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, julien. it's joe. i will take the first part. our focus is on the restoration effort and getting customers back in service. those are questions for another day related to the older regulatory plan for the investments we've been making.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
from a financing standpoint, obviously, it's a large event that we are financing now. we have significant liquidity to finance this event. however, we are looking at -- ensuring that we hit our metrics that we've are promised at year-end here 2018 and assessing any needs to make sure that we hit that. but, again, it's all timing around financing because we do expect to recover the claims expenses through insurance.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
one quick clarification on capital spend with the irp. when do you expect to more fully delineate some of the timeline for generation associated with that nipsco filing?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's a work in progress julien. that's one of the areas that we expect to update when we do a further look probably mid-2019.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
okay, excellent. thank you all very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

and our next question comes from the line of christopher turnure of jp morgan. your line is now open.
christopher turnure -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning, joe and don. you guys clearly talked about the expenses related to the incident in massachusetts and definitely, we appreciate the details there. but is there a way to think about cost that might not directly be related to that? and perhaps other parts of the company or perhaps corporate costs outside of what you've outlined here that could spill into 2019 or future years?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a good question, chris, and good morning. it's a little early for that. but that's the area that we would expect to delineate more in our 2019 guidance on our q4 call.
christopher turnure -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. but we should assume that there might be some pressure there that wouldn't necessarily be able to be offset by cost discipline in other areas. is that fair?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
i don't know that i'd go to that extent. we've got work to do to pull all those details together. but i don't see it that way at this point.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i'd say -- i'd add that we don't expect that this change is our long-term guidance, 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth. we came out last year committing to flat o&m expense after 2017 and we still expect to be able to meet that commitment.
christopher turnure -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then in massachusetts specifically clearly out of the gate there were plenty of negative headlines directed toward the company. and i think the dpu even came out with some sort of suspension of work request for you. since that time, could you characterize how your dialogue has been with both the political and regulatory community there?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. you recognize some of the issues that we've worked through over the last several weeks since the incident. we worked day-by-day with leaders in the state and the community and our partners across this to all stay focused on restoration of service to the community and the customers in the community. and i would say that is very collaborative effort working very closely together. we will have work to do as we get beyond service restoration as well with ongoing effort to replace some of the equipment that we will repair immediately. so this has got a longer tail on it than just service restoration and we've made a long-term commitment to rebuild trust and confidence in the community and with the leaders in the state.
christopher turnure -- jpmorgan -- analyst
would you say that there has been an ongoing dialogue there since the initial incident?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're day-to-day working very closely together.
christopher turnure -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

and our next question comes from the line of insoo kim of goldman sachs. your line is now open.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
just on the financing side. it seems like you're leaving some room open for potentially more preferred equity or subordinated debt? is that kind of an option for this as well as next year as a financing vehicle away from additional equity or atm to support your credit metric guidance for 2019 and 2020?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thank you. yes, it was certainly a good transaction the preferred equity that we did in may. we continued to look at that option as a long-term lower cost way to provide equity content versus issuing common equity. so absolutely. however, we will continue compare that versus issuing through the atm program as well as regular debt financing.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. and then given what's happened in massachusetts, do you see as you look forward to next few years the mix of your future capex and rate base items leaning a bit more toward gas versus electric? or does that not really change that much?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so i wouldn't think at this point the mix is going to change in any significant way. i think we're certainly working through our electric generation plan and we will be able to provide an update on that in mid-2019. but at this point, i don't see a significant departure from the current mix.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of steve fleishman of wolfe research. your line is now open.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. good morning. just to clarify better on -- you mentioned the rating agency commitment. so were some of the options -- you mentioned kind of options to make sure you meet them for this year. is it just kind of timing of your atm? or is it other things that you might do if you need to?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i really think it's certainly timing. if we were to do any type of transaction with equity content it really is timing to support the restoration efforts in massachusetts. but the atm program that we filed as well as if we were to issue any type of preferred or equity content security that would support hitting our metrics at year-end. we are looking at as we evaluate cash flows and metrics.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and if you kind of step back and look at your whole system, are you reviewing kind of timing of replacing pipes or other operational changes kind of more broadly as a company in your other states?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, steve, we're always reviewing that. it's always a risk-based evaluation. we do that on an ongoing basis. as i noted earlier in the call, we have also reviewed the profile around low-pressure systems and we expect to make some investments along that line of assets as well in the near future. but we're still working through the details on that and we would expect to share more on that in the near future.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
but i would add that, if you think about our programs in each state, we typically have 5- and 7-year commitments around our infrastructure investments. and so i would not expect a material change state-to-state as we do intend to hit those commitments on those programs.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. have a good day.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of shar pourreza of guggenheim partners. your line is now open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, shar.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
don, do you have just around the ongoing o&m expense, i mean presumably you're doing a lot more inspections to your system given sort of the design failure. do you have sort of an estimate what could be ongoing in the near-term at least?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so -- no, it's something that we are evaluating right now as we look at our operations and the needs. joe outlined some of the steps that we're taking around low-pressure systems. and we'll be able to provide more information in the future on that. but at this point, don't expect there to be significant o&m that would change our long-term o&m plan.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then just on massachusetts, when do you expect sort of everyone to sort of come back to their homes, right? and then, again, just remind us how many are still outside of their homes?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we announced last week a revision to the original schedule that now has the enrollment return between december 2 and december 16, though we work everyday to accelerate that schedule. and we're still pushing for earlier than those dates with resource redeployment, additional resources, bringing in additional contractors. so it's an urgent focus across the entire team to work toward an accelerated return home for those affected customers is very disruptive for them. in terms of the number who are out right now, subject to check, i need to look at the most recent. but we have -- we provide daily stats on the number of folks that are in alternative housing and the number of folks that are affected by this and still not able to function in their homes normally. so as we sit here today, we've restored about 20% of the affected customers. and we work with each of the affected customers to be sure they're accommodated.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
excellent. okay. thanks so much.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of michael weinstein of credit suisse. your line is now open.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
hi. good morning, joe and don.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
just to be clear, the equity plan is unchanged essentially going forward and that includes the expectation for an accelerated capital replacement program that's happening right now in massachusetts. so that in other words, there's no additional equity that you think might be needed as a result of accelerating the program?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that is correct. we executed on this work in massachusetts and just think about it from a resource standpoint. we brought a lot of resources over from other states to support this effort in massachusetts. and so we did balance out a little bit across the states, so that our overall capital plan doesn't change significantly. there were also let's say some lower priority corporate and it initiatives that we delayed that supported not really changing our capital plan and -- or our financing need.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
got it. and also for the guidance, the guidance is unchanged for eps 5% to 7% growth. but is that -- are you still also trying to say that you'll be in the middle of that guidance? or is there any change or shift in that -- into the range?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
for 2018?
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
it's going forward the 5% to 7%.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so 5% to 7% -- yes, i think, if you recall thinking about the range of outcomes for our business it's primarily driven by our infrastructure programs and 75% of that is tracked. and so the movement within the range is really around regulatory outcomes and timing of those outcomes, o&m expense and financing cost. so i think, this doesn't change that -- this event does not change that from a long-term standpoint.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
and has anything changed regarding your plan for an analyst day next year? maybe sometime around the end of the first quarter or?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, as i noted on the call earlier, we're now looking at mid-2019 for an analyst day and an update on the longer range plan.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse. -- analyst
got you. i miss that. okay. thank you very much.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer

operator
and our next question comes from the line of charles fishman of morningstar research. your line is now open.
charles fishman -- morningstar research. -- analyst
thank you. certainly i haven't looked at the irp that you submitted yesterday, but it appears from your slides that there has been an accelerated -- you're accelerating your coal plant retirements from what you had previously indicated, which is certainly not unique in the industry. joe, i guess my question is, what drove you to that decision to accelerate coal plant retirements? was it the more renewable energy or the cost of renewable energy was lower than you thought going into this? was it discussions with the commission? was it just customer feedback? first that, and then i guess related to that is, does this -- do you have the ability to downsize your environmental upgrades at michigan city and schahfer because it would appear that you'd be retiring those units earlier than you had originally planned?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, charles. and thanks for the question. we did as you noted accelerate relative to the last integrated resource plan accelerate the plan for coal retirements with now all of the schaefer stations related for retirement within the next 5 years and the michigan city unit within 10 years. and it was driven by -- i would characterize it is all of the factors that you've noted a rigorous economic analysis looking at the long run cost -- expected cost of all available sources including -- continuing to run the existing assets providing for environmental retrofits known to comply with current regulations. and then to look at we ran an rfp earlier in the year that we shared with stakeholders for -- and all of the above supply portfolio to replace capacity. and when we you ran -- when we ran all of that analysis and looked at all of the options, what emerged as the best solution or the most viable solution is the plan that we've put out yesterday with the irp with that further acceleration of coal retirement. and as we sit here today an expectation that renewables would be the most viable -- most economic and cleanest supply portfolio for us. we will continue to evaluate that side of it as we stepped through time. we look at what's available in the marketplace now and then we'll take another look as we get closer to the timeline of needing to replace capacity across the next 10 years. so that's an ongoing evaluation. and so the rate case was also filed yesterday. it's really designed to complement that integrated resource plant to reset the depreciation rates, to now acknowledge the accelerated retirement plan. and with your last question, you may recall that we filed last year a cpcn for both the ccr and elg both the coal ash and the water rule compliance. and we have proceeded with the ccr, but we'll continue that because that compliance date is upon us. on the elg side, the water rule we continue to evaluate that and likely would not make those investments under this plan consistent with what you indicated in your question. so it's a comprehensive look at all of the options, all of the economics and coming up with a solution that best fits our expected needs and our customer's supply needs.
charles fishman -- morningstar research. -- analyst
so it sounds like though the irp is -- you're coordinating that with your base rate cases, so there won't be any risk of stranded investment here where you recently made some environmental upgrades and you're stuck with the -- you're prevented from recovering all of it, correct?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
that's the idea. to get the rate case to set the depreciation rates for the existing assets so that we can move forward in time with other decisions based on having established that foundation.
charles fishman -- morningstar research. -- analyst
okay, that's all i have. thank you.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
(operator instructions) and we have a follow-up from line of charles fishman. your line is now open.
charles fishman -- morningstar inc -- analyst
okay. well since nobody else had one, let me just pop-in one more quick one. you've always included slide -- there is something like slide 14 that shows roughly 75% of your investments are recovered within 12 months. you had this tracker, i forget was it approved in ohio? or you're proposing it i guess in ohio -- or you reached a settlement, i'm sorry, that includes this new tracker? would that increase the percentage of investments recovered under trackers, so you would be going over 75% now?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that is correct, charles. that portion of our investment in ohio typically would have gone through a base rate case until now. from ohio perspective, almost all of the investments would be recovered through a tracker or a writer.
charles fishman -- morningstar inc -- analyst
i mean in ohio is significant. so it could conceivably be touching 80% of your investments covered by trackers now. is that -- am i thinking about that correctly?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd have to look at it. we can get back to you and we'll certainly will update that once that order is approved, yes.
charles fishman -- morningstar inc -- analyst
and that's the direction, right?
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you.

julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
hey, guys. just wanted to follow up here on this irp, just a little bit more detail if you can. curious, you have a pretty healthy amount of solar in that irp especially even in the near dated years for 2023. how are you thinking about your ability to own that? and do you have any constructs rate basing it? because obviously that has -- could have a potential meaningful impact.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we're looking at opportunities to own that as well as ppa. when we ran irp for the rfp, this summer bids came in for both ppa as well as ownership. we're looking at what that opportunities are around ownership and firming up those bids. i mean what that structure would be to include that in rate base. so that will be part of our plan and how we would come out next year to talk about future investments in generation. but we think certainly opportunity to own.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch. -- analyst
right. and you would expect that given the 2023 timeline for that irp that you'll be issuing rfps in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe to take measure itc?
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't know if we've come out with a date yet on the next rfp. but certainly we would need to likely -- i'd say, you're probably right. it's probably in the 2021 timeframe to be in place by 2023.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to q3 2018 nisource earnings conference call. (operator instructions) as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the call over to randy hulen, vice president of investor relations. sir, please begin.
randy hulen -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, mark, and good morning, everyone. welcome to the nisource third quarter 2018 investor call. joining me this morning are joe hamrock chief executive officer; and donald brown chief financial officer. the purpose of today's call is to review nisource's financial performance for the third quarter 2018, as well as provide an update on our operations, growth drivers and financing plans. following our presentation, we'll open the call up to your questions. before turning the floor over to joe and donald, just a quick reminder.

with all that out of the way, i'd like to turn the call over to joe.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, randy. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. as most of you know in the period since our last investor call, nisource and our customers in the greater lawrence, massachusetts area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. this tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at nisource and columbia gas and we realized that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in greater lawrence and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. in greater lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers and restoring the impacted communities.
we are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible. safety and the care of our customers is very foundation of our business. although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our seven-state footprint to enhance system safety. those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low-pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management, and enhanced damage prevention protocols. in addition, the plan includes responsive measures such as designs that would automatically shutdown an affected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.
across nisource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities. and our team in indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.
let's now turn to slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter. our non-gaap net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the greater lawrence event were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of $1.26 to $1.32 for 2018. and we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018. we are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020.
as of tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities, in lawrence, massachusetts. additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses house ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. we're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible. meanwhile, our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states.
just yesterday, we achieved two milestones in our electric business in indiana. we submitted our latest integrated resource plan to the indiana utility regulatory commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the integrated resource plan. and we continue to execute on both our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program. in our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in indiana and settlements are pending in our maryland and pennsylvania base rate cases. we filed a new rate case in virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in massachusetts. in ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our capital expenditure program rider case. we continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint and our application for a long-term program extension in maryland was also approved.
now i'd like to turn the call over to donald, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail.
donald brown -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, joe, and good morning, everyone. before talking about our non-gaap earnings, i'd just like to note that our third quarter gaap results include our current estimates of the emergency response, system restoration and other expenses associated with the greater lawrence event. and we will likely see additional incident-related expenses in subsequent quarters. however, we do expect to substantially recover these expenses through insurance. but as of yet have not recorded any insurance recoveries as of september 30. excluding this impact, we continue to expect to deliver on our net operating earnings per share guidance for 2018 and deliver on our $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion capital investment plan.
on slide 5, you'll see our non-gaap net operating earnings were approximately $35 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter compared with approximately $23 million or $0.07 per share in the same period of 2017. through the first 9 months of 2018, our net operating earnings are approximately $321 million or $0.91 per share, putting us right on track to deliver on our guidance commitment for 2018, which is $1.26 to $1. 32 per share, excluding the impact of cma event.
let's turn now to the non-gaap financial results for our business segments. looking at slide 6, our gas distribution operations segment had an operating loss of about $3 million for the quarter compared with an operating loss of about $9 million in the same period of 2017. operating earnings excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform were about $25 million higher than a year ago driven primarily by increased infrastructure investment revenue and lower employee and administrative expenses.
our electric operations segment covered on slide 7 reported operating earnings of about $123 million for the quarter compared with operating earnings of about $130 million in the same period of 2017. however, excluding the regulated revenue impact of tax reform, our electric segment operating earnings were about $7 million higher than a year ago. this increase was primarily due to lower o&m, increased infrastructure investment revenues, offset slightly by decreased industrial usage.
now turning to slide 8, i'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile. our total debt level as of september 30 was about $8.8 billion of which about $7 billion was long-term debt. the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt was approximately 19 years and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.6%. at the end of the third quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of about $1.1 billion consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitizations.
i'd now like to turn to some additional details about our financing plan and recent actions, which are covered on slide 9.
as you know, in may, we sold approximately 25 million shares of common stock in a private placement with proceeds of approximately $600 million. and in june, we initiated a long-term debt refinancing, which included issuing $400 million of preferred stock and $350 million of 5-year notes, the proceeds of which were used to acquire certain outstanding notes totaling $760 million through tender offers and redemptions.
and these transactions were completed in mid-july. these steps address the cash and credit impacts of federal tax reform, improved our credit metrics and strengthened our balance sheet. and it put us back on track with our previous financing plan to fund our long-term growth investments. this plan includes annual equity in the range of $200 million to $300 million from an atm program and $35 million to $60 million from our employee stock purchase and other programs. consistent with this plan, we filed an atm equity issuance program with the sec earlier this morning. this is consistent with our approach to provide balanced predictable financing for our infrastructure investments. and the atm program file today allows us to issue up to $500 million in equity through the end of 2020.
this year's financing activity and execution of our financing plan going forward is expected to enhance our credit profile by strengthening our funds from operations to debt metric to 13% by the end of 2018 and improve to a 14% to 15% range in 2019 and beyond.
now i'll turn the call back to joe, who will discuss a few infrastructure investment and regulatory highlights.
joe hamrock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, donald. now let's turn to some specific highlights for the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018 from our gas operations on slide 10. new gas distribution rates took effect october 1 in indiana, following iurc approval of the settlement agreement in our base rate case. the settlement supports continued investments in system upgrades and other measures to enhance pipeline safety and system reliability. the settlement is expected to ultimately increase annual revenues by approximately $107 million, once new rates are fully implemented. also in indiana, we continue to execute on our long-term gas modernization program with investments planned through 2020. our application for a new 7-year program was dismissed without prejudiced by the iurc, due to pending legal matters. and we're reviewing options to refile our application at a later date.
in pennsylvania, we filed a settlement agreement in our base rate case on august 31. the settlement supports continued system upgrades and replacement of natural gas distribution pipelines and reflects the implementation of tax reform legislation. if approved as filed, the settlement is expected to increase annual revenues by $26 million. a pennsylvania public utility commission order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 with new rates effective in december. in ohio, we filed a settlement agreement on october 25 with parties to our application for an annual capital expenditure program rider. the initial approximately $75 million rider would allow us to begin recovering capital investments and other deferred expenses made between 2011 and 2017, that are not currently recovered under our infrastructure modernization tracker.
the settlement also benefits customers by reducing base rates by approximately $23 million to reflect the impact of federal tax reform. in virginia, we filed a base rate case with the virginia state corporation commission on august 28, seeking to recover costs associated with ongoing infrastructure investment programs and to incorporate changes from federal tax reform. if approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by $22.2 million including $8 million in revenues currently collected through the infrastructure tracker. we've requested that new rates go into effect on february 1, 2019, and we expect the commission order in the second half of 2019. in maryland, we're awaiting a commission decision on our base rate case settlement, which calls for new rates to be in effect later this month.
this settlement filed july 31 resolves all, but one issue in the case and is expected to increase annual revenues by $3.7 million. if approved as filed, the maryland commission has approved our application for a 5-year extension of our strategic infrastructure development and enhancement plan or stride, which is our modernization program in the state. in massachusetts, we've withdrawn our base rate case application, so that we can remain focused on our system rebuild and service restoration efforts in greater lawrence.
now let's turn to our electric operations on slide 12. as i noted earlier nipsco submitted it's 2018 integrated resource to the iurc yesterday.
the irp calls for the retirement of nearly 80% of our remaining coal-fired generation capacity in the next 5 years and all coal generation to be retired within 10 years. the replacement capacity portfolio is still being defined and options point toward lower-cost renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and battery storage technology. the plan is consistent with the company's goal to transition to the most economical, cleanest electric supply mix available, while maintaining reliability, diversity and flexibility for future technology and market changes. also yesterday, we filed an electric base rate case. the request seeks changes to our depreciation schedules related to the early retirements of coal-fired generation plants called for in the irp, as well as changes in tariffs to provide service flexibility for industrial customers as they seek to remain competitive in the global marketplace. it also reflects the impact of federal tax reform.
if approved as filed, the request would increase annual revenues by approximately $21 million. and iurc order is anticipated in the third quarter of 2019 with rates effective in september 2019. investments in our coal combustion residuals capital projects are progressing and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. these projects include environmental upgrades that are generating facilities to meet current epa standards. in december 2017, the iurc approved a settlement authorizing these projects and recovery of associated costs. we continue to execute on our 7-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to our electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.
the iurc approved program represents approximately $1.25 billion of electric infrastructure investments expected to be made through 2022. a settlement was filed october 25 in our latest tracker update request, which remains pending. it benefits customers with an approximately $14 million base rate refund for the january through may 2018 period reflecting new federal tax rates.
