operator
good morning, my name is christian and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the potlatchdeltic fourth quarter 2020 conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you.
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. jerry richards, vice president and chief financial officer, for opening remarks. sir, you may proceed.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you christian. good morning and welcome to potlatchdeltic's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. while he is a familiar face to you, this is eric cremers' first earnings call as president and chief executive officer.this call will contain forward-looking statements. please review the warning statements in our press release, on the presentation slides and in our filings with the sec concerning the risks associated with these forward-looking statements. also, please note that a reconciliation of non-gaap measures can be found on our website at www.potlatchdeltic.com.
i'll now turn the call over to eric for some comments and then i will cover our fourth quarter results and our outlook.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jerry. jerry mentioned, this is my first earnings call as the company's chief executive officer. i want to start by thanking mike covey, who retired after being our ceo for 14-years and is now continuing with the company as our executive chairperson.
potlatchdeltic is a very different company today due to his leadership. over that time we converted to a reit, we spun-off our pulp and paper assets, we improved the performance of our core businesses and we completed a very successful merger with deltic timber. today, we have high quality assets, a winning strategy that is well aligned with industry fundamentals, and investment grade balance sheet and a strong commitment to increasing shareholder value over the long-term through disciplined and opportunistic capital allocation decisions. i worked very closely with mike in the 14-years that i've been with the company. he was an excellent mentor and our philosophies are well aligned. i do not anticipate any significant changes to our strategy going forward.
now turning to our 2020 results. 2020 was a phenomenal year by virtually every measure. we generated adjusted ebitda of $382 million in 2020, which is a record since we elected reit status in 2006. furthermore, all three of our business units posted record profitability in 2020. i want to thank our employees for their performance, flexibility, creativity and continued focus through the covid pandemic. our outstanding 2020 results are attribute to a group committed to operating at the highest level.
our wood products segment generated $176 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020. our employees strong resolve and focus on operating safely allowed us to take advantage of robust demand and historic lumber prices. and in fact, both our bemidji, minnesota and our waldo, arkansas sawmills had stellar safety performance going incident free in 2020.
on the operational front we shipped just under 1.1 billion board feet of lumber and completed virtually all of our capital projects on time and under budget, despite the challenges presented by the covid pandemic. safety and managing the risks presented by the pandemic remained our top priorities.
our timberland segment generated $183 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020. indexed idaho sawlog prices hit record levels in the second half of the year and our southern team did a good job catching up the harvest shortfall caused by customer mill curtailments in the second quarter. timberlands harvested 6 million tons for the year, which was our plan at the start of the year and is a new annual record.
our real estate segment generated adjusted ebitda of $87 million in 2020. the team successfully closed the sale of 72,000 acres in minnesota to the conservation fund for nearly $48 million. our partnership with the conservation fund has been a catalyst, which will ultimately conserve approximately 200,000 acres in minnesota for various conservation purposes. fourth quarter sale is a significant milestone in our long-term strategy to sell minnesota land at a meaningful premium.
on the development side of our real estate business, sales activity in our chenal valley master planned community in little rock fared much better than we expected when the covid pandemic began. we sold 138 residential lots and completed a commercial sale during the year.
looking to 2021, housing fundamentals remained stronger than at any point since the great financial crisis. this has created an exceptional lumber demand environment, and we expect that lumber demand will continue to grow in 2021. us housing starts increased to 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits exceeded 1.7 million units in december. single family starts were 1.34 million units in december, which is the highest level since september 2006.
on an unadjusted basis single family starts in december increased 30% year-over-year and this is important to lumber demand as it more than made up for a decline in unadjusted multifamily starts, because each single family home utilizes three times more lumber than does a multifamily unit. many industry pundits including some on the call today are using the phrase super-cycle to refer to the current single family cycle and associated lumber demand and frankly we concur with that view. massive underbuilding since the great financial crisis, record low inventories of homes for sale, historically low mortgage rates and millennials entering their prime home buying years set the stage for this fundamental improvement in the housing cycle.
additionally, a shift from urban to suburban living appears to be positively affecting housing demand for homebuilders reported order growth of 35% on average last week. toll brothers, one of the country's largest homebuilders, recently said that this was the best housing market they had ever seen. these factors all suggest that housing construction will remain robust for the foreseeable future.
the repair and remodel segment is also expected to continue to grow. that view is supported by the age of the us housing stock, which is now 42-years on average, high levels of home equity, the work-from-home trend and positive demand signals from the big box home supply stores like home depot and lowe's.
underlying lumber demand remains strong and lumber inventories are estimated to be at the low end of their historic range. while lumber prices could moderate later this year, we expect lumber prices to remain higher than long-term averages. this is particularly important to potlatchdeltic given our leverage to lumber. we remained very optimistic about the setup heading into the 2021 building season.
turning to capital allocation, we returned $123 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2020. we are committed to growing the dividend sustainably and we increased the dividend 2.5% in the fourth quarter. the discretionary mill capital projects represent some of our highest potential returns. we plan to spend just under $30 million in our sawmills in 2021 with average expected returns on discretionary projects of 32%. liquidity of $631 million provides a strong platform as we consider additional investments in our existing mills or accretive acquisitions.
we are interested in acquiring timberlands, mills are a combination of the two near our current operating areas. we are currently working on our 2020 environmental social and governance report and we plan to publish the report in may, potlatchdeltic has a very strong esg story and we are committed to do our part to mitigate climate change and continue our legacy responsibility across the esg spectrum.
to wrap up my comments potlatchdeltic is very well positioned to take advantage of very favorable industry fundamentals and our strong balance sheet and our liquidity provides a high degree of flexibility as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
i will now turn it over to jerry to discuss fourth quarter results and our outlook.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, eric. starting with page 4 of the slides, adjusted ebitda increased from $135 million in the third quarter to $164 million in the fourth quarter, leading the company record that was just set last quarter. higher indexed idaho log prices and a bulk land sale of minnesota more than offset seasonally lower harvest in lumber shipment volumes.
i will now review each of our operating segments and provide more color on the fourth quarter results. information for our timberland segment is displayed on slides 5 through 7. the segment's adjusted ebitda was $62.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $59.7 million in the third quarter. we harvested 378,000 tons of sawlogs in the north in the fourth quarter. this was down seasonally from the 555,000 tons that we harvested in the third quarter. northern sawlog prices were 37% higher on a per ton basis in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
the increase in sawlog prices was primarily the result of significantly higher prices for indexed sawlogs. in the south, we harvested 1.1 million tons in the fourth quarter. this volume exceeded our expectations and was slightly higher than the seasonally strong third quarter. as eric mentioned, our southern timberlands team did a really good job making up the shortfall that occurred earlier in 2020 due to customer mill curtailments. our southern sawlog prices were 1% higher in the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter.
turning to wood products on slides 8 and 9, adjusted ebitda was $70.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $81.7 million in the third quarter. our average lumber price realizations decreased 1% from $637 per thousand board feet in the third quarter to $629 per thousand board feet in the fourth quarter. as a reminder, we had a record order file at the end of the third quarter. this move locked our lumber prices at significantly higher levels than spot prices in october. in addition, we benefited from our regional sawmill diversification as strong western dimension [phonetic] and lake state's stud prices due to the effect of the corruption in southern yellow pine lumber prices in the quarter.
to provide context, it's helpful to look at our lumber prices by month. our average lumber price realizations per thousand board feet were $711 in october; $564 in november and $575 in december. lumber shipments decreased from $291 million board feet in the third quarter to $274 million board feet in the fourth quarter. we had fewer production hours in the fourth quarter, due both to higher covid-19 infection rates in our operating communities and more holidays. the lower production hours negatively affected fixed cost absorption. higher index log costs in our idaho mills also affected margins.
moving to real estate on slides 10 and 11, the segment's adjusted ebitda was $56.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $13.4 million in the third quarter. we closed the previously announced 72,000 acre minnesota transaction in the fourth quarter. in addition residential lot sales were strong and we closed a $3.1 million commercial sale in the fourth quarter.
shifting to financial items which are summarized on slide 12, our total liquidity remained strong at $631 million. this amount includes $252 million of cash, as well as availability on our undrawn revolver. we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter. as a reminder, we have a 10b5-1 plan in place. this reflects our ability and commitment to repurchase our shares at attractive prices as part of a broader capital allocation strategy focused on increasing shareholder value over the long-term.
we refinanced $46 million of debt in december 2020. this reduced our annual interest expense run rate approximately $700,000 beginning in december. capital expenditures were $14.4 million in the fourth quarter. note that the amount i just mentioned includes real estate development expenditures, which are included in cash from operations and our cash flow statement and it excludes timberland acquisitions.
i will now provide some high level outlook comments, the details are presented on slide 13. we expect to harvest about 6 million tons in our timberland segment in 2021 with approximately 70% of the volume in the south. harvest volumes in the north are planned to be comparable in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. we expect northern sawlog prices in the first quarter to be flat, compared to record fourth quarter sawlog prices. harvest volumes and sawlog prices in the south are expected to decrease slightly in the first quarter, due primarily to seasonally less hardwood sawlogs in the mix.
we plan to ship approximately 1.1 billion board feet of lumber in 2021. in the first quarter, we plan to ship 260 million to 270 million board feet of lumber. our estimates reflect uncertainty associated with the potential for the covid-19 pandemic to continue to constrain operating hours in our sawmills.
we currently estimate that our average lumber price will be 20% to 25% higher in the first quarter. having said that recent lumber prices are more volatile than i can recall seeing in my career. as a reminder, a $10 per thousand board foot change in lumber price equals approximately $12 million of consolidated ebitda for us on an annual basis.
shifting to real estate, we expect to sell approximately 20,000 acres of rural land and approximately 145 chenal valley lots in 2021. additional real estate details are provided on the slide. our interest expense will be lower than normal in the first quarter, because that is when we receive our annual patronage payment from the farm credit banks. we estimate that interest expense will be $4 million in the first quarter and $8 million to $9 million per quarter for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. our capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million excluding acquisitions in 2021.
overall, we expect to post very strong results again in the first quarter. we anticipate total adjusted ebitda will approximate the level that we achieved in the fourth quarter, despite no repeat of the large minnesota rural land sale that we closed last quarter. we remain bullish on industry fundamentals and we believe that our integrated operating model and leveraged lumber prices are aligned with those fundamentals. we are well positioned to continue to growing shareholder value over the long-term.
that concludes our remarks. christian, i'd now like to open the call up to q&a.
",":
operator
okay, sir. [operator instructions] your first question is from ketan mamtora from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. congrats on a strong quarter. first question, maybe, i want to start off with the capital allocation priorities. you know, balance sheet is in a very good shape, your net leverage is down to 1.3 times, q1 is very strong. can talk about, sort of, what are your priorities, you touched upon m&a a little bit, but just discuss between share repurchases and m&a, how you think about it?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks. good morning, ketan. well, returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable dividend, quite frankly it's our top priority and we analyze and review capital allocation options regularly. and what i would suggest to you is that our options were generally for most likely or least likely are as follows. so, regarding the dividend we just increased to 2.5% in december, and as you know, the board typically does an in-depth review of our dividend in december of each year. so, we just hike it. so, we feel good about where the dividend is.
the next capital allocation item that we give consideration to is wood products capex. jerry mentioned in his opening remarks, we're going to spend just under $30 million on discretionary mill projects in 2021. the average return that we expect to get for those projects is 32%. so we're constantly looking for projects to invest in our mills, because they typically have very high returns. so, that's the second highest priority for capital allocation.
i would say third is m&a. we're interested in acquiring timberland, mills or a combination of the two, generally in or near our current operating areas. the one caveat is that we're only going to pursue m&a if it creates shareholder value, quite frankly like the deltic merger did. so m&a is generally third on the list.
fourth might be debt repayment. it's hard to get too excited about paying debt down today given where we're at with the historically low interest rates and frankly we've got an under-leveraged balance sheet as we sit here today.
and then the last item in terms of list of priorities is share repurchases. share repurchases are opportunistic, we want to buy low when we do repurchase shares and it seems most of the market gets that wrong. but we have to reserve cash on the balance sheet and be very opportunistic when we see a dislocation in our share price. and right now we're not buying back shares, because we think our stock is approaching nav. so does that answer your question?
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
it does. thank you. just a couple of follow-ups in that. within the discretionary capex you have in wood products, can you touch upon maybe a couple of key projects that you all are doing?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so for 2021, we've got really seven key discretionary projects that we're pursuing, again costing about $30 million. we're putting in a new stacker at our ola sawmill down in arkansas to improve production volumes, roughly 10 million feet. we've got a new auto-grader going into our bemidji mill, that's going improve grade yield and lower costs. we've got a new optimized log in-feed system going into our st. mary's mill, which is going to improve recovery and we've got a new plywood scarf line going in out of our st. mary's plywood mill that's going to improve product mix and lower costs.
so, all of these projects collectively have got that 32% return on average, but they run from -- anywhere from i think 14% on the low end, all the way up to 41% on the high end. just a great set of projects that we're really excited about.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, i was a little surprised looking at your fy '21 lumber shipment volumes 1.1, which is essentially, kind of, flat with what you had in 2020. given what we are seeing with housing is a bit of conservatism in these numbers? or maybe you want to talk about it differently. how much headroom do you have from a capacity standpoint to increase your production?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're going to -- we anticipate increasing shipments roughly 15 million to 20 million feet 2021 versus 2020. we've got a little bit of conservative built into our numbers simply, because covid is still with us and covid is costing us anywhere from 5 million to 10 million feet a quarter, but i think one of the things you have to recall is that in q4 of 2019, we did not ship well. we finished 2019 with relatively high inventories and a lot of that inventory got shipped in q1 of 2020. so, bottom line is 2020 was relatively inflated, because we shipped a lot in q1 that was produced in the prior year.
i think there is a little bit of conservatism built into our numbers. i think it's fair to say that whenever we've got margin, we're running our mills as hard as we can, running as many hours as we can. certainly that's the case today. but generally speaking, we've got an increase in shipments planned of 15 million to 20 million feet and hopefully we can beat that.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and just one last question before i turn it over. coming back to dividend, you talked about you'll increase it at the end of december, is there any change in thought around the approach to dividend given how strong cash flows are looking on the lumber side of things, and i know you've said you don't want to push it too much given there is volatility and wood products ebitda. but given how strong they are looking at right now, is there any change in approach in terms of whether there is some sort of a base load for dividend and then the remaining would be linked to ebitda from lumber.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i appreciate the question, ketan, and i would say that really has been no change in our philosophy around the dividend. as eric mentioned, our focus is on growing it sustainably over the long-term, and we always pin that dividend to our more stable part of our cash flows. when you think about lumber price driven and other volatile cash flows, that's what provides a discretionary capital that we can then go look for returns to drive shareholder value over the long-term.
so, again, dividend is based on stable cash flows and there tends to be a bit of conservatism. i think served us well through the -- early in 2021 covid pandemic first hit, our dividend was not under pressure, very comfortable level and the flip side is, we certainly have a fair bit of capital available to deploy. and as eric mentioned, he kind of walked you through our priorities and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunities to deploy that cash and put it to work to drive shareholder value for long-term.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. very helpful. i'll turn it over. good luck in 2021.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from paul quinn from rbc capital markets.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning guys. just maybe a couple of questions on your outlook. looking at the -- on the timberland side, just a flat pricing in the north. why do we expect that to be flat?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
the starting point for that flat pricing, paul, as we had record sawlog prices in the fourth quarter and then also the other element that plays into it is timing of price resets and historically it's been about a six-week lag between a move in western lumber prices and the move in our idaho sawlog pricing and certainly you're going to see that timing effect play out in the first quarter as well. so when we're flat quarter-over-quarter record prices are still really strong levels.
the other thing i will take an opportunity to point out is, in the past, we've talked about having these indexed agreements on an evergreen basis for three years. at the end of the year, we actually negotiated with key customers and those are now five year arrangements and so we've lengthened the time.
and then number two, that six-week lag that i just mentioned, now is four weeks. so you're going to see more current, more kind of frequent update in the pricing that we realize. and the other key element that i should mention as well is our logs get seasonally denser in the first quarter to the tune of about 5%. so, that's a little bit of a drag or a headwind on the quarter-over-quarter price realization comparison.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's up there and then -- maybe just on the real estate side, i see your guidance on the development sides, 50 lots in q1; 145 total. just -- i would expect that a lot -- that development lot pricing to be flat or increase over time, just seeing what we're seeing in the marketplace, but you're going from 95,000 in the first to 80,000 to 85,000. is there a mix shift in those lots that you expect to sell for the balance of the year?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
you are correct, paul, it is a mix shift. there is actually a wide range of price points that are reflected in our chenal development that range from a lower end, kind of, an entry-level portion of the project that sells at a much lower price point, all the way up to premium golf course lots. so, that's nothing more or less than just a shift in mix.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay and then just overall, i mean, you had great results. obviously, the market wasn't that impressed, your shares came up 20% in last year, but they are down 5% this year. what do you guys have to do there to compete your share price moving in the right direction?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, paul, all we can do is really focus our energy around running the business as best as we possibly can. we think we've got a phenomenal track record, we've got a great track record here of capital allocation -- smart capital allocation decisions and the stock market and stock price will take care of itself over time. so we're optimistic, the market will recognize the value in the company over time.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
alright, that's all i had. thanks guys.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, paul.
operator
your next question is from john babcock from bank of america. your line is open.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. starting just on the lumber side. i was wondering, if you might, sort of, provide your current and average realizations there?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, our current realization is about 40% higher than where we were in the fourth quarter on average, so plus 40% and our quarter-to-date pricing is up about 33%, compared to where we were in the fourth quarter.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, so you are basically expecting some taper and that's how you get to the 20% to 25% cadence?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we expect a little bit of softness in march, very hard to predict. and we've got really strong order files, pretty much out through the end of february. so we have really good insight on those prices and it's hard to know, like jerry mentioned, pricing volatility is unprecedented, but we're thinking markets could be a little soft in march.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then next question is more with regards to timberland side of things. obviously in us south prices have generally been for sawlogs pretty flat over time. and i was wondering, if you're starting to see any signs of the markets firming there? and then also if you can provide some sort of indicator, whether it's overall housing starts or any other indicator that might give us some indication of what it would take to get those markets to firm?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. unfortunately, john, we continue to see relatively flat sawlog prices in the us south and that continues to be our view going forward, at least for the foreseeable future, at least the next few years. we'll see movements from time-to-time as we saw in 2019, when wet weather constraints supply and you'll see a little bit of a lift, but it doesn't last. at times when you see a new mill open up, you might see a little bit of a lift. but again, that really doesn't last at least in our wood baskets and just the excess standing supply is so large that we think it will take a period of time for that situation to work itself out.
and to give a couple of other pieces of information and as a reminder, we're net short on sawlogs in the south, we actually consume more logs in sub-three southern sawmills then we sell off our timberlands in the region. and the other data point is recently there was f2m put out a study that suggested that across the south broadly, not just in our wood baskets that there is enough fiber available to support another 40 to 50 sawmills above and beyond what's in place today. so, just to give some anecdote, but again we think it will take time.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got you. and then just last question before i turn it over. i was just wondering, with lumber prices at historic levels right now, is this having any effect on your channel mix overall, also recognizing that the market's incredibly tight right now and [indecipherable] been making shipments as you can and as the product actually is available?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
no, i wouldn't -- i don't think it's impacting our channel mix at all. we've got a really good stable group of customers they're with us for many, many years and we continue to produce and sell to the same customer base. so i think the answer is no.
john babcock -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you. that's all i have.
operator
your next question is from kurt yinger from d.a. davidson.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. just on the mill investment side, you've outlined some high return opportunities. but i'd be interested to hear how you guys think about the potential for some larger greenfield type investments relative to acquisition opportunities. obviously, there is still uncertainty related to covid, but how should the backdrop be favorable as is the pricing environment yet? to-date, there hasn't been whole lot of new capacity announcements made. so just wanted to get your guys thoughts around the risk associated with that? and why it may not be higher on the priority list?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so we look at the economics of greenfield mill construction from time-to-time and historically we're spending our capital on discrete projects in our existing mills. so either increase production and lower costs or improve grade yield. they tend to have much higher returns and are therefore more attractive investments. in the current environment it cost roughly $650 per 1,000 unit of capacity to build a new mill. it takes about a 1.5 to get it built and then you've got operating challenges, getting the mill up and running, you've got staffing challenges, it is a very lengthy start-up curve. so, i think it's fair to say our preference is simply to go the low risk -- high return route and make incremental improvements to the existing mills versus pursuing a greenfield mill expansion.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. yes, that makes a lot of sense. alright, and then just lastly, could you just talk about how you're thinking about supply chain inventories right now? i know you talked about those being historically low, but any more color there in terms of any abnormal seasonal buying patterns you're seeing or expecting and maybe differences between some of those more r&r-oriented home center customers versus the new residential side?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, the only thing i would say is that customers are scrambling trying to procure lumber inventories that are at very, very low levels, prices ran up, as you know, in the fourth quarter -- third quarter, fourth quarter of last year, now into the first quarter. and so, nobody wants to buy lumber when it's $900 or $1,000 or 1,000 shifts [phonetic] they view it as too expensive and they think, oh, prices are going to come back down. meanwhile, you've got unprecedented demand. i mean, look at where housing starts have played out over the past couple of months, look at how strong repair and remodel markets are, home depot and lowe's are -- or the home centers of posting comps in the plus 20% to plus 30% kind of range. just really strong demand.
so i think the entire supply chain has been caught off guard without enough inventory and now we're going into, kind of, the spring season where people need to start restocking especially to treaters and everybody has been behind on buying lumber, because they think prices are going to come down. so our view is that inventories are very lean and the reason we're seeing these prices, because demand is insatiable.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it, ok. appreciate the color. and good luck here in the first quarter.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question is from buck horne from raymond james. your line is open.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning, guys. i want to follow-on kurt's question, just to add a little bit about the sawmill capacity that -- in your wood baskets are you seeing any third-party capital, any other players that are taking the opportunity to get new greenfield sawmills under way in your particular wood baskets? are you seeing any signs of that starting to pop-up?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, there have been a number of announcements here lately that are in or around our operating areas. idaho forest group announced a new mill in lumberton, mississippi. it's probably too far away from our timberlands in mississippi for us to supply them, but they have announced a new mill, beaver lumber announced a new mill in winona, mississippi. that one's frankly in our backyard, i'm sure we'll be supplying them with sawlogs as they get up and running. so there are a number of mills that are in and around our operating areas, but as jerry mentioned, these mills when they start up the initial impact is maybe a little bump in sawlog prices, but then it quickly recedes. so that's kind of how it seems to play out, just excess amount of standing timber out there.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
and i guess transitioning maybe a little higher level and i certainly want to agree with the housing outlook you guys laid out and we certainly believe that the demand should remain pretty robust throughout 2021 for single-family new home sales. so i guess part of the concern or the question is, i think there is a natural bias to be conservative that today's lumber prices, the osb prices are naturally going to taper off into year-end. but is there a scenario where -- i won't say like 900 is the new normal, but is there a scenario that we're still just being too conservative with this expectation that prices are going to meaningfully drop by year-end.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i mean that's really the million-dollar question, buck, maybe even more than a million dollars. but, so we think what's happened in the marketplace is that housing starts have really surprised to the upside here. these latest numbers the 16 million and 17 million those are really strong numbers. if those housing starts numbers stay with us through the remainder of the year, our view is that lumber prices are going to stay elevated. if they come down to where people expect housing starts to come down to say around the 14 million to 15, million kind of, range, you can see a little bit of a taper in lumber prices.
now that being said, we still think lumber prices are going to stay relatively high, especially given the covid backdrop where it's costing us in any given quarter 5 million to 10 million feet of production. take that 10 million feet across four quarters that's 40 million feet out of 1 billion board feet that we produce, that's 4%. so if everybody across the industry is having to deal with covid and it's costing them 4% of capacity, well that's going to -- that's just going to tighten industry conditions even more than it would be otherwise. so there is a scenario here where prices don't taper and certainly we're seeing that here in q1.

operator
good morning. my name is celine and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the potlatchdeltic first quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. jerry richards, vice president and chief financial officer, for opening remarks. sir, you may proceed.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. good morning and welcome to potlatchdeltic's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on the call is eric cremers, potlatchdeltic's president and chief executive officer.
this call will contain forward-looking statements. please review the warning statements in our press release, on the presentation slides and in our filings with the sec concerning the risks associated with these forward-looking statements. also, please note that a reconciliation of non-gaap measures can be found on our website at www.potlatchdeltic.com.
i'll now turn the call over to eric for some comments and then i will cover our first quarter results and our outlook.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you and good morning, everyone. the year is off to an extraordinary start, which is saying a lot given our incredible financial performance last year.
consolidated ebitdda was $195 million in the first quarter of 2021, which is our third consecutive quarter of record financial performance. all three of our business units performed well in the quarter. our wood products segment generated a record $126 million of ebitdda in the first quarter. to put that amount in perspective, wood products earned nearly as much in the first quarter as it did in all of last year. our employees did an excellent job and remain focused on meeting our customers' needs safely despite challenges presented by extreme winter weather in the south and lingering effects of the covid pandemic.
our timberland segment's ebitdda of $68 million was also a quarterly record. the performance highlights the value being added by our indexed idaho sawlog sales contracts which are unique in the industry. our idaho team took advantage of favorable logging conditions to capture prices that remain near record levels and our southern team did a good job mitigating the effects of extreme winter weather on harvest volumes.
our real estate segment also had a strong quarter as demand for rural and development land remains robust. and in our chenal valley master planned community in little rock, arkansas, we raised residential lot prices approximately 10% and still sold 51 residential lots in q1 along with completing a $3 million commercial sale. in idaho, our real estate team has done a magnificent job capitalizing on the surge in demand for rural acreage. our team is creating small rural lots for sale about 10 acres to 20 acres in size and we expect to sell about 40 of these of lots this year for about $5 million at a price that is multiples of the underlying timber value.
looking ahead, we expect housing fundamentals will remain very strong. u.s. housing starts increased to just over 1.7 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in march, which is the highest level since june of 2006. total permits remained above 1.7 million units, which is well above consensus expectations of about 1.5 million units for the year.
on a macro level, the stage for robust housing demand was set by massive underbuilding since the great financial crisis, record low inventories of homes for sale, historically low mortgage rates and millennials entering their prime homebuying years. on the first point, freddie mac recently stated that the shortage of u.s. single-family homes has grown to 3.8 million units. these factors all suggest that housing construction will remain very active for the foreseeable future.
the repair and remodel market, which represents about 40% of lumber demand, is also expected to continue to grow. key drivers include the age of u.s. housing stock, which is now around 42 years on average, high and increasing levels of home equity and the work-from-home trend. positive demand signals include recent commentary from the big box home supply stores like home depot and lowe's, the harvard joint center for housing studies and the national association of homebuilders remodeling market index, which hit a new high in the first quarter. it has been challenging for the industry to catch up to stronger-than-expected lumber demand. this is evidenced by lumber inventories that remain at historically low levels despite lumber production remaining at its highest levels since the great financial crisis.
truck and rail transportation bottlenecks may also play a role, particularly as we head into produce season in the south. absent a significant increase in mortgage rates or a covid resurgence, it is hard to imagine what could cause lumber demand to drop and prices to moderate in the foreseeable future. our leverage to lumber strategy is perfectly situated to continue to drive strong financial performance for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
turning to capital allocation. returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority. we are positioned well for our board to consider distributions beyond our current annual dividend of $1.64 per share per year. this discussion typically occurs at our december board meeting each year. our strong balance sheet and $761 million of liquidity provide a solid platform as we consider additional investments in our existing mills or accretive acquisitions. we are interested in acquiring timberlands, mills or a combination of the two near our current operating areas.
we are excited to publish our second environmental, social and governance report in the coming weeks, which will add disclosures of scope 2 greenhouse gases, expanded information about our carbon sequestration and storage and climate-related analysis. potlatchdeltic is a leader in sustainable forest management and we are committed to environmental and social responsibility and to responsible governance.
to wrap up my comments, potlatchdeltic is very well positioned to take advantage of favorable industry fundamentals and our strong liquidity and prudent capital allocation strategy positions us to continue increasing shareholder value.
i'll turn it over to jerry to discuss first quarter results and our outlook. jerry?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, eric. starting with page 4 of the slides, adjusted ebitdda increased from $164 million in the fourth quarter to $195 million in the first quarter. this is the third quarter in a row that we have set a new quarterly ebitdda record and we have generated $530 million of ebitdda over the last 12 months. the effect of higher lumber prices more than offset the 72,000 acre minnesota land sale completed in the fourth quarter, seasonally lower harvest volumes and lower lumber shipments.
i will now review each of our operating segments and provide more color on the first quarter results. information for our timberland segment is displayed on slides 5 through 7. the segment's adjusted ebitdda increased from $63 million in the fourth quarter to $68 million in the first quarter. our team leveraged good logging conditions and strong markets to harvest 427,000 tons of sawlogs in the north in the first quarter. this volume is higher than the 378,000 tons that we harvested in the fourth quarter.
northern sawlog prices were 1% lower on a per ton basis in the first quarter compared to the record fourth quarter price. higher sawlog prices mostly offset the negative effects of seasonally heavier sawlogs and the timing of price resets on the indexed volume. for example, index prices were at their lowest recent point in january and sawlog shipment seized mid-march with the onset of spring breakup right as lumber prices were surging.
in the south, we harvested 893,000 tons in the first quarter. as eric mentioned, our southern timberlands team did a really good job making up most of the shortfall caused by extreme winter weather in february. our southern sawlog prices were 1% lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower hardwood volumes in the mix.
turning to wood products on slides 8 and 9. adjusted ebitdda increased from $70 million in the fourth quarter to $126 million in the first quarter. this is a new quarterly ebitdda record for the segment. our average lumber price realization increased 41% from $629 per 1,000 board feet in the fourth quarter to $890 per 1,000 board feet in the first quarter. to provide context, it's helpful to look at our lumber prices by month. our average lumber price realizations per 1,000 board feet increased from $817 in january to $880 in february and to $961 in march.
lumber shipments decreased from 274 million board feet in the fourth quarter to 258 million board feet in the first quarter. we lost a week of production at our three arkansas sawmills due to the winter storm that hit texas and arkansas in february. we also had planned maintenance downtime during the quarter. the lower production hours negatively affected fixed cost absorption. higher index log costs in our idaho mills also affected margins.
moving to real estate on slides 10 and 11. the segment's adjusted ebitdda was $17 million in the first quarter compared to $57 million in the fourth quarter. as a reminder, fourth quarter included a 72,000 acre minnesota transaction for nearly $48 million.
shifting to financial items, which are summarized on slide 12. our total liquidity increased to $761 million. this amount includes $382 million of cash as well as availability on our undrawn revolver. we did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter. as a reminder, we have a 10b5-1 plan in place. this reflects our ability and commitment to repurchase our shares at attractive prices as part of a broader capital allocation strategy focused on increasing shareholder value over the long-term.
capital expenditures were $14 million in the first quarter. note that the amount i just mentioned includes real estate development expenditures, which are included in cash from operations in our cash flow statement and excludes timberland acquisitions. we continue to expect that our total capital expenditures will be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, excluding acquisitions, in 2021.
i will now provide some high level outlook comments. the details are presented on slide 13. we expect to harvest 1.1 million to 1.3 million tons in our timberland segments in the second quarter. harvest volumes in the north are planned to be seasonally lower due to spring breakup. we expect northern sawlog prices to increase in the second quarter due primarily to higher index sawlog prices. harvest volumes and sawlog prices in the south are expected to be comparable to the first quarter.
our lumber order file is currently three to four weeks depending on mill. our average lumber price thus far in the second quarter, including orders booked but not yet shipped, is approximately 18% higher than our first quarter lumber price. as a reminder, a $10 per 1,000 board foot change in lumber price equals approximately $12 million of consolidated ebitdda for us on an annual basis. we plan to ship 275 million to 285 million board feet of lumber in the second quarter.
shifting to real estate. we expect to sell approximately 2,500 acres of rural land and approximately 15 chenal valley lots in the second quarter. lot demand remains strong, but there will be a pause in the second quarter as builders digest recent lot purchases. we continue to expect to sell approximately 145 lots for the year. additional real estate details are provided on the slide.
corporate expense is expected to be higher than the typical level in the second quarter, primarily due to bonus accruals related to our strong results. for the year, we expect corporate expense to be $45 million to $50 million. we also expect our consolidated tax rate will be approximately 20% in the second quarter and for the full year. overall, we anticipate second quarter total adjusted ebitdda will be higher than the first quarter, which would establish a fourth consecutive new quarterly record for the company.
we remain very bullish on industry fundamentals and we believe that our integrated operating model and leverage to lumber prices are aligned with those fundamentals. we are well positioned to continue growing shareholder value over the long-term.
that concludes our prepared remarks. celine, we would now like to open the call to q&a.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we have our first question coming from the line of ketan mamtora with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. and good afternoon or good morning over there. congrats on a very strong quarter. maybe first question, probably start off with the capital allocation priorities. eric, you alluded to it in your prepared remarks around kind of distributions beyond your regular dividend. and recognizing you don't want to jump before the board, but i mean, what are the different options on the table as you think about these distributions, is it more like a special dividend? are you thinking about kind of a variable two-tier dividend? perhaps any thoughts will be helpful.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, ketan, good morning or afternoon, i guess, depending upon where you are. yeah, the dividend is an important issue. we've got a history of raising our dividend on a sustainable basis slowly but surely over time and we've increased that dividend 30% since 2012 on a per share basis, including the recent 2.5% increase in q4. so we're very mindful not to let the cart get ahead of the horse here. slow and sustainable is a strategy that we want to employ here. we're just beginning to have those conversations with our board. so it's probably a little bit premature as to what that dividend increase might look like later in the year, but certainly it's something we'll be exploring along with all the other capital allocation opportunities that we have. so, i guess, to answer your question, it's still a little bit of to be determined.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
understood. so, is it fair to then say that, at this point, the way you are thinking about it is still kind of an increase in regular dividend but not kind of considering things like a special dividend or a variable dividend, is that a fair characterization?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
no, i don't -- i wouldn't go that far. i would say, we're exploring it, the notion of a steady increase to the dividend, but we're also going to have to think about the extraordinary amount of earnings that we're making in our reit right now may force us into a larger dividend distribution than we're used to. so, it's still early in the year and we really haven't gotten into those discussions yet with our board. so, it's too soon to say how it's going to play out.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
understood. and eric or jerry, is there a way to think about sort of what is the kind of cash cushion you want to build? i mean, obviously we are in extraordinary times given how strong lumber prices are and your unique positioning with idaho log prices. you already kind of just 0.7 times levered, by the end of q2 you may be less than 0.5 times levered. how do you think about kind of having that cash cushion?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
good afternoon. ketan. this is jerry. so in terms of a cash cushion. i mean, one, as you know, we tend to manage the balance sheet fairly conservatively. now having said that, with cash generation really haven't kicked into gear with these higher lumber prices, we're accumulating cash well beyond any sort of cushion that we normally would want to hold through a cycle. and what that does is, it creates certainly opportunities, as eric mentioned, to think about a full suite of capital allocation opportunities and priorities to drive shareholder value.
but to answer your specific question, we like to hold enough cash to make sure that we can opportunistically buy shares and that tends to happen when business conditions aren't very good. just like a year ago, in march, we were actively buying shares when markets panicked over covid. and fortunately, we had that -- that strong balance sheet allowed us to go take advantage of that opportunity. so there is a base level. it's certainly not $382 million, it's something that's probably well below $382 million.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
understood. okay, that's helpful. and then, is there any change in thinking around kind of build versus buy for sawmills?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, we look at the economics of greenfield mill construction from time to time. and frankly, ketan, historically spending our capital on discrete projects in our existing mills, that's true whether they increase production or lower costs or improved grade yield, those projects tend to have higher returns and are therefore more attractive than the greenfield option.
in the current environment, it costs around $700, 1,000 of capacity to build a new mill and it takes about two years to get it built. so, in addition to their staffing challenges and there is a lengthy start-up curve. so, i think to answer your question, we're going to continue to explore and think about the idea of a greenfield mill, but frankly our preference is to go the low risk route that's proven very successful for us and make incremental improvements to our existing mills.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. so, on the same theme, eric, what is it that you could potentially produce this year at your sawmills if demand were to remain strong and if your customers asking for it?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
when you say what could our mills produce in terms of volume or...?
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes, sorry. yeah, in terms of volume.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, this year, we're probably looking ketan at about, i don't know, a 2% increase in volumes compared to last year, about 20 million feet. we've got a history here over the last several years of increasing production and shipments anywhere from 1% to 4% per year just depending upon the timing of capital projects and weather events and things like that. last year we got hit with covid that impacted production 3% to 4%. well, now, this year we're lapping that which is great news. we're not having big impacts from covid. but on the other hand, we just had a storm hit in texas and arkansas that set us back 10 million feet. but i think over the long haul, you'll see us increase our shipments this 1% to 4% range or like this year it's going to be about 2%.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. very helpful. i'll jump back in the queue. good luck for the rest of the year.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.

we have our next question coming from the line of john babcock with bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
cissy guan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. everyone, this is cissy guan [phonetic] sitting in for john babcock today. just kind of returning to the discussion on the outlook for the rest of the year. just wanted to get your take on kind of the current view of how you expect the lumber market to play out in the balance of the year and then relatedly how are inventories in the channel right now versus how they were at the end of the quarter?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
i'll answer the second one first, which is that inventories are at absolute rock bottom levels, just -- it's incredible. i can tell you a story about a fence that blew down in my backyard and my landscape construction guy had to drive 100 miles outside of town to find new fence post to put in. but anyway, inventories are incredibly low levels. so, back to the first part of your question on lumber prices. our q2 lumber prices to date, as jerry mentioned, they are about 18% higher than q1 based on shipments and prices included in our order files that stretch into late may at this point. and prices, frankly, have continued to increase the last couple of weeks. i think our spot prices are may be up 19% today compared to where we finished q1.
so, the full year -- for the full year demand indicators, they're expected to remain strong both for new homes and for repair and remodel market segments. builders are reporting record home sales and they're going to need that wood to build those homes. in addition, as i just mentioned, field lumber inventories remain at historically low levels. so, as we talked about, absent an unexpected large increase in mortgage rates or resurgence in covid, it's just hard to imagine what could cause lumber prices to correct in the foreseeable future.
in fact, risi just raise their 2021 north america lumber demand by 1.3 billion board feet in their april forecast compared to the march forecast and it's now expected to be 3.3 billion board feet higher that is demand than last year. so we think we're in unprecedented territory here and risi's recent price forecast for full year prices to average just about $1,000 doesn't seem out of the realm of realistic.
cissy guan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. good luck in the quarter.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
we have our next question coming from the line of mark weintraub with seaport global. your line is open.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
thank you. congrats on a third great quarter. eric, i'm sure you are enjoying the ceo role here. so, firstly, the timberland acquisition pipeline, can you give us some color on what you're seeing and whether there's been any change in the pipeline in the last six, 12 months?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, mark. we've seen a market increase in m&a opportunities in the timberland space. last year was -- there was a dearth of deals to be done. with covid, people couldn't get out and travel, was hard to kick the tires on stuff. and so, very little activity last year. and i would say, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, activity started to pick up. we started to hear things and now as we get into the first quarter and the second quarter, activity is really picking up.
we're looking at about five different deals right now and we missed one in south alabama, somebody paid a little bit more than we were willing to pay. but we're optimistic of those five deals that we're looking at that we're going to get one or perhaps two of them done remains to be seen. but i can assure you of one thing, which is we're not going to do a transaction unless it creates shareholder value. each one of our deals, we will determine what's fair price that creates value and we will draw the line at that price. and that's how we missed that one in south alabama.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
understood. and are you seeing any change in the way folks are thinking about pricing timberlands? and kind of relatedly, is there any sign yet of this remarkable run in lumber in the u.s. south, in particular, translating into higher timber pricing and/or -- any color on your thoughts as to if and when that might happen?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes, mark. so those log prices in the south, they have just been flat for over a decade now. and every time maybe there's a weather event, maybe there's a mill start-up that kicks prices up a buck or two, but it quickly recedes. so we're seeing no price tension in logs across the south for any measurable period of time. when do i think that could change or what could cause that to change? we obviously we need -- there needs to be more capacity in u.s. south to put more pressure on timber inventories. i think the data that i see suggests that timber inventories in the south won't peak for another four to five years. and there is more mill construction, there's more steel going up in the south for sure, which will eat into that timber inventory. but they're still not supposed to peak for yet another four or five years, so they continue to increase every year.
so, i think, maybe at that point in time, there could be a little bit of price pressure. but for how long can you have a disparity, $45 sawlogs in the south and $160 sawlogs in the pacific northwest. that is just a huge, a huge gap. and that's going to continue to drive new capacity in the south. so i guess to answer your question is we're not seeing any price tension in the south, and maybe they'll start change in four or five years.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
great. and then that first part on timberland valuations themselves, obviously, not seeing much in timber. are discount rates changing or anything like that, or the price levels you're seeing for timberland is pretty similar to what they had been?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, mark. i would say, if you look at the history of southern timberland prices, which is where the majority of the activity is, it's been about $1,800, $1,850 an acre over the last decade hasn't really changed a whole lot. and that's probably consistent with prices not changing a lot. so i don't think people are really thinking about the different ways of evaluating that ground. it's based on the same $45 to $50 of ebitdda per acre and you do the math, you wind up at $1,850 an acre.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. good luck with the coming quarter.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
we have our next question coming from the line of kurt yinger with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
kurt yinger -- da davidson -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning, eric and jerry.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
kurt yinger -- da davidson -- analyst
so you started the year, i think, pointing to flattish kind of harvest volumes, it looks like in q1, you ran a little bit ahead of schedule. but if we kind of factor in the q2 guide, it seems like you've got to make up some ground versus last year to get there. so could you maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the full-year harvest plan at this stage and what factors kind of might impact that going forward?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. good morning, kurt. so in terms of full-year harvest levels, i'll start by saying; we still plan to harvest about 6 million tons for the year. and as you noted, we got a bit ahead in idaho, we had favorable conditions and good markets in q1. so, we got off to a really good start in idaho and ultimately made up some good ground in the south. so we were pleased with the harvest levels for q1.
but to get to your question in terms of how the year plays out, if you look at our guide at 1.1 million to 1.3 million tons, i would suggest that year-on-year, we're down about 100,000 tons. and some things to lay out there on q2, one, idaho probably looks the same year-on-year, so the decline really is in the south. and when you go back to last year, a key part of that reason why the south is down this year versus last year is timing of stumpage contracts. so some of those push out later in the year. the other dynamic that we had is coming out of the -- kind of the covid pandemic window in the quarter; sawlog demand was extraordinarily strong last year. so sawlogs are probably a bit higher than our plan in q2 of 2020. so you'll see something that's more normal this year.
and then, a partial offset is pulpwood demand was really weak last year. and in fact, we ended up guiding that we were going to be down for the year because of shortage of pulpwood due to mill outages. so you probably have a little bit of an offset there in q2 of this year. and then, when you roll that to get to 6 million ton harvest level for the year, that suggests that when you think about q3 in particular, which is our best seasonal quarter typically, ends up being a pretty robust q3 versus last year.
kurt yinger -- da davidson -- analyst
got it, ok. that's helpful color. i appreciate that. and then, just on the cost side, could you talk about any inflationary pressures you're seeing within wood products in timberlands that are kind of worth calling out. and then, i guess remind us for wood products, specifically how we should be, i guess, thinking about or handicapping the cost impact from those higher sawlog prices in idaho?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll take the first part and then jerry will take the second part. on the cost inflation and wood products, i mean i would say the biggest thing that we've got our eye on right now are transportation issues. we're managing through that right now. but our rail and truck transportation is getting increasingly challenging to find and we're having to pay more for it. usually this happens to us in the south in the summertime when the produce crop is moving, but it's happening earlier this year.
now, we've still been able to pass those costs through, it's not significant, it's not material. but we've got over -- we've certainly got our eye on it. and i would say, that's really the only real cost pressure that we're seeing at this point. jerry, you want to talk about log prices?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. you bet. so in terms of log prices in idaho and that cost pressure, i mean, we provided really good insight on kind of log prices with our timberland segment in idaho. and to put in context, year-ago log prices were running at about $100 a ton whereas q1, we just reported $178 per ton and moving up from there in q2. so that provides kind of the price part of that equation.
and the other important part from a modeling standpoint is about 40% of our harvest in idaho goes into our no complex, so that will give you the proportion of kind of the volume the defects. so now you have both sides of that equation. so it's a pretty significant lift from a cost standpoint. the important thing is to keep in mind that again only 40% of those logs go to our complex. and so, there is another 60% in the timberlands segment that we're certainly benefiting from these high price have dropped to the bottom line.
kurt yinger -- da davidson -- analyst
great, great. okay. yeah, that's helpful. all right. and then, i guess, my last one, i guess started to see some anecdotes about southern yellow pine kind of shifting further out as a substitute for, i guess, products coming out of canada [phonetic] and other western b.c., could you just talk about some of the dynamics there and what significance, if any, you think that could have for the market going forward?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, your observation is correct. recently western spf is trading at a premium to southern yellow pine. that's a bit of an anomaly. from a historical standpoint, usually southern yellow pine tends to trade at a premium. but i think with all those mill closures that have happened up in b.c. and now we're getting into kind of the spring summer months when building activity in the north and the west really starts to pick-up, those high western spf prices are causing builders to substitute with southern yellow pine. so southern yellow pine's reach is probably as far as it has ever been and, i mean, this really should come as no surprise to anybody. if you think about like again getting back to those $45 logs in the south compared to $150, $160 whatever a ton in the north and the west.
southern lumber production as a percent of north american production has now increased over the past 10, 12 years from roughly 26% market share now all the way up to 35%. meanwhile, b.c. has gone from 20% -- which is of course western spf producing region, has gone from 25% down to 15%. so, yes, southern yellow pine is slowly moving across the country in the farther territory than it has previously and i frankly expect that trend to continue.
kurt yinger -- da davidson -- analyst
got it, got it. appreciate that, eric. all right. well, thanks for all the details and good luck here in q2 guys.
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer

thanks. thanks. we have our next question coming from the line of buck horne with raymond james. your line is open.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. quick question, just maybe explain in just more color maybe reexplain it, if you will. understanding the latency of how the idaho indexed log contracts in terms of your price realizations for those, how they track, what's happening in the spot market for lumber prices, of course northern pricing in the first quarter was kind of flattish versus the fourth quarter. so how does that set up for the remainder of the year in terms of how we could think about how current lumber price conditions will affect the timing of the realization on those contracts?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, buck. so, in terms of -- the most important thing to keep in mind in terms of those idaho lndexed log prices is, the price gets reset on about a four-week lag. so when you see a reported lumber price today, that won't show up until -- in the form of sawlog price until about four weeks later. so that's probably the most important thing. and in fact, when we take the random links lumber composite and we offset it by a quarter or by a month, excuse me, the pattern of the -- and the kind of the slope of the line looks very similar to what's happened in our idaho sawlog. so that's probably the most important thing in terms of modeling.
and then certainly we have density. so, in the winter, logs absorb more water. they're heavier, customers don't pay us for water. so they reported price per ton will go down in that season. so, generally in q1, you see about a 5% headwind in terms of the density factor, q2 that turns around as a bit of a positive. and then, probably the other third thing to keep in mind is cedar. so cedar is normally about a sawlog that's worth probably 3 times a normal mix sawlog. so kind of a mix the volume of cedar in the mix is usually other factor. but most important of all those is to kind of take that lumber price -- reported lumber price and lag it by about a month.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and last thought for us -- thought was with the excess cash and understand you got the 10b5-1 plan in place for stock repurchases now. but with this extra buffer that you've got in place now, do you think that there is an opportunity to maybe establish some programmatic or more consistent level of stock repurchases to the capital allocation plan?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that one as well, buck. our strategy around share repurchase has really been more opportunistic. as i mentioned a bit earlier in the call, about a year-ago when our stock price got down to the $30 per share and below level, my eyes got big and we started aggressively buying shares. so we tend to look at it, we have a strong view and conviction on our -- what we think the intrinsic value of this company is and really look for a wide discount. and the reason for that is, we have a number of investment opportunities to think about. certainly we've talked about mill capex, discretionary projects can generate returns north of 30%. so that's pretty attractive.
you've heard eric talk about earlier in this call how we're excited about some of the opportunities, the m&a opportunities that we're looking at. and if we can grow shareholder value through that at an attractive level, then that certainly makes sense.
and then, i heard ketan's question is around kind of dividend and how we're thinking about that. so we have a number of options to think about. and i would not expect that we move to a programmatic approach. i think we will stick to opportunistic share repurchases. and that's really because it all goes back to overall strategy, which is we want to grow shareholder value as much as we can over time. and we think the opportunistic approach is much better suited to fulfill that leg of the strategy than doing something programmatic.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
very helpful. thank you, guys.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
we have our last question coming from the line of paul quinn with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thanks very much, guys. great quarter but it's exactly we're going to see a lot of that in this range. maybe i'll start with eric on the m&a, the five deals that you're currently looking at right now and you're simply pretty bullish on it, what -- any of these deals include sawmills?
eric cremers -- president and chief executive officer
i don't want to get too down into the weeds, paul, but yes.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then, just back to capital allocation because i'm a little confused there. i mean, the share price at potlach spent most of the quarter around the $50 mark; you're over $60 here, just wondering why you didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, paul, it goes back to, i mean, the answer to the buck's question is, we tend to be very optimistic. there's no question that nav and intrinsic value moves up. i mean, every load of lumber we ship today is creating value. and we certainly have accumulated a lot of cash on the balance sheet, which is obviously adding value when you think about this company and market cap, etc. but it really comes down to the other -- we have all kinds of -- we have other alternatives in using that cash.
and like i said, at the end of the day, we're very excited about the m&a opportunities, good mill capex returns, etc. so -- and there's nothing to be gained by doing things aggressively or quickly as well, as proven last year, we held some cash. and we took advantage of that in march and bought our shares, kind of around the $30 level. so, at the end of the day, $50 certainly on hindsight looks like a steep discount to today. but again, we take the long-term view here, and we tend to be more of a deep value type investor when it comes to buying our shares.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then, if i could flip it over on to the dividend, the options around that, i mean, i can understand not trying to get too far ahead of your skis and have that slow, steady approach to the annual, but would you also can consider, i mean, some of your peers have looked at and warehouses doing a supplemental dividend, just given the extraordinary nature of the cash flow that you'll generate this year. i mean, you're obviously pointing to a record q2 off the record q1 herein and the balance of the year, given your commentary is also very bullish?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, paul, i mean, i think we're going to have to take a closer look at the dividend. as you know, our dividend, it's a very important part of our proposition to our investors to return capital to them. we're not going to waste this capital that we've generated. and we got really three different tools as i think about capital allocation, it's either the dividend, it's wood products capex or it's m&a, unless our shares collapse, which that's not going to happen anytime soon or it's highly unlikely to happen anytime soon, it's going to be hard for us to buy back shares. we're not going to pay down debt, we're already way under levered as is. so that doesn't seem viable. so it's those first three alternatives. and the dividend certainly is at the top of the list. so we'll be looking at the dividend very closely as we move through the year, but nothing is likely to get announced until we get to q4.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
why is that just in the timing, i mean, i understand from a historical perspective that i mean, you've just got cash is building up on the balance sheet at a pretty rapid rate here. it sounds reasonable to be able to signal to investors a little bit earlier that, this is what we intend to do with the cash balance?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, this industry can be volatile at times, things can go up, things can go down, i don't expect things to go down. we're as bullish as we are. i've been with this company for 14 years. i've never been as bullish as i am today. and we've just got a track record of doing our analysis as we move through the year and it culminates in a in-depth discussion to the board in december. and i'm sure we're going to be talking to the board about this as we move through this year and with more energy and enthusiasm than we have in prior years. but given the volatile nature of the industry, we're probably going to wait until the end of the year to decide what to do. but that remains to be seen too. it's really a board level decision.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right, fair enough. i look forward to the q2 results. thanks.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer

operator
good morning. my name is may, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the potlatchdeltic second quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you.
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. jerry richards, vice president and chief financial officer for opening remarks. sir, you may proceed.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
all right, thank you, may, and good morning and welcome to potlatchdeltic's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on the call is eric cremers, potlatchdeltic's president and chief executive officer. this call will contain forward-looking statements. please review the warning statements in our press release, on the presentation slides and in our filings with the sec concerning the risks associated with these forward-looking statements. also please note that a reconciliation of non-gaap measures can be found on our website at www.potlatchdeltic.com.
i'll now turn the call over to eric for some comments and then i will cover our second quarter results and our outlook.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jerry. lumber prices continued their historic run in the second quarter, driving another quarter of record financial performance for the company. our consolidated ebitdda was $275 million in q2, which is our fourth consecutive quarter record financial performance. our wood products segment generated $205 million of ebitdda in the second quarter. to provide context, this amount exceeded wood products ebitdda for full-year 2020, which was an annual record itself.
as previously announced, we had a fire at our ola, arkansas sawmill on june 13. fortunately, nobody was injured and the damage was limited to just the large log primary breakdown machine center. insurance will cover the cost of restoring operations at the mill along with lost profits above a $2 million deductible. our team is actively working on demolition and equipment replacement options. although we have not yet finalized our plans, we are working on restarting the large log line as soon as possible, potentially in late q1 of next year.
it is premature to commit to that schedule as we have not yet finalized the purchase of a replacement line. as a reminder, ola had an annual capacity of 150 million board feet prior to the fire. our plywood business continues to perform exceptionally well and we expect record profitability from this business this year. as we have discussed on prior calls, our industrial-grade plywood is used in big ticket boats, rvs, truck trailers and furniture. demand for these items remains very strong.
our timberland segment earned record ebitdda of $77 million in the second quarter, despite idaho harvest volumes being at their seasonal low point due to spring breakup. our average sawlog price of $245 per ton in idaho highlights the value being created by our indexed sawlog sales contracts, which are unique in the industry. our idaho team did a great job exceeding the harvest plan in the first half of the year, realizing attractive sawlog prices and reducing the risk of not meeting our annual harvest plan because of high fire danger.
our southern team did a good job managing through extraordinarily wet weather during the second quarter after dealing with extreme winter weather in the first quarter. we expect that our southern harvest will be approximately 200,000 tons below our annual harvest plan primarily due to the ola sawmill fire. our real estate segment's ebitdda declined in the second quarter as expected, as homebuilders digested over 120 chenal valley lots purchased in the prior two quarters. demand in chenal remains strong, as evidenced by lot draws thus far in the third quarter, and we continue to see good interest in commercial and rural acreage.
turning to lumber prices, we believe that the steep decline in lumber prices that occurred over the last nine weeks has reached the bottom. psychology most certainly has played a role over the past couple of months, and it is not uncommon for lumber prices to overshoot on the upside, as well as the downside. peak western spf price of $1,630 per thousand board feet reported by random lengths for 2 and better 2x4s [phonetic] in may was not sustainable.
reports of lower home center lumber demand appears to be a key factor that triggered the price decline. lumber futures led cash prices down and the july contract settled at $650 per thousand board feet. while the market tone shifted last week, random lengths reported at the price of 2 and better 2x4s increased $55 per thousand board feet in the second half of the week, which is the first increase in nearly nine weeks. random lengths also reported that downward pressure in other western species of lumber and southern yellow pine eased late last week.
nobody wanted to catch a falling knife during the lumber price correction. we believe that reports of sawmill curtailments provided comfort to lumber buyers that their downside risk was limited at current lumber price levels. as a result, lumber futures moved up sharply at the end of last week. the various contracts are in the $600 per thousand board foot range, which suggests that lumber prices could bounce nicely as liquidity returns to the market and lumber buyers replenish lean inventories.
housing-related fundamentals that drive our business remain robust, and fea stated that new residential construction is quote, on the cusp of a multi-year boom in a recent set of slides, frankly, we agree. on the demand side, new residential construction remained strong with june starts at 1.64 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, permits of 1.6 million units are 23% higher than the prior year, as well as the 50-year average of 1.5 million units. we expect new residential construction will remain very strong due to massive under-building since the great financial crisis, record low inventories of home for sale, historically low mortgage rates and millennials entering their prime homebuying years.
on that first point, freddie mac estimates that the shortage of u.s. single-family homes is 3.8 million units, and the national association of realtors estimates that the u.s. is under-built by 5 million units to 6 million units. d. r. horton stated on their earnings call last week that demand remains quote, extremely robust, and quote, unlike anything we've ever seen. lumber demand in the repair and remodel market declined after memorial day as people reacted to high lumber prices that had turned into front-page news.
return to work and discretionary spending, shifting to leisure activities likely also played a role. long-term fundamentals in this segment remain positive, including the age of the u.s. housing stock, which is now 42 years on average, high levels of home equity and the fact that remote work continues to be a common practice. industry economists expect lumber demand in the repair and remodel segment to continue to grow and demand has likely just been deferred, not destroyed.
on the supply side, higher costs, the tight labor market and equipment supplier bottlenecks govern the pace of new lumber capacity. wildfires across the west and the shortage of truck drivers may also create constraints in the near-term. overall, the fundamentals that drive our business remain favorable and we continue to expect that lumber prices will settle at relatively attractive levels. our leverage to lumber strategy is perfectly situated to continue to drive strong financial performance for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
turning to capital allocation, returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority. we continue to expect that we will pay a meaningful special dividend in the fourth quarter. in addition, our board typically evaluates our regular annual dividend, which is currently $1.64 per share in december. our strong balance sheet and $891 million of liquidity provide a solid platform, as we consider additional investments in our existing mills or accretive acquisitions. we're interested in acquiring timberlands, mills or a combination of the two near our current operating areas. we published our second environmental, social and governance report in may and the report is available on our website.
highlights include disclosures of scope 2 greenhouse gases, expanded information about our carbon sequestration and storage and climate-related analysis. potlatchdeltic is a leader in sustainable forest management and we are committed to environmental and social responsibility and responsible governance. to wrap up my comments, potlatchdeltic is very well positioned to take advantage of favorable industry fundamentals and our strong liquidity and prudent capital allocation strategy positions us to continue increasing shareholder value.
i'll now turn it over to jerry to discuss second quarter results and our outlook.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, eric. starting with page 4 of the slides, our adjusted ebitdda increased from $195 million in the first quarter to $275 million in the second quarter. this is our fourth quarterly ebitdda record in a row, and we have generated $769 million of ebitdda over the last 12 months. the effect of higher lumber prices more than offset seasonally lower harvest volumes in the second quarter. information for our timberland segment is displayed on slides 5 through 7. the segment's adjusted ebitdda increased from $68 million in the first quarter to $77 million in the second quarter.
our team leveraged good logging conditions and strong markets to harvest 354,000 tons of sawlogs in the north in the second quarter. this volume is seasonally lower than the 427,000 tons that we harvested in the first quarter due to typical spring breakup. northern sawlog prices increased from $178 per ton in the first quarter to a record $245 per ton in the second quarter or 38%. lumber indexed and cedar sawlogs both experienced healthy price increases. in the south, we harvested 876,000 tons in the second quarter compared to 893,000 tons in the first quarter. logging activity was constrained by wet weather. our southern sawlog prices were flat sequentially.
turning to wood products on slides 8 and 9, adjusted ebitdda increased from $126 million in the first quarter to $205 million in the second quarter. this is another quarterly ebitdda record for the segment. our average lumber price realizations increased 33% from $890 per thousand board feet in the first quarter to $1,185 per thousand board feet in the second quarter. to provide context, it's helpful to look at our lumber prices by month. our average lumber price realizations per thousand board feet increased from $1,045 in april to $1,218 in may, and finally to $1,280 in june.
we shipped 260 [phonetic] million board feet of lumber in the second quarter. while this was approximately 7% below our expectations, our team did a good job managing a drop in home center demand after memorial day and truck and rail transportation challenges to limit the shortfall. also as eric discussed earlier, our ola, arkansas sawmill has not been operating since the fire occurred on june 13, reducing our production.
moving to real estate on slides 10 and 11, the segment's adjusted ebitdda was $12 million in the second quarter compared to $17 million in the first quarter. the sequential decline reflects a $3 million commercial real estate sale completed in the first quarter and fewer chenal valley lot sales in the second quarter, but the latter was expected as builders were digesting robust lot purchases that were completed in the prior two quarters.
shifting to financial items, which are summarized on slide 12, our total liquidity increased to $891 million. this amount includes $512 million of cash, as well as availability on our undrawn revolver. we did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter. as a reminder, we have a 10b5-1 plan in place, which reflects our ability and commitment to repurchase our shares at attractive prices. capital expenditures were $14 million in the second quarter. note that the amount i just mentioned includes real estate development expenditures, which are included in cash from operations in our cash flow statement and it excludes timberland acquisitions.
we expect that our total capital expenditures will be approximately $60 million in 2021, excluding acquisitions. planned 2021 capital expenditure -- expenditures will also exclude costs to replace equipment damage in the ola sawmill fire that we expect will largely be covered by insurance. i will now provide some high level outlook comments, the details are presented on slide 13. we expect to harvest 1.5 million tons to 1.7 million tons in our timberland segment in the third quarter and approximately 5.7 million tons for the full-year. as eric mentioned, our southern harvest will be lower than planned this year because it is uneconomic to redirect logs that would have been consumed by our ola, arkansas sawmill.
harvest volumes in the north are planned to be seasonally higher in the third quarter. fire danger is very high in idaho, which may constrain logging in the quarter. we expect northern sawlog prices to be lower in the third quarter and that they will approximate first quarter 2021 sawlog prices. harvest volumes and sawlog prices in the south are expected to be seasonally higher in the third quarter. our lumber order file is currently prompt to two weeks depending on the mill.
our average lumber price thus far in the third quarter including orders booked, but not yet shipped is approximately 50% lower than our average second quarter lumber price. as a reminder, at $10 per thousand board foot change in lumber price equals approximately $12 million of consolidated ebitdda for us on an annual basis. we plan to ship 260 million to 270 million board feet of lumber in the third quarter. we will treat the insurance proceeds associated with the ola, arkansas sawmill as a special item and we will exclude the amounts from consolidated and segment adjusted ebitdda.
shifting to real estate, we expect to sell approximately 2,400 acres of rural land and approximately 50 chenal valley lots in the third quarter. lot demand remains strong and we expect to sell approximately 150 lots for the year. additional real estate details are provided on the slide. we expect our consolidated tax rate will be approximately 15% in the third quarter and 20% for the full-year. overall, we anticipate total adjusted ebitdda will decline sequentially in the third quarter as the effect of lower lumber prices will exceed seasonally higher harvest volumes. we are very bullish on industry fundamentals and we expect lumber prices to remain above long-term averages. we're well positioned with our integrated operating model to continue growing shareholder value over the long-term.
that concludes our prepared remarks. may, i would now like to open up the call to q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of ketan mamtora with bmo capital markers -- markets. your line is open.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you, and congrats on a very strong second quarter, eric and jerry. first question on capital allocation, maybe to start with and i recognizing that you don't want to jump in front of the board on special dividends, can you give us some sense of what is the right way to think about the framework around sort of the level of special dividends, do you think about it in terms of cash flow for the year, should we be thinking about it in terms of leverage, any color there will be helpful?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's probably a really good place to start, ketan, this is jerry, and i'm sure that's topical for a lot of folks including a lot of shareholders. first off, we have this high-class problem where our leverage to lumber prices has really generated a lot of value this year, and fortunately, a lot of that value is going to be shared with shareholders in the form of a special dividend. and we do expect that the amount that will be paid out will be significant, and we've also have described it in presentations this last quarter as multiples of the regular dividend, which is currently $1.64 a share.
and to set the stage, what really drives, again it goes back to the value we're creating through the indexed log arrangement in idaho, as well as the strong lumber prices that are coming through our lumber business. and as a reit, we can only retain so much cash, i mean, we have the benefit usually to retain a fair amount, but the earnings have been so high this year that we have to distribute that to maintain our reit status, which we will never jeopardize that and certainly our destiny is within our control here. so nobody should be worried that we're in danger of breaching those requirements.
in terms of the amount, there is a lot of moving parts, with key one being what is --- what are lumber prices for the rest of the year and there's a lot of complexities given that's reit requirement driven. there is a lot of complexities and a lot of variables we are in the process of looking through and discussing with our board. so unfortunately at this point, i can't give much more guidance or color or sideboards other than it will be significant, it will be in the fourth quarter.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
and, ketan, i'll just add one comment to what, jerry, just said, there's a lot of volatility right now in our earnings stream, particularly in wood products, as you might imagine given the change in lumber prices. and just a month or two ago, we had a wood products forecast for the year earnings that was roughly $200 million for the year higher than where we think we're going to end up now. so think about that $200 million spread across 70 million shares more or less, the amount of volatility in that earnings stream and therefore that dividend is enormous. so we're going to wait until we get to the end of the year to decide what the appropriate special dividend is.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
no, that's absolutely fair and appreciate the color and the context there. now switching to the other side of capital allocation around m&a, can you talk about sort of what is your pipeline looking like and where do you see the most opportunities at the moment, i know it's, you look at sort of both on the timberland side, plus timberlands and sawmills. i'm just curious kind of how the pipeline looks right now?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there is a number of deals that we're currently looking at and we're currently working on. i don't like to get down into the specifics of these deals for competitive reasons. but what i would tell you and what i do think is interesting is that we -- we've been competing for these deals, and on three recent ones, we were actually the high bid and yet the seller changed their minds and decided to not transact, even though we were the high bid in one case, we hit the number that they were looking for and they just changed their minds and walked away from the deal.
so i think timberland m&a is picking up, it's getting interesting, people are seeing timbermart-south data, they're seeing $1,500, $1,600 lumber and they're getting excited. and so the bid-ask spread may still be wide between buyers and sellers, but we continue to kick the tires on deals, and in fact, we did won a mississippi this last quarter, it was 1,100 acres, it was an 11% irr. so it created a lot of shareholder value for us, but we're not going to chase deals and overpay. we're only going to do deals that create shareholder value just like that one that we closed in q2.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. i'll turn it over and jump back in the queue. good luck in the back half of the year.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john babcock of bank of america. your line is open.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, and thank you for taking my questions. i guess just starting out, could you talk about, i know you mentioned a little bit about what you're seeing in the market right now in terms of lumber, just want to get a sense for how demand is right now relative to last week, relative to two weeks ago, particularly at home centers, it sounds like that was where some of the weakness in demand has been, just kind of curious that's picked up, and then also what you're broadly seeing from builders if there has been any change in the trend there, any kind of data you can provide around that or at least commentary would be useful?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so on the home center demand question, yeah, when prices got up to $1,600 or so a month or two ago, essentially, there was a buyer strike. it looks like to us, diy demand just dried up. and probably some of that might have just been due to people spending time on leisure activities in the summer time. it could have been that covid was now in the rearview mirror, people would go out and travel and go to movies and restaurants and whatnot, but there was a real buyer strike that happened a month or two ago.
and so demand just ground to a halt, virtually no takeaway. and we have started to see demand pick up from the home centers. it's not where it was a year ago, but it is increasing. so our view is that nobody wanted to get caught with a lot of $1,600 lumber on the balance sheet. and so they stopped buying, they let -- prices have now drifted lower and now we're seeing demand come back, because the risk is off for the home centers. so we feel like demand is coming back, and now that we're getting into the fall, we're going to start to see r&r activity pick up again is, as people return from summer vacation and whatnot.
what i'd tell you on the housing start side is, i don't know that i've ever been this optimistic regarding the outlook for housing. it is just incredible. if you look at what the homebuilders, the public company homebuilders have been saying with recent earnings releases, whether d. r. horton, lennar, pulte this morning, i could just go on and on about the very favorable things they're talking about in terms of exceptional demand out there. now they're struggling to produce those housing units because of shortages and supply chain issues, but there is just an unbelievable amount of demand. and if you look at what a lot of the pundits are saying, like fea, for example, things that we're going to -- new housing starts are going to keep marching higher up to 1.8 million units per year over the next four years or five years. so just really favorable demand outlook on the housing start side.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just following up on that, particularly as it pertains to the home centers, i mean, it sounds like they were essentially trying to work through some of the higher priced inventory, can you talk about to some actually extent that you have any color on this really, how much might be left for them to work through on that front, also how should we think about when prices might come lower on that side at the home centers, i know that you're not directly in that business and so it might be difficult to predict, but just trying to get a sense for that because that ultimately may come into play in terms of our overall lumber demand?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's really hard for us to know exactly where home center inventory and demand is. but what i'd tell you is that because they went on buyer strike and there still is takeaway at the home centers, their inventories have got to be really lean right now. and like i said, but these prices coming down to $600 or so, they're starting to step back into the market and replenish inventories. so i don't know. that's -- we don't have direct insight into what the home centers doing, just kind of anecdotal.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, no, that's fair. and then just last question before i turn it over, i just want to get a quick sense on northern sawlog pricing and how we should think about how that rolls through results over the next quarter or two, particularly just given the volatility in lumber pricing. so if you could just talk about the lag and kind of some of the color i guess that you provided in the past maybe as well?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that one, john, this is jerry. so in terms of the lag, as a reminder for the group, it's about a four-week lag in terms of lumber price resets. so when i talked in the script about lumber prices for us were down 50% so far in the third quarter compared to the second quarter average. you do have to lag that when you think about indexed sawlog pricing, and again that's about a four-week lag.
the other thing that's in the mix is cedar, which typically sells four times [phonetic], three times [phonetic] and sometimes four times the value of mixed sawlogs. so we certainly have cedar continues to be relatively strong and certainly is not going to come off at the same level. and then the last thing i'll give you is actually in the prepared comments, hey, i had kind of guided that we think third quarter northern sawlog pricing is probably approximately the same as q1 of 2021. so that really should help you all dial in at least what our expectations are.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of paul quinn of rbc capital. your line is open.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
yeah, thanks very much, good morning, guys, and great results.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, paul.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
maybe, sorry, maybe i'll start with the fire at ola, just i know you've got the $2 million deductible, how bad was the fire like, is that a $20 million insurance claim, maybe you could give us some context for it?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so as we said in our opening remarks, i mean, the fire, thankfully, nobody was hurt, thankfully, the whole mill didn't burn to the ground. it was really just one machine center that got damaged. now, unfortunately, it was a very important machine center. the primary large log breakdown line, that's a integral component to running a sawmill. and obviously those machine centers are in very high demand right now from the equipment vendors. so we're trying to find -- we're trying to find a new line. we've identified a really good used one and we've been in discussions with all the vendors about buying a new one. we'll see how the discussions play out, but i'm optimistic that we will wind up getting the used one which is it's been generally used, so to speak, and we will wind up paying a premium.
it's probably, if i had to guess, it's in the $15 million kind of range, now insurance is going to cover that purchase, and there will be demolition and install costs, which again will be covered by insurance. it's hard to know what the full extent of our claim is going to be, because from a business interruption standpoint, it's really dependent upon what happens to lumber prices, but we will be protected, our p&l will be protected as if that ola sawmill was up and running from a business interruption standpoint. so right now, i'd say, it's $15 million for that machinery, it's probably another $5 million to relocate it and install it, and then it's plus business interruption.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
okay. and then just on the equipment providers themselves, yeah, my understanding is that they've got long lead order files two years plus, and so i suspect that wasn't an option, how are you able to source a used one, and is it a working -- is it working right now in a sawmill or is it idle?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, so two different things there. one is on the new equipment side, we can get one as early as middle of next year. so it's not two-year lead times for that particular piece of equipment. so we could get a new one by the, who knows late second quarter or third quarter of next year. the used one, it's about eight years to nine years old. it's at a idle sawmill today, so it's not being run. it's roughly been sitting idle for, i don't know two years to three years. it's very well maintained. that piece of machinery is still sold today by the vendor, which is a leading vendor in the industry.
in fact, if we had to go out and buy a new one today, that's the exact piece of equipment we would buy. now there have been modifications to that thing, since it was originally sold software and whatnot, but we will make all those changes prior to implementing and installing that piece of equipment. so from our view, it's as good as new.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
okay. so, and still like it doesn't sound like there is a huge difference between you bring it up this used one and maybe the end of q1 '22 and a new one in probably q3 of '22. so, and insurance is covering the issue, why would you go used versus new?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, because we think that the used is basically as good as a new. we're going to do diligence on that piece of equipment. we're going to have the original vendor go in and inspect it, and we've been assured by them that this is as good as new. so in our mind, there really is no difference, and we would just soon that mill back up and running as soon as we can. when you have a mill down, your people tend to scatter. and we've talked about this on prior calls, how challenging it is for the industry right now to get skilled labor. we don't want our people to scatter. we want them to stay at that mill. we want them to work. the longer we delay that start-up, the harder it's going to be for us to retain those people.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
okay, that's a very good point. okay. so maybe just turning to lumber, just on, i'd like the monthly breakdown in pricing, what is your july average price to-date?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
july average is, forecast is $720. now remember, our order files -- so, paul, remember our order files, we're always selling stuff out into the future. so some of that $720 captures those high prices that we were still seeing back in june.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
yeah, no, i understand the lag. okay. and then just you highlighted how strong the plywood market is, is that a meaningful pickup, is that like a 5% annual run rate this year or is that more meaningful than that?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, we don't like -- for competitive reasons, we don't like to breakout the results of our plywood business, but just like with lumber, the earnings in that business, it's multiples of what it would be in a normal year.
paul quinn -- rbc capital -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks very much, guys. best of luck.

your next question comes from the line of kurt yinger of d.a. davidson. your line is open.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks, and good morning, eric and jerry.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, just starting off on the harvest outlook, i guess, first, what should we be expecting in terms of normalized idaho harvest levels going forward? and secondly, as we think about 2022 weather and demand permitting, is that roughly 6 million ton harvest level that originally outlined for this year a reasonable starting point?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so, kurt, i'll take that one, this is jerry. in terms of -- i'll start with the back part of your question because i think it's -- it tees up the answer well, which is 6 million ton still is our normal run rate. when you think about our idaho and our southern harvest, 6 million tons give or take is about the sustainable level. we were harvesting roughly the same amount that's growing each year. there is some moving parts this year in the harvest unfortunately, first half, eric had touched on in his comments that on our ola timberlands district, our ola sawmill was a key outlet for and purchaser of a lot of the sawlogs that are produced in that region.
so we think part of the reason why the harvest guidance for the year has come down from the 6 million tons, as we think we're going to be 200,000 tons short in that district for -- because of the ola fire this year. so that harvest volume would be deferred. we -- we continue to grow fortunately and it will be delivered in future years. the other thing that's happening here is in idaho, certainly, we have prioritized delivering sawlogs. so when we have logging contractor availability, we're going to push it to the sawlogs just to make sure that we can deliver into the strong markets and pulpwood becomes less of a priority.
so when you look at kind of the volumes so far this year, pretty anemic on the pulpwood side in idaho, but it's a -- as you recall, that's pretty low margin business to start with, and like i said, we've really shifted the logging capacity. so the other explanation as to why we're short, 5.7 million tons versus a 6 million tons is there's probably 100,000 tons on the pulpwood that -- in idaho. at the end of the day, it's just low margin stuff at the end of the day, so.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, especially when you think about all the sawmill residuals that are being produced or have been produced here over the last few quarters, it's really put downward pressure on pulpwood prices to whereas -- like jerry said, there is low or no margin in producing that stuff.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it, ok, that makes a lot of sense. and i guess just sticking on the log side, it looks like that was a modest headwind versus last quarter. could you remind us how to think about the lag of those fiber costs in idaho, is that something you would expect, i guess more pressure from in q3 as you absorb q2 pricing?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, just to clarify your question, are you thinking in terms of wood products purchase of logs, kurt?
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
correct.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so that lag that i talked about earlier, it's about a four-week lag in terms of a price reset. so we're again, we saw or expect northern sawlog pricing to come down, call it 25%, if you just take the marker, which is q3 probably looks very similar to q1 in terms of the realization. now i'll tell you get some price relief going forward in the st. maries mill complex in terms of the indexed sawlogs, but probably not as fast as you're seeing the -- as you're seeing the lumber price realizations come down.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, got it, all right. so it's the same, i guess as the pricing is going through the timberland segment, that makes sense. okay. and then i was just curious if you could talk about with all this volatility whether you're seeing any change in the approach to inventory or buying from your distributor customers and ultimately how you think that may impact the market going forward? you spoke to the psychology impact there, is that something that you think will just in other factor kind of lending itself to more big swings going forward?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there is a huge psychology impact from lumber purchasers. when prices get to really high levels, people start to get really nervous. they don't want to get stuck with a lot of inventories, you can imagine on their balance sheet, and so they'll stop buying, but they want to meet end customer demand. so they tend to buy lumber, ship directly from mills via truck and not like rail, where it takes a month or something. so the psychology is huge. we got to those high prices, buyers went to really lean inventories and then prices collapsed, especially as diy wasn't showing up at the home centers to buy inventory.
so now the situation is prices have really come down and the home centers have got really lean inventories. we think as we get into the fall and people return from vacations and whatnot, we do think there's going to be a pickup in the diy, in the r&r segments and demand is going to come back and the home centers are going to have to replenish inventories, and we think that's going to provide some support for pricing here in the third and fourth quarters. so psychology is a large, large part of what happens here.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
right, great, ok, great, well, appreciate all the color, and good luck here in the back half, guys.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mark weintraub of seaport research partners. your line is open.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
thank you. so it's kind of interesting as you were referencing the fact that your pulpwood prices and profitability is very low for the reasons you noted down in south, and at the same time, we've been reading about how there has been some increase in pulpwood costs because of weather, etc. and i guess it sort of really brings to the forefront that maybe there are regional differences that go on in the south from -- certainly from time to time. and so just trying to get a sense, i know that you sell a lot of logs and you also buy a lot of logs in the south as a starting point. are you basically selling and buying in the same wood baskets or do you have exposures in some wood baskets where you're selling more and you're buying more in others within the south?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i guess to start with, mark, the -- my reference to weaker pulpwood prices was idaho specific, big picture we're seeing pretty stable sawlog prices and pulpwood prices in our southern wood baskets and that kind of flies in the face of timbermart-south report that came out recently, which on a simple average basis indicated sawlog pricing up 13%, and like some people got excited that maybe the sawlog price recovery is here, our view is it's not.
a couple of things that i will share is one, we think the timbermart-south data, while it's good to have it out there, it's probably based on a thin set of transactions. for example, we don't submit information that's included in that database. and we are second largest timberland owner in the state of arkansas. so there's a big part of the data that's not in there.
and like i said, we see typically a little bit of lift from time to time, as there is a new large mills either brought up in the greenfield fashion or there is an expansion, we see what weather premiums, usually it might be a $1 or $2, and then it seems like every time up to this point, it's going to settle back down into this long-term norm, which for us is probably around this $44 per ton, $45 per ton on a delivered basis sawlog. so i think our view is one got to be cautious with the data. we have a lot of data that we look at in our wood baskets and it's been pretty stable to this point, and any, like i said, premium has been short-lived and things have kind of settled into the long-term average norm.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, that is -- that's helpful. and so just to clarify, and so you think that would sort of not putting on the spot because you don't see all the different regions, but so you -- would that comments be really specific to just where you have a presence or do you think that's a fair description for the u.s. south overall?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i can only speak to our wood baskets, mark, i mean, that's where we have fairly deep data and we just -- we don't have direct exposure to the other southern wood baskets. so my comments are potlatchdeltic experience specific.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
fair, fair. and shifting gears just back to the capital allocation, and thanks for the color on the special being multiples, the regular dividend, that's helpful in sort of framing, you also i think, eric also mentioned or maybe if you jerry, that you also be relooking at the kind of the regular dividend as well. last year you had for the first time in quite a while given a relatively small bump, what would sort of be the -- what would be sort of the determinants, the drivers that would lead you to your conclusions on what's appropriate now? i mean, it seems like you'll have maybe a bit more cash on the balance sheet, but a bunch of it's going to be paid out in the special. so what would sort of be the thought process that would make it -- makes sense to be pushing that up this year or is it sort of just more of this like inflationary type of small increases that one should expect from time to time?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so mark, our dividend -- we -- any changes we make to it, any increases that we make, we need to be convinced, we need to have conviction that is, it is sustainable, first and foremost. i think as you know, our -- our idaho indexed sawlog contracts are unique in the industry and they are creating a tremendous amount of cash at these current sawlog prices, even though they come down or they're coming down, still creating an enormous amount of cash for us.
given that our view was that lumber prices are going to remain relatively high over the next several years, especially given this backdrop that bc needs roughly $600 lumber to get to breakeven. our sense is that cash flows are going to remain relatively strong in our timberland business, especially as it relates to idaho. so i would just say that we're well positioned for our board to consider increasing that base dividend beyond our current $1.64 per share, but that's decided in december of each year.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
okay, that makes a lot of sense. the, i guess on that point on the cash costs in bc being so high, i mean, have -- you mentioned also that there were some curtailments, i think canfor is that one. i mean, are we seeing anything in bc or anywhere else related to this higher cash costs that sort of reinforce that conviction that those higher wood costs there are going to help create a floor or is that still kind of yet to be seen?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, canfor is the only one that come out and publicly state that they're curtailing, but we are hearing lots of rumors, and we have customers that we know are curtailing and cutting back hours. they may not be making a public announcement about it, but it's happening behind the scenes. as it relates to bc, what i would say is that those log decks that those mills have right now are from logs that have been purchased in the prior quarter two [phonetic]. and so there is still relatively low cost logs, but they are facing real headwinds as we get into q3 and q4 when those log prices reset. so i think the clock is ticking is kind of how i would word it.
mark weintraub -- seaport global -- analyst
thank you, eric.

operator
good morning. my name is paula, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the potlatchdeltic third quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions]
thank you. i would now like to turn the call over to mr. jerry richards, vice president, and chief financial officer, for opening remarks. sir, you may proceed.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, paula. good morning, everyone, and welcome to potlatchdeltic's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining me on the call is eric cremers, potlatchdeltic's president, and chief executive officer.
this call will contain forward-looking statements. please review the warning statements in our press release, on the presentation slides, and in our filings with the sec concerning the risks associated with these forward-looking statements. also, please note that a reconciliation of non-gaap measures can be found on our website at www.potlatchdeltic.com.
i'll now turn the call over to eric for some comments and then i will cover our third-quarter results and our outlook.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jerry. our consolidated ebitdda was $107 million in q3 down from our record quarterly ebitdda of $275 million in q2. although we experienced a significant drop in lumber prices, it was still an excellent quarter for the company. to provide context, q3 ebitdda is the highest quarterly amount that we have generated prior to the lumber price run that began in 2020. that statement includes 2018 when our quarterly ebitdda peaked at $102 million. we are encouraged by recent lumber price trends as lumber prices appear to have found the bottom during q3 and are now moving higher.
our wood products segment generated $27 million of ebitdda in the third quarter. importantly, the segment's focus on improving safety performance was evident this quarter, six out of seven mills had zero recordable incidents during q3 and all our mills were incident-free in august and september.
as discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we had a fire at our ola, arkansas sawmill on june 13. nobody was injured and the damage was limited to the large log primary breakdown machine center. insurance will cover the cost of restoring operations at the mill along with lost profits above a $2 million deductible. we decided to purchase new replacement equipment. demolition and construction work is well underway and we are scheduled to receive the new large log line equipment by the end of q2 of next year and we expect to complete the installation in q3. in the meantime, we restarted the small log line this month and we anticipate ramping up to produce approximately 30 million board feet on an annual basis until the large log line restarts. as a reminder, ola had an annual capacity of 115 million board feet prior to the fire.
our plywood business is performing exceptionally well and we continue to expect record profitability from this business this year. as we have discussed on prior calls, our industrial-grade plywood is used in big-ticket boats, rvs, truck trailers, and furniture. demand for these items remains very strong.
our timberland segment earned ebitdda of $76 million in q3, nearly even with the record ebitdda of $77 million last quarter. our average sawlog price of $191 per ton in idaho is the second-highest on record. this highlights the value being created by our indexed sawlog sales contracts which are unique in the industry. our idaho team did a great job managing fire risk this summer, which resulted in our losses being limited to less than $1 million after salvage operations.
in the south, the weather has constrained logging activity this year resulting in our harvest volume being lower than planned. we experienced extreme winter weather in the first -quarter and it has been unusually wet in the second and third quarters. the resulting shortage of sawlogs has the price of southern pine sawlogs to increase. our southern team is working hard to mitigate the harvest shortfall. in addition to the weather-related risk, we continue to expect that our southern sawlog harvest will be approximately 200,000 tons below our annual harvest plan due to the ola sawmill fire.
our real estate segment's ebitdda declined in the third quarter as expected. demand for residential lots in chenal valley remains strong and we continue to see good interest in commercial and rural acreage. we will provide more color on the fourth-quarter earnings call but 2022 is shaping up to be another strong year for real estate.
turning to lumber prices. random lengths has reported higher lumber spot prices eight weeks in a row since the market bottomed in late august. the latest framing lumber composite price of $575 per thousand board feet is $186 or 48% higher than the august 27th composite price. furthermore, lumber prices -- lumber futures have also increased sharply since the summer. the november contract is currently well above $600 per thousand board feet and the last prices for 2022 contracts were well above $700 at yesterday's close.
housing-related fundamentals that drive demand in our business remain robust. seasonally adjusted us housing starts at 1.56 million units in september were 7% higher than september 2020 and are near the 2021 average. it appears that supply chain challenges continue to govern the pace of construction as the us census bureau reported that there were 1.45 million housing units under construction at the end of september. that figure includes single and multifamily units and it is not seasonally adjusted. homebuilder confidence remains very strong with the nahb homebuilder index at 80 this month. low interest rate, shortage of homes, and the large millennial demographic cohort all continue to underpin our view that housing is set up for a multi-year boom.
lumber takeaway in the repair and remodel market returned to healthy levels after labor day and our business is growing in this market segment. long-term fundamentals remain positive, including the age of us housing stock which is now 42 years on average, high levels of home equity, and the fact that remote work continues to be a common practice.
on the supply side, higher costs, a tight labor market, and equipment supplier bottlenecks govern the pace of new lumber capacity. fiber availability across western canada and the western us and the shortage of truck drivers are also constraints. overall, the fundamentals that drive our business remain favorable and we continue to expect that lumber prices will remain structurally higher than long-term historical averages. our leverage to lumber strategy is perfectly situated to continue to drive strong financial performance.
turning to capital allocation. returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority. we expect to pay a special dividend of $3 to $5 per share in december. in addition, our board typically evaluates our regular annual dividend which is currently $1.64 per share per year in the fourth quarter. our strong financial position provides a solid platform as we consider additional investments in our existing mills and accretive acquisitions. we are interested in acquiring timberlands, mills, or a combination of the two near our current operating areas.
turning to environmental, social, and governance reporting, we are focused on quantifying scope 3 greenhouse gases, climate risks, and opportunities across the business and evaluating our greenhouse gas reduction opportunities. we plan to publish our third annual esg report next may and our first climate and carbon report later in 2022. potlatchdeltic is a leader in sustainable forest management and we are committed to environmental and social responsibility and responsible governance.
to wrap up my comments, potlatchdeltic strategy is well aligned with favorable industry fundamentals and our strong liquidity and prudent capital allocation strategy position us to continue increasing shareholder value.
i will now turn it over to jerry to discuss third-quarter results as well as our outlook.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, eric. starting with page 4 of the slides. our adjusted ebitdda decreased from $275 million in the second quarter to $107 million in the third quarter. the sequential decline in ebitdda was largely due to lower lumber prices. information for our timberland segment is displayed on slides 5 through 7. the segment's adjusted ebitdda of $76 million in the third quarter was comparable to the record ebitdda of $77 million generated by timberlands in the second quarter. we harvested 462,000 tons of sawlogs in the north in the third quarter. the idaho harvest volume was seasonally higher than the 354,000 tons harvested in the second quarter.
northern sawlog prices decreased from a record $245 per ton in the second quarter to $191 per ton in the third quarter or 22%. note that $191 per ton is our second highest quarterly sawlog price ever. demand for cedar sawlogs remains robust and the average price we have realized for our cedar sawlogs is approximately 70% higher in 2021 compared to last year.
in the south, we harvested 1,037,000 tons in the third quarter compared to 876,000 tons in the second quarter. logging activity was constrained by wet weather. there was a shortage of trucking and sawlog volume was down due to the fire that occurred at the ola sawmill in june. our southern sawlog prices were 10% higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. the increase includes 5% higher pine sawlog prices, which we believe is due to weather-related log shortages along with a seasonally higher mix of hardwood sawlogs.
turning to wood products on slides 8 and 9. adjusted ebitdda declined from $205 million in the second quarter to $27 million in the third quarter. our average lumber price realizations decreased 55% from $1,185 per thousand board feet in the second quarter to $533 per thousand board feet in the third quarter. to provide context, it's helpful to look at our lumber prices by month. our average lumber price realizations per thousand board feet went from $719 in july to $469 in august and $433 in september.
the timing of shipments to customers caused our lumber prices to lag the spot prices reported by random lengths in the month of september. the lag effect is driven both by the timing of shipments and the length of our order file. we shipped 265 million board feet of lumber in the third quarter. as eric discussed earlier, our ola, arkansas sawmill has not been operating since the fire occurred on june 13, reducing our overall production. our team did a good job managing truck and rail transportation challenges in the quarter.
moving to real estate on slides 10 and 11. the segment's ebitdda was $9 million in the third quarter compared to $12 million in the second quarter. lower rural land sale closings quarter-over-quarter was partially offset by an increase in residential lot sales in our chenal valley master-planned community in little rock, arkansas. our team has increased the pace at which they are developing residential lots this year. strong demand has resulted in our unsold lot inventory dropping significantly. it has been hard to increase lot inventory to more normal seasonal levels as residential lots are effectively selling at the pace they're being developed.
shifting to financial items, which are summarized on slide 12. our total liquidity increased to $972 million. this amount includes $593 million of cash, as well as availability on our undrawn revolver. as eric mentioned, we are planning to pay a special dividend of $3 to $5 per share in the fourth quarter. based on the number of shares currently outstanding, this would use $200 million to $335 million of cash. we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. as a reminder, we have a 10b5-1 plan in place, which reflects our ability and commitment to repurchase our shares at attractive prices.
we plan to refinance $40 million of debt scheduled to mature in december 2021 and have locked the interest rate. annual interest expense will decline approximately $700,000 on this debt beginning in december.
capital expenditures were $17 million in the third quarter. note that this amount includes real estate development expenditures, which are included in cash from operations in our cash flow statement and excludes timberland acquisitions. the third-quarter amount also includes capital expenditures of $5 million to rebuild the ola, arkansas sawmill which are covered by insurance. we expect that our total capital expenditures will be approximately $70 million in 2021 excluding acquisitions and including the ola sawmill rebuild. we have received initial insurance proceeds of $13 million to date.
i'll now provide some high-level outlook comments. the details are presented on slide 13. we expect to harvest 1.3 million to 1.5 million tons in our timberlands segment in the fourth quarter. total estimated harvest of 5.4 million to 5.6 million tons for the year is lower than the 6 million tons planned. the shortfall is due to several factors.
first, it was uneconomic to redirect approximately 200,000 tons of sawlogs that we would have delivered to our ola, arkansas sawmill. second, as eric mentioned, persistent wet weather in the south earlier this year has caused our harvest to fall short of plan. our team is working hard to mitigate the amount of the shortfall. third, we have lowered our pulpwood volume in idaho as it has virtually no margin at current prices. note that our sawlog harvest in idaho will meet our harvest plan on a volume basis but not on a tonnage basis. the ratio of tons to thousand board feet is affected this year by drier than normal sawlogs due to the extreme heat and the size of sawlogs. we expect sawlog prices to be lower in the north and the south in the fourth quarter.
our average lumber price thus far in the fourth quarter, including orders booked but not yet shipped, is approximately $500 per thousand board feet or 6% lower than our average third-quarter lumber price. keep in mind that our average price for july shipments was $719 per thousand board feet which pulled the q3 average up. as a reminder, a $10 per thousand board foot change in lumber price equals approximately $12 million of consolidated ebitdda for us on an annual basis. we plan to ship 240 million to 250 million board feet of lumber in the fourth quarter.
shifting to real estate, we expect to sell approximately 4,500 acres of rural land and approximately 35 chenal valley lots in the fourth quarter. additional real estate details are provided on the slide. we expect our consolidated tax rate will be approximately 15% in the fourth quarter. overall, we anticipate total adjusted ebitdda will decline sequentially in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and a decline in sawlog prices. we're very bullish on industry fundamentals and we continue to expect lumber prices to remain above long-term averages. we are well-positioned with our integrated operating model to continue growing shareholder value over the long term.
that concludes our prepared remarks. paula, now i'd like to open the call to q&a.

just start off on the real estate segment. could you remind us where you stand in terms of remaining lot sales pipeline in chenal valley and kind of the runway you have there in terms of, i guess, estimated lot sales over the next couple of years?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, good morning, kurt. and in terms of remaining lots and i'll step back and provide some overall background. i mean so 4,800-acre master plan community. it was started in 1989 by deltic. originally had overall about 5,100 total residential lots and there is about just under 1,700 that are left. and at the current sales rate, that's probably about 10 years of supply if we kept at the same rate that we're selling at currently.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it, ok. thanks for that. and then on the harvest, sounds like some weather issues and obviously, the ola mill wasn't taken the same tonnage as before. are there any other challenges there in terms of flexing harvest levels up? still a pretty good pricing environment and as you look ahead, any thoughts around how you might be able to ramp that in 2022?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, kurt. and there really -- when you think about the factors that are constraining harvest and causing us to fall a bit short this year i mean really the items i just laid out in the prepared comments. the only other product line i would talk about that i didn't mention was southern pulpwood. and certainly in arkansas, if you go back to 2019 we had a bleached board mill that gp closed and certainly, that's made a well-supplied market even more well-supplied.
so, if you ask our team down there, what is their biggest challenge, it's continuing to move pulpwood. now, we do benefit from supply contracts as well as some fsc certified wood that helps us in that aspect but -- and our team is able to move that volume, but certainly, that's the other thing that we think about. but there's no doubt in our mind, i would expect -- we're in the process of planning now, but i do expect that our plan is 6 million tons next year, that's about our sustainable level and our team absent these weather issues and ola sawmill fire does a pretty good job of easily meeting that plan.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it, ok. that's helpful. thanks, jerry. and then, it looked like there were a couple of discrete items that kind of weighed down wood products in the quarter. and i'm wondering, first, how much lag there is in terms elevated idaho sawlog prices from q2 and q3 kind of flowing through on the cost side? and then outside of fiber, can you just talk a bit about some of the other cost pressures you're seeing on the manufacturing side.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take the first one of those in terms of the lag. it's a dynamic where certainly our mill complex in saint maries, idaho is purchasing logs on an index to lumber basis, which means when you have a run in sawlog pricing in idaho like we did earlier this year, that's going to be sitting in inventories. and it's not uncommon especially when you have a pretty precipitous drop in lumber price to see a charge like we had, it was $6.4 million, which is in the materials. so, it's not unusual to see that. and the lag really depends on the time of the year. i mean, when you think about what we're doing right now is we're building a log pile to take us through spring breakup next year, so log inventories are building to like the high point for the year. they are at their low point coming out of spring breakup on the other end. so, when you think about this particular inventory charge, i would say, inventories were probably more than normal level through the summer just to give some context there. and then i'll turn it to eric for the other question.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, kurt, your question about where are we seeing kind of cost inflation in wood products. what i would tell you undoubtedly across the entire company, costs are moving up meaningfully, just about everywhere we turn. just to give you a few examples in wood products compared to a year ago, our saw blade costs are up 20%, lube oil was up 18%, strapping is up 13%, plywood resin is up 45%, and tires are up 100%. and i can give you examples in our other business units as well.
in total, across the entire company, we estimate costs are running about $10 million to $15 million per year higher than they were a year ago, which is well above kind of normal 3% inflation. and of that $10 million to $15 million, i would tell you, probably $2 million to $3 million of that is in our wood products business.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. yeah, that's super helpful quantification. thanks for that. and then just a last one. even after the special dividend, it looks like the balance sheet will have i think a couple of $100 million of cash. how are you thinking about the ability to deploy that to m&a and how long would you be willing to kind of carry an elevated cash balances in some sizable transactions or to materialize?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, we will have a sizable cash balance at the end of the year even after paying our anticipated special dividend. i guess the way we -- when we think about all the capital allocation levers that we have, we like to increase the dividend. of course, it's going to be increased on a sustainable basis. it's largely going to be driven by our timberland cash flows and, of course, the board is going to look at that when we get out to december for what the dividend should be in the following year.
we still love spending money in our mills, that's where the highest-return projects can be found. we're still vetting our potential projects for next year, but i expect an aggressive capital spending plan for wood products for next year. and then the heart of your question is really m&a. yeah, we are chasing lots of m&a opportunities right now. i would tell you it's primarily on the timberland side. we're pretty far down the path with a couple of conversations. i'm optimistic that we'll get one or more of these to close in the next quarter or two. but i think one thing about m&a is that you never want to rush a process, you want to let the process play its normal course. if you try to rush the process, especially from a buyer's perspective, you'll tend to overpay. and our goal with m&a is to create shareholder value and the only way you do that is if you do it thoughtfully, judiciously, and let it take its time.
so, we're in no hurry to spend that remaining cash that we have on our balance sheet. we'll let it come out of the balance sheet and in the projects on an as-needed or proposed slow and thoughtful manner but we will take our time with it.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
right, great. okay, that all makes sense. well, appreciate the color, and good luck here in q4, guys.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from mark weintraub of seaport research partners.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you. first, jerry, you mentioned some of the price trajectories on lumber, $500 quarter-to-date. if random lengths' pricing were to stay where it is, could you ballpark where the average price for the quarter would be or where the average price today is on your math?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. mark, let me take a stab at that. our q4 lumber prices to date, as we mentioned, they're running about 5% lower than q3. based on shipments and prices that were included in our order files, that stretch in the early to mid-november. as a reminder, our q3 prices included shipments in july for orders that were actually taken in june at much, much higher prices than the full quarterly average. as jerry mentioned, our july lumber shifted $719 per thousand versus september $433. and we also had backed up inventories at the end of q2. if you recall, the transportation challenges and the home centers really pushed back this.
so, a lot of that expense of lumber got shipped early into q3 and that pulled up our q3 average. now as we get into q4, we're down 5% as i mentioned kind of quarter-to-date, but if you look at it from a spot price standpoint, we're currently running about 2% higher than our q3 averages. so, it's really a question of what happens as we move from now to the end of the year. and our thought is we're in a rising price environment right now but on the counter side to that is that you are starting to get into the winter months when the building season slows.
there's a lot of macro factors that are going to support lumber prices going forward, whether it's lumber demand for new home construction or relatively strong r&r markets or supply struggling to keep up with demand here, but our sense is prices are going to be flat to maybe down slightly at the end of the year comparing q4 to q3 and i think that assumption is that random lengths kind of follows that same trajectory of kind of flattish from here to the end of the quarter.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
so, i'll jump in mark with another piece of data that will help you as you think about modeling q4 pricing. that $500 per thousand board feet price quarter-to-date, that includes shipped and order file priced inventory that represents about $100 million feet out of the 240 to 250 that we're estimating we shipped for the quarter.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay, great. that's very clear and helpful. second, i'm curious, we have had no lumber prices started to go back up again and i would think that if i'm a homebuilder or somebody in the inventory chain after what has happened earlier this year and not -- didn't have lumber available, i would want to make sure i'm going to have lumber. are you seeing inventory build in the channel at this point? is that one of the things that might be going on or not?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
no, i don't think there is inventory build going on in the channel, mark. i would, i think you're kind of on to something here. if i was a homebuilder or dealer, i might be thinking about building inventories right now because what's happening is, if you compare year-over-year lumber demand -- expects it to go up 3 billion board feet next year versus this year. but then you look at housing starts data, housing starts are expected to be, almost every major econometric forecasting firm thinks housing starts are going to be flat year-over-year. so you say, huh, starts are going to be flat year-over-year but lumber demand is going to be up 3 billion board feet year-over-year. what's driving that demand increase?
well, it's not r&r. what's really happening is the order backlogs of the builders is going through the roof and those homes have got to be built and they've got to be built with lumber and that's what's driving that extra 3 billion board feet. and if you -- interestingly, if you look at the supply side of the equation, what we're starting to hear is that production -- lumber production in '21 is turning out to be very comparable to lumber production in 2020. and you would say, how could that possibly be? think of all the new mills that have been built and think of early 2020 when covid first hit and 40% of north american mills went on curtailment, how can lumber production be flat year-over-year? and it's because there's a whole host of supply chain, labor, and trucking issues that are impacting the industry and making it challenging to boost lumber production. so demand going up with supply relatively flat, i think the backdrop here is for a pretty strong pricing environment next year.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then just two other quick ones. one, you mentioned costs of $10 million to $15 million. you mentioned that was more than the typical 3%. what does $10 million to $15 million on a percent basis order magnitude translated to?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
might be 5%, 6%.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay, great. and then lastly on the regular way dividend, the ongoing dividend you talked about, timber profitability is a critical driver to how you think about that. at the same time, i think you argued a compelling case on why lumber has done so well and is well-positioned. how much -- what does that potentially feed into your willingness to set the dividend at -- potentially at a higher level if you think that there's legs to it or is that something that is more likely to translate into either one-time returns of capital to shareholders?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think it definitely weighs into our thinking. it may not be a mathematical exercise but it points to industry conditions. if we have strong results from our wood products business, we're likely to have strong results from our timberlands business as well. so, i think it just hits -- reinforces kind of what our view might be about how positive we are in terms of our outlook.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
and have you contemplated having a more mathematical approach that you share with investors as some of your peers do now in terms of the distribution?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's a question we've gotten at times over the years, mark. and we're really not looking at it as a pure mathematical exercise. certainly, a large competitor has moved toward a low base dividend with a variable component. and as it turns out this year, we have a special dividend. i wouldn't -- certainly wouldn't advertise that as we're moving to a similar model, it's really more a statement than -- it's the right thing to do to make sure that we stay well within our reit test rules, as well as it's the right thing to do from a capital allocation standpoint to get that cash back. but we look at it and as eric -- and we were reinforced over the years, eric said this morning, is really we look at the regular way dividend as it needs to be sustainable and we want to grow it over time. and it's really pinned to the stable part of our cash flow stream. and then certainly the volatile -- more volatile cash streams has been where we've been opportunistic in buying shares, special dividend this year, investing in mills, m&a those types of things.
so, we're not sure that it makes sense to put a marker out there. coincidentally, run the math and we do look at our payout ratio all the time. if you took the range of the special dividend and looked at it near term within the last 12 months as well as over a longer period of time, we are distributing about 75% of our cash to shareholders. that's not because that's the math and that's the target, but that's kind of where we're at, which is really not off the mark with others who do publish a benchmark.
mark weintraub -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you, appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from ketan mamtora of bmo capital markets.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. just want to come to southern timber prices and i recognize that prices kind of don't move around too much quarter-to-quarter. but i am just curious if you're seeing kind of any real signs of kind of uptick in southern timber prices. i mean q3 obviously was up quite nicely, but are you seeing sort of structurally kind of better demand, supply, and prices going higher?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that certainly has been an ongoing part of the conversation in terms of when is southern sawlog price is going to tip up given they've been relatively flat since the great financial crisis. but you know, as we -- as i covered in the prepared comments, we did see pine sawlog prices actually were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter and certainly the other reason sawlog prices were up in the south where a seasonally higher mix of hardwood. but our view to this point has been it's really log shortages caused by the extraordinarily wet weather. to this point, we do see a bit of life for or a bit of increase in sawlog pricing, pine sawlog pricing in the south when there are shortages when there is a major new capacity addition in a wood basket. but so far that's been fairly fleeting.
when we look at the data, i mean there's still certainly is an excess of standing timber relative to what's being harvested each year in our wood baskets. so, i think it's too early in our view to call that a structural shift. although there is a lot of positive signs there and we certainly have our eye on that as well, ketan. so, time -- i think we need more time under our belt before we will start calling victory in terms of a structural increase in sawlog pricing.
now having said that, we think we're closer to getting to a balance in the south than we have been. and in our comments here over the last summer's we've been meeting with shareholders, certainly been constructive in that way. so, 2025 is out there a little bit farther, but we think we certainly are getting closer to that day when we finally do see a structural shift if it's not starting at this point.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
understood, that's helpful. with that kind of backdrop, do you think sort of growing the timber side of the business, especially in the us south kind of becomes more attractive as you look out next two, three, five years, given kind of timber getting into sort of better supply/demand balance?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. ketan, absolutely. we think the place to go to grow our business from an m&a standpoint is clearly the us south. markets are very deep in the south, they are very liquid, there is a lot of transaction activity and we do have a favorable outlook longer-term. near term, as jerry said, the next couple of years, we still think we're in a flattish kind of price environment. but you get out there, year four, year five, we do think eventually prices are going to turn, but don't forget sellers expect that to happen as well. so, it tends to get priced into the deal.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
i guess the other thing i'll jump in, ketan, and add to that is, we're also seeing obviously with dialog around carbon credits, we'll see how that plays out. but more currently, we're looking at opportunities in solar and wind and kind of other alternative cash flow streams that we've not seen related to timberlands. and certainly, that's part of what gives us some confidence as we underwrite deals as well.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it, that's very helpful. i will turn it over. good luck.
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

your next question comes from john babcock of bank of america.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning/afternoon. i guess just the first question, the dividend range for the special dividend rather seems to be relatively wide. i was just wondering what's going to drive that to the high and the low end?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well. yeah, john, i think it really depends upon -- the board is going to meet in early december and it's going to look at how are we doing in q4 and it's going to look at what's our outlook for next year. that's really what's going to drive whether it's at the low-end or at the high-end. and you can recall, we saw lumber prices just completely collapse going from q2 to q3. we expected that to happen at some point during the year, we just didn't know when it was going to happen. but when the board last met, there was a lot of uncertainty as to what the outlook was going to be, so we came up with this range at the end -- excuse me, at the last board meeting and that's what we agreed to convey to investors and analysts.
we have better visibility into how the quarter is going to play out now and we also have better visibility into next year, but this won't get formalized until we meet with the board in early december.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and how much do you still have under the 10b5-1 for share repurchase?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, we really haven't disclosed the parameters of the 10b5-1. but in terms of share repurchase authorization, we have just under $60 million available.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
and as far as the ola sawmill with the new equipment, are you going to get any sort of capacity -- additional capacity associated with that? what sort of efficiencies might we be able to expect. and then also if you can just generally talk about like how you're thinking about your ability to kind of grow capacity going forward? i know in the past, you've talked about some of the high-return projects that you guys have, but any more color you could provide on that would be useful?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the ola sawmill rebuild is going to be really good when it's done. we expect cash processing costs to come down about 10% per thousand at the mill. we expect 15 fewer employees because we're going to be purchasing equipment that is more productive, more streamlined than what we had previously. and sawlog recovery is going to improve about 10% compared to the pre-fire ola, if you will.
capacity from a growth standpoint is going to be about 160 million board feet with net down the, i don't know, 150 million board feet more or less. so, the ola sawmill prior to the fire had a stated capacity of 150 million board feet. we had been challenged to get to that 150 level. you may recall, we were kind of running around the 130 level for the past couple of years since the merger. we were slowly chipping away, getting volume up at the mill. we put it in a new de-braker, put in a new stacker etc., etc. and so, we are working on getting volumes up, but we are still kind of stuck around the 130, 135 level.
well, with the rebuild, we expect to be right up at the 150 level and that's going to push up against our kiln constraints as well as our environmental permit. so, that's a really good place to be. so longer-term going forward, i expect that we'll continue to invest in our mills to grow production. we've got a really good track record of growing volumes anywhere from at the low end 1% per year to the high-end maybe 4% per year. and i would imagine going forward that's going to be -- continue to be the run rate for volume increases out of our mills
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got you. and maybe this is kind of too early to say. i think you mentioned rather the costs, i guess, are up $10 million to $15 million this year. how are you kind of thinking about inflation over the next year or so? and are you seeing anything on the labor front in terms of inflation?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're not. i'm seeing inflation on the labor front in terms of what's going on around the country. it's challenging to get people to come to work. when we have a job opening, we put out an ad. and historically, we might get 30 people applied. now we're getting three people to apply and they may not be that qualified.
i'm reading about potential strikes at large companies around the country. i'm reading about how walmart and mcdonald's and all these other companies are raising wages significantly to attract labor. we haven't formalized our plans next year, but i am very concerned about what's happening on the labor front. in addition to all these other items that we purchased to run our business. just as an example, fertilizer. fertilizer cost is up 30% year-over-year. it's going to make it really challenging for us to justify fertilizing our young timber to improve growth when costs are up 30%. so, it's kind of happening all across the business. all three business units are experiencing it and i would expect it's going to find its way into wage inflation as well.
john babcock -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question comes from paul quinn of rbc capital markets.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks very much. good morning, guys. just a question on the ola sawmill rebuild. of the $70 million capex budget, how much is ola?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
so, of the $70 million, roughly an extra $10 million is going to ola. of that $10 million, paul, we expect insurance to reimburse you know $7 million, $8 million perhaps.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so, insurance to date is $13 million, plus this $7 million, $8 million. so, insurance will be $21 million basically?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so i wouldn't add those paul. so, the insurance claim process will take probably the better part of the next 12 months to sort through when you think about business interruption and everything. so far we have received $13 million of cash as reimbursement from the insurers. that's a combination of bi and equipment. it's not been allocated if you will to those two buckets. and then separately, of the $70 million that -- you've asked about $10 million ola and $7 million to $8 million of that is already been covered by the $13 million we received.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just on your criteria around increasing your sustainable dividend from the current $1.64 level. is the board looking at just timberland or i mean, it seems like your real estate business is pretty stable as well? are they considering real estate contribution as well?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think i mean, the board looks at the entire roll-up for the company which does include real estate cash flows. but at the end of the day, what matters most is timberlands and then i would say, secondarily, it's wood products and then real estate.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, i mean, i probably asked this in the last decade but just -- that stumpage amount seems very -- the $1 per ton seems very whippy. and just wondering why it's so low compared to just about every benchmark that's there on stumpage. i mean it is $21 in q3, it was $6 in q2, just wondering why it's lower?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, that's a number that will move around significantly, paul. in this time, one, as you know, stumpage doesn't include logging and hauling. so, there's in the south, that's another, call it, $22, $23 a ton. but also it depends on the mix of what's available and it's heavy to pulpwood which has much lower margin sales than certainly sawlog stumpage would be.
paul quinn -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's all i had. best of luck.
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
great, thanks.
operator
your next question comes from buck horne of raymond james.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, thanks for the time. going back to the cost inflation question and what you're seeing across the industry and the economy at large here in the logistics challenges and hurdles out there. i'm just kind of curious, your thoughts on, do you think this is going to further curtail marginal lumber production capacity, whether that's either british columbia capacity or how do you think it might play out in idaho as well. do you think it might shake out some marginal producers faster or how do you think about the supply outlook given the cost inflation the industry is dealing with?
jerald w. richards -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's a really good question or observation, buck. i do think that these inflationary items, these supply chain issues, these trucking issues, labor issues, it's all going to mean it's harder and harder to build a new greenfield mill in north america. and as i reflect back on what's happened here, a couple of m&a transactions. you may have noticed that west fraser bought the angelina mill. they paid $1,000 bucks per thousand board feet of capacity.
well, construction of new greenfield mills are roughly $600 to $700 per thousand yet here, west fraser was willing to spend $1,000 per thousand. i think it's because you're looking at it saying it's really hard to build a new mill these days. the other observation i'd have is, look at gp, they sold four mills to interfor. and i recall the transaction price was up over $500 per thousand of capacity.
well, i can -- i don't know, but i would bet the gp wasn't selling its best mills when it sold those four mills to interfor. and interfor probably looked at and said, do we want to build a greenfield route with this capital that we have, or do we want to go buy these other four mills that gp is selling and they opted to buy the four mills. and i think it's because people are starting to recognize just how hard it really truly is to build new greenfield capacity in this country and i'm sure, in north america.
so in terms of, is it going to shake competitors out of the market? i don't know that i see that. what i see are structurally higher prices because supply is going to struggle to keep up with the demand. and so, i think that means even if you got a fourth quartile mill and a strong pricing environment, you're probably going to be competitive.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
great, that's a great color. i appreciate those thoughts. thank you. and also just curious, you guys are engaged in the m&a market. now it seems like you're pretty far down the line on some discussions. there seem to be a lot more capital that's kind of being introduced into the timber market. just kind of curious, maybe pricing-wise, kind of what you're seeing in terms of per acre values in your regions recently and kind of what new capital is offering out there? and just how competitive is it getting?
eric j. cremers -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's -- timberland has always been a really competitive asset class. it seems like every deal has got a pretty full price in it. i would tell you is that the world is starved for yield right now. central banks around the world have kept rates down to where their real rates are negative in many places, including the us right now if you think about where the 10-year treasury is at relative to where inflation is running. so, where do investors go to get yield? will they tend to turn to real assets? and timber is a great real asset for lash down in the discount rate. i don't know exactly where we're at right this moment, but i'd guess probably 20 to 30 basis points lower than where we might have been a year ago. so call it, say in the high fours from a real discount rate standpoint.
buck horne -- raymond james -- analyst
