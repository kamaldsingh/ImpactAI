[operator instructions] your first question comes from tycho peterson from jpmorgan. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks. appreciate you guys quantifying the corona impact. i guess a couple of things, i mean you'd previously talked about mid single-digit china expectations for the full year. so should we assume that's still the case just more back-end loaded and then mike, as we think about collateral damage within china, how should we think about the c&e market just given that the broader economic activity in china is slowing. so should we think about some impact on c&e as well?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, tycho. i think i'll handle both questions and bob, correct me if i go off script here, but i think we still think that the mid single-digit number is doable for the year in china. what we're seeing already on ground from our team -- we're just on the phone today with our team in china, you know, we're still able to transact and orders are actually coming in as forecast. i think that -- we think a lot of the procurement is going to occur a little bit later in the year. i think a lot of its recoverable with the exception of probably some aspects of our service business where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on their sites. i think we feel pretty good about how we're thinking about china throughout the rest of the year albeit being a very fluid situation and we really haven't seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on c&e. in fact. c&e actually did better than we were thinking in the first quarter. it's too early to call a trend, but some of the pmi's are actually inching up, which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial noise with some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement, but we still remain cautious in terms of the outlook for c&e, but we're encouraged by the q1 results and again, we're not really seeing significant movements around in that area on a global basis and we think back to the first comment on china, we weren't expecting a lot in c&e this year in china anyway, so i think we're in pretty solid shape relative to the outlook there as well.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
and then a follow-up on biopharma. you grew 3% on a 10% comp. last quarter, it was 7% on a 14% comp. so, was that a pull forward last quarter and if so, can you maybe just talk to that dynamic?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think the big story there is china, right?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, that's exactly right, mike. there's two elements there. one is the shifting of the lunar new year from q1 into q2 as well as the impact -- q2 into q1, excuse me, as well as the extension of the lunar new year holiday. so those are the two primary pieces.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and then within the pharma numbers, tyco, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again this quarter as well and then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then we'll see the growth in the small molecule side of that space and then we have really strong growth in nasd and the acg business, strong in pharma. so we're feeling pretty good about pharma.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, tycho.

your next question comes from doug schenkel from cowen. your line is open.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug.
ryan blicker -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, this is ryan on for doug. thanks for taking my question.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
how are you, ryan?
ryan blicker -- cowen and company -- analyst
maybe just to round out the china dynamic quickly, can you provide some more color on your supply chain exposure. within china, it sounds like the operating environment is improving, but how should we think about your direct and indirect supply chain exposure and do you see any risk to your ability to fulfill demand within and outside of china over the course of this year?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure ryan. thanks for that question. so as i touched briefly on my call script, we actually have resumed production and are in a really solid position right now to not only ship product to our customers in china, but also products that are manufactured in china to have them exported into the global market environment and as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, we think for the near-term, we're in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from a shipment perspective and then you also maybe recall that starting with the initiation of the u.s. based tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of china. so it actually has mitigated our risk here as well.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. ryan, this is bob, just to follow-up. we have twice-weekly calls with our team in china inclusive of logistics as well as our supply chain and obviously, it's quite dynamic but as it currently stands today, we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure not only raw materials but also produce the finished goods and ship them not only within china, but also get product into china and vice versa.
ryan blicker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. then maybe just following up with a brief two-parter. number one on the food market, it sounds like things were improving a bit prior to this coronavirus dynamic. can you talk a little bit more about what you were seeing in the market and if you think that the china portion of that market specifically could be poised to return to growth as we get past this kind of coronavirus dynamic and then specifically for gross margin, can you talk about what the timing headwind was for the quarter versus the other dynamics that you called out? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you want to take this bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, yeah, so on food, as i mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress. we have had several quarters of kind of very predictable performance there and actually q1, despite the coronavirus. it probably had more impact on the pharma side than in food, grew 1% on a global basis, it was down slightly in china, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. so we feel good about that. it's probably too early to call that it's going to return to growth. long-term, we do believe it will return to growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year. in terms of the timing of the coronavirus, that $10 million, that was quite a large incremental because we had all the costs. so that was probably a higher than normal kind of incremental drop to the bottom line. that was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter.
ryan blicker -- cowen and company -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.

your next question comes from jack meehan from barclays. your line is open.
jack meehan -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. was hoping [speech overlap] maybe you could give us -- hey. could you give us an update on the nasd roll out at the new site and how much that contributed to the quarter in both dgg and the pharma end market.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so as i'd imagine, you may get a little tired of hearing this from bob and myself, i'm going to pull sam into this conversation, but as we highlighted in the call script, the nasd business continues to ramp as we'd expect. really pleased with the progress and how we're starting to fill out the factory. still not yet at full capacity -- operating at full capacity yet, but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter no doubt and sam, anything else you'd like to add there?
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
no, mike, you hit the nail on the head. it is -- the business is performing as we've expected. we continue to see interest in all the customers -- the pharma customers that we've given tours to, we're doing work now there for a number of customers. not to be boring, nothing new to report. it is progressing per plan.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
it's all good news right now.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would just add, jack. as we had talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in the second half of the year. it's progressing as we expected. it had a slight impact to the dgg and a slight impact to the overall agilent organic core growth and we're very pleased with the progress.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and bob, i think there's maybe just one more point too. while we look at the second half outlook for the business, it is not all about china recovery, the other elements of the business including nasd which we know we're going to have a strong second half.
jack meehan -- barclays -- analyst
great. one follow-up on dgg. the core growth of 7% not to nitpick it too much, but was there anything that was a little softer in the quarter in that segment, just knowing some of the other growth drivers relative to how the segment was growing last year.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think it was really -- this is mike, jack and then, sam, feel free to jump in on this. we had 12% growth last year. so a tough compare. so we had solid growth across all elements of that business and outside of again maybe a china impact for an element of the business, i mean things are firing on all cylinders across the businesses, how i recall.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yes, that's right, mike, i mean we continue to have good growth with market, above market with our overall ngs portfolio. so feel good about that in the low double-digits. our pathology business as you heard in mike's opening comments and bob's as well, we believe we'll continue to gain share there growing in the mid single-digit and you just heard about nasd. so you look at the major parts of dgg, we had i think a really well balanced good quarter.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
because mainly it is the compare [indecipherable].
jack meehan -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no problem.
operator
your next question comes from dan leonard from wells fargo. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so just a couple of things to circle back to. one, what decelerated in the americas in the quarter. your growth rate in that region had been trending higher than 5% for quite some time.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, hey dan, welcome back and appreciate the question. it's really a combination of a very tough compare. i would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. they had a very -- the most difficult compare in the first quarter and we would expect that to improve in q2 through q4 as we get to easier compares.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, and i know jacob, you were looking into this. so --
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, and i think the continued depressed pmi certainly impacts the c&e business, chemical and energy business. so we continue to see that in u.s. being -- performing at least flat and we would like to see improvement but i think it's still -- going to still take some time before that's happening.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and i would add it ended where we expected it to be.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
sure and then a related question, bob, you mentioned when discussing the gross margin dynamics that there were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. could you elaborate on that. are you pulling maybe the pricing lever to drive more demand in the instrument business after four quarters in a row of soft demand in lsag?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, dan. i just can't help but to jump in on this one and i think that question needs to be posed to our competitors because we saw particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, but particularly in the litho chromatography and mass spectrometry platforms and i don't know if you were adding to that, jacob.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president, life sciences and applied markets group
no, i think it's fair to say that we continue to be premium priced, but there is certainly some competition in the market space right now and yeah, so there is a price pressure.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
but we don't play the price game here. i mean that's not how we want to win.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, i appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from patrick donnelly from citi. your line is open.
jesse -- citi -- analyst
hi basis is jesse [phonetic] on for patrick. just wanted to touch on the china impact and i think you guys had laid out about 1% impact to core growth from that. i just wanted to understand how that kind of compared to your expectations that if coronavirus made that a lot worse than anticipated?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, maybe just to be crystal clear here. we saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in q1. we had product that was getting ready. it was staged and getting ready to ship and on the last couple of days of january and with the extension of the lunar new, you know, the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. so we know that was clearly an impact in q1. in terms of q2, what we're expecting between the first half of our year, it's roughly a 1.5 week to three week impact as we're ramping up and most of that's happening in q2. we're expecting in q2 that the coronavirus has roughly a 1 point to 3 point impact to our growth in q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. in the first half, it's $25 million to $50 million and we'll expect to get that back in the second half of our fiscal year.
jesse -- citi -- analyst
okay, that's helpful and then just maybe one on biotek acquisition, just wondering how that business performed relative to expectations and just kind of how the customer reception has been so far as you've kind of broadened the portfolio offering there.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jess, they happen to hit that right open and relative to expectations, it's ahead of our expectations. it really has been just a tremendous addition to the company and we were talking about this the other day inside the company typically when you put together a deal scenario, it's often out of the gate, you don't see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time and that is actually what we saw in the case of biotek in the first full quarter as part of agilent, and jacob, i know you've been talking with customers and how you're thinking about biotek being part of agilen?
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, again i just want to underscore once again that we've been very pleased with the performance of biotek while being here in agilent, but not only biotek, but the whole cell analysis business is doing very well and we are posting double-digit growth for the whole business. so we are very pleased with that and we actually believe this is going to continue for quite a number, quite a long time. we see live cell analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding immune system and immuno-oncology and with now the seahorse, acea and biotek and lock sell combined, we have a very unique value proposition and that is really what excites us and what also is very exciting for customers is that when we combine those technologies or these techniques together, we can create more insights for the researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. so this is very exciting and we're just getting started.

your next question comes from puneet souda from svb leerink. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks, mike. so first question on europe, you pointed 2% growth there. i was hoping to get a view from you on outlook and what you're baking in the guidance here. thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob, why don't i just talk about our performance and you can maybe comment on the outlook. so came in right as expected. i think you know that europe's in a difficult economic environment and we think our team is really doing well there relative to what's going on in the market environment. so we were actually quite pleased with how q1 came out for us in europe and bob, in terms of the outlook?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. yes, so, puneet, good afternoon. as mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2% and that's kind of what we're forecasting in q2 and the rest of the year and certainly the team is doing a really great job being able to deliver in a tough environment, but it kind of hit where we expected and that's kind of what we're expecting for the rest of the year as well.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. so if i could touch back on china. i know it's been covered quite a bit, but if i -- really appreciate your thoughts there given one of the strongest legacy positions in that country for agilent. as the recovery happens here, are there certain segments which you think where you will see more acceleration, more faster recovery, certain product lines or certain segments where you see a recovery faster versus others and then i was sort of also surprised with growth you were seeing in acg, just crosslab continues to deliver. was trying to understand what sort of exposure you had there in china and given the travel restrictions and everything, are you still able to ship products and service instruments seeing the growth in crosslab here or was that -- how much was the impact in crosslab, if you can quantify it. thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, puneet, let me take -- there was a lot into that question, so let me try to hit them. in terms of recovery, we would expect that obviously the instrumentation portion would recover within that probably pharma first and so we would expect that be prioritized over some of the other markets. in terms of acg, we continue to be pleased by the broad based strength there actually even in china despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. we do expect probably a slower ramp up there, less on the consumable side, as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side, as you can imagine, having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult and there is a portion of that would be on demand for servicing equipment and so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower in q2, but then ramp back up to normal latter half of q2 and into q3 and q4, at least that's our current assumption. as mike mentioned, we've been in close contact with our teams in china and i've been watching the order flow and the order flow to date is across both acg and lsag as well as our dgg business, which is a smaller piece tracking to our expectations.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay and any sense in terms of the exposure that you have in china and could that mix change given the -- in the next quarter or so?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no i don't anticipate a major shift. we've largely got a instrument heavy business in china relative to the rest of the business anyway, but our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. so i don't see a dramatic change in q2 or in the back half of the year.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
great, thank you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
welcome, puneet.

your next question comes from dan arias from stifel. your line is open.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
good afternoon guys. thanks, mike, just back to biopharma question.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, dan.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
hey, mike. next quarter, i think the comp goes way down to low singles for that customer segment. so where are you feeling like biopharma growth heads in 2q as we just think about the momentum and the favorable comparison but also china. can that be more mid-singles when we net out the moving parts there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, dan, i think that's a reasonable expectation. so when i was asked earlier about comment on pharma, we would remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma, you know, part of it's going to be the pickup and continued growth that we're going to have in our nasd business. we also know that we're getting to some of the easier compares relative to the lsag instrument business because as you all recall, that's -- in the q2 is when we started seeing the slowdown as china went through this whole looking at their procurement practices around the generic. so we think there's a lot of good reason to be positive about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in q1 in our pharma business.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
and we're expecting a faster growth in q2.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
okay and then maybe one again for you, mike, or maybe even sam, it feels like 1q is always a good time to ask this question just given that some of us are heading down to agbt. any update you can give us on laser gen product development, how much of a focus is that at this point and then maybe what are you looking at in terms of the change in total investment there if we compare 2020 to 2019?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so, i think sam you were getting your bags packed, maybe your team is getting your bags packed to head that -- you are staying at home, that's right, ok. maybe a few comments on this.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
you know overall, thanks for the question, dan, if you would have heard my comments already from jp morgan, we're making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we're doing on the lasers and sequencer particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality and so forth. so we're continuing to make that progress. when you think about agbt, of course, it's not just about sequencers, it's about the overall ngs workflow, it's about really looking at beyond ngs, overall genomics. so we are excited about magnus which we introduced not too long ago. we are seeing -- sorry to remind you, magnus is this really walk away automation for taking dna libraries or actually putting dna in being able to come back and just load that directly onto your ngs sequencer. we've seen some really good interest in that in europe, in america and in china. so we're going to continue sharing the message there and sharing some data from a number of customers. we also, as you would have heard us talk about, we have launched a new sureselect xt hs2 dna reagent kit, which allows us to look at even lower starting amounts down to 10 nanograms of dna for ffte which is very important for cancer. it also allows on illumina sequencers, you know, it's very important to be able to use molecular barcodes. so we have that going on as well and we have a number of partnerships that we're working on with with a number of customers and collaborators, so stay tuned. i think it's going to be an exciting agbt.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and dan, the other part of your question was, [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so our -- just quickly, our spending forecast in 2020 is the same as 2019. so we're not expecting any ramp up.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from derik de bruin from bank of america. your line is open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hey good morning, good afternoon. i have a number of -- got a number of questions. so the first one is, i guess just on the gross margin outlook for 2020. can you sort of walk it through the next couple of quarters in terms of how that looks?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, we talked about at the beginning of the year our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross margin across the company and that hasn't changed. so we've always said that the first half of the year with q1 being the hardest comparison because of the start-up costs in nasd and you can see that kind of in our numbers. we also were affected a little bit as we mentioned before in lsag. we would expect that to recover as we get through the course of the year. so and at a high level, derek, i would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat year-over-year and we're getting our operating leverage is really in the opex expense line.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and, bob, i think we're also looking to see maybe a more favorable mix in our instrument business as we move forward and i made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar year-end kind of phenomena with pricing more stabilizing as we started 2020.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
well, great, that segues into my next question on instruments and so i think you had said last quarter you're expecting maybe flattish instruments for the full year, is that still sort of your expectation. and then that leads into a -- any idea of sort of what pent-up demand could be, i mean do you sense from customers particularly in c&e, there's people waiting on the sidelines to buy when the budget gets better. i'm just trying to get a sense of sort of what the instrument dynamic looks like.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hey, derek, this is bob. i think, short answer on your first question is, yes. we're still in that range of roughly flat. actually, if you looked at q1, we were down 2% core, but if you adjusted for the coronavirus it would have bent down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had. to your point around c&e, had there have been shoots of life you know and some of our customers looking at things now, what i would say is the coronavirus kind of throws some of that into question, but i would say that's still intact right now. i don't know, jacob, if you have anything?
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president, life sciences and applied markets group
however, i do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here and eventually there will be a tech refresh and we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really refreshed across the whole portfolio. so when that pent up demand is coming forward, we are we ready, but we just can't call it right now exactly when that's going to happen.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jacob, i'd just add one thing. early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slow down in c&e. the difference here is that at that time, a lot of our platforms have rather aged. this time, we have a completely refreshed platform. so it also is a great productivity message there to customers and our lab managers obviously have the ability to go to their management and say listen, there is something new out there. i'm not buying this -- i'm not replacing like-for-like.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and then just one maybe i missed something, but you did 3.7% contribution from m&a in the first quarter, 3.5% to 3.7% in the second quarter and then the guide for the full year is 2.8% to 2.9%. is it something else in the first half of the year besides biotek and if not are you expecting -- why you're expecting a step down?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so you've got very good math and we're not expecting a step down. that is the only thing that's in the numbers and that could be an area of potential opportunity.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from brandon couillard from jefferies. your line is open.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
mike, just on a separate topic, could you just sort of speak to the twist settlement last week, why only $25 million and should we expect any legal savings from having a case out of the way now that you'll reinvest those dollars?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so first of all, just, just a few comments on the settlement. so we're very pleased with the agreement that was reached with twist. as you know, we think it's in the best sense of our shareholders to vigorously protect our ip and not only -- in addition to receiving the payment from twist, you also had to procure a license for us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology and we are -- our company is committed to innovation in a right way. so really pleased with how that sentiment goes and bob relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of year, i think we had that in pro forma, right.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. we will pro forma that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so you see'll both the settlement come in brandon as well as the cost associated with that i guess in our q2 results.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
that's correct.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks and then maybe one more higher level question for you, mike. i mean you mentioned sustainability that recognition, clearly that's becoming a much bigger focus i think for the investment community. can you just help us contextualize how that focus may help contribute to your growth or cash flow or differentiate you in terms of the customer base?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. so as i mentioned in my call script, you know, we've been doing these things because we thought it was the right thing to do and now people are really paying attention to it. so i think it helps on multiple aspects of the business. so first of all, relative to our new products, which have a very favorable environmental impact, there is real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own sustainability initiatives and they're very interested -- i'm going -- i have several european customers i'm visiting next month and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. so when you talk to them about how we're reducing the footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don't even use gases and that we've eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography or in the case the npis. so there is just a really -- and we are reducing the size of the packaging and by the way that also comes with the benefit to agilent's p&l. so it really helps in terms of our customer relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts and also it is really quite helpful for recruiting of new employees into the company. new employees when they are looking at potentially joining the company really want to know what agilent stands for and we talk some about our culture and what we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and inclusion. i think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to agilent, but also for those who are part of the agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for, be energized about where the company is going forward. i think we've talked before, i'm a big fan of sports and if you build a great team, you get great things happen in the marketplace or on the field and i think that really is really one of the major benefits you get here, which is what it does for your team. so it really is a multitude of impact for the customers. i mean for the company and something we really believe in.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, thank you.

your next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for squeezing me in. one maybe on china, mike. we've heard some chirps [phonetic] possibly the government doing -- initiating some sort of stimulus here to kick-start the economy. if that were to be the case, where would that impact fall. is that in c&e and food? is that where we would see your china numbers coming up?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
well, i have to say i have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but i haven't seen anything around the specifics of what a stimulus would be, i don't know bob or whether you [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
exactly, i think that's a likely area, that and pharma.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and also, i would also expect environmental as well. so that would be my guess, because these are major quality of life initiatives that the chinese government has been behind. so my guess is that's where they would put the stimulus, but again, we don't have any specifics. that would just be pure speculation on my part at this point in time.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood and bob, quick one on the eps guidance here. i see that the tax rate ticked down sequentially on the guidance front, did anything change on the margins at all, because it looks like the revenue range remains unchanged. so i'm wondering if this is below the line -- or margins some sort of impact here?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer

your next question comes from steve beuchaw from wolfe research. your line is open.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi and thanks for the time everybody.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, steve. i guess first i wanted to start with bob with just a question about one of the underpinnings of the outlook for the year, that hasn't been touched on so much just yet and it's nasd. maybe a two-parter on nasd. one is, did you think we feel good about getting to a few dozen millions of dollars of contribution from nasd and then can you give us any perspective and i guess maybe this is a sam question, as to how much of the capacity on the new facility in fredrick is now contracted and then i have one for mike.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
let me make sure i answer your question correctly. what i would say is q1 came in slightly better than what we expected on the ramp. so we feel very good about that trajectory. obviously, you know the second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up that business and i would say that the order book, we feel very good about.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah and maybe steve, to build on what bob said. we've said that there is a ramp rate that we've been planning all along. that's what we're seeing. so as you really get into q4, we'll be much more in the run rate, if you will, of what to expect going into financial year 2021 in terms of the frederick site in particular. so it's ramping as planned. it is being utilized. we were happy to produce good product and good revenue from that in this quarter again after starting last quarter and further to what bob said, a lot of these programs and projects are long lead, both working with our customers to really lay the groundwork and do the work. so, though i can't tell you exactly what percentage, i do feel good about the percentage of programs and projects that we're already lining up going into next year.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and steve i could just amplify one of the points that sam made, it was absolutely crucial that those first batches we produce for customers met their expectations. and as you know, we are very cautious in terms of how we started positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right and we've gotten it right for those first few customers. i think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the rest of the year.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that makes a ton of sense. thank you for all the color there. and then mike, i wonder if we could just do the zoom out thing, if you will, where we think about the full year that when there are so many moving parts right and the coronavirus certainly makes it more complicated, but if i rewind to 90 days ago or so, there was a perspective, not necessarily from agilent, but certainly in investor conversations that the outlook for fiscal '20 was really conservative or significantly conservative and i think we've of course heard from you guys over the years outlook that started at one point and you pretty consistently do better than the outlook. i wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outlook and guidance philosophy now that you know 90 days more than you did at the time you gave the outlook at the beginning of the year, to what extent is this middle of the fairway, to what extent is this conservative and could you talk to your customers and you think about the outlook, i mean, how are you feeling and how has that evolved just again really zooming out? thanks so much.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, steve. so, i'm in the conference room zooming out right now and a great question and i think that's how we thought about the full year guide, which i'll leave it to you to prescribe the first adjective. i mean there were proper adjectives, but we started this year with the guide that we thought was relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business and we were actually tracking well in the first quarter where it would have been a beat in both on the revenue and eps side of the quarter albeit the impact of the much talked about today, the impact of the coronavirus. so that's why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say listen, there are still a lot of puts and takes relative to china in the near-term, but there are other aspects of the business are doing extremely well, outside of china whether it be nasd or acg business, the compares and the strength of our lasg instrument portfolio that's gone on ngs. so we have a lot and then back to cell analysis, so we have a lot of confidence and we -- whether we call it a middle of fairway right now, but we feel [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, steve, one thing obviously 90 days ago, we didn't have the epidemic that we're seeing right now which is unprecedented and so what we're trying to do is we're seeing, hey, in the first half of the year, we're expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we're going to make up in the second half of the year. now the question is how fast and we hope for everyone's sake, that that will ramp up fast and we'll get this behind us, but that's certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. we feel good about where our forecast is, but we certainly didn't anticipate that at the beginning of the year.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. i really appreciate the color there. thanks for bearing with me. i appreciate it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, steve. great question.
operator
your next question comes from bill quirk from piper sandler. your line is open.
bill quirk -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thanks. good afternoon, everybody.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, bill.
bill quirk -- piper sandler -- analyst
so i guess bob or mike, just update on m&a, you had mentioned on the last call that would be considering looking at larger deals in and around $1 billion. just curious what the update is?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the statement i made in the last quarterly call, remains which is we think that deploying our capital toward growth and earnings drivers on the m&a front makes a lot of sense for our shareholders in deals that makes sense for us, in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company and we did our largest deal, biotek the past quarter, and as you heard earlier that's off to a really good start. i think we often get the question, well, how large you willing to go and the way, bob and i have described it is listen, we could go maybe multiples of that, but we're not looking to -- we're going to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's magnitude larger than a biotek. so i'm not saying that biotek is the max level, but probably multiples of that as opposed to something that's of a magnitude size.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and bill, as you can appreciate, timing is always very difficult to understand and we're going to remain disciplined and if there isn't anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we're not going to do it, we don't need to do m&a to make our model work, but certainly, you see in the first quarter, the benefit that we've seen with biotek and really building scale in cell analysis, which we think has a long-term growth opportunity for us, not only in lsag, but across the business.
bill quirk -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. and then just secondly, i guess bigger picture question about the pacing of crosslab. over the course of the year we are going to be heading into slightly more difficult comps for the next couple of quarters?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, the beauty of acg has been it's predictability across the business and we're not expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly elevated ramp in china, but that business that mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in terms of providing stable high growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years and i think that that quite honestly is a great legacy to what mark has been able to accomplish and not only that it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so forth. so we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we've talked about in the past.
bill quirk -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good afternoon and welcome to the agilent technologies' first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and now i'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, ankur dhingra, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead. thanks.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, jillian. welcome everyone to agilent's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. with me are mike mcmullen, agilent's president and ceo and bob mcmahon, agilent's senior vice president and cfo. joining in the q&a after bob's comments will be jacob thaysen, president of agilent's life sciences and applied markets group and sam raha, president of agilent's diagnostics and genomics group. due to certain personal engagements, mark doak, president of the agilent crosslab group is unable to join us today. you can find the press release, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com.
today's comments by mike and bob will refer to non-gaap financial measures. you will find the most directly comparable gaap financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. revenue growth will be referred to on either reported or core basis. core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. guidance is based on exchange rates as of january 31st. we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. the company assumes no obligation to update them. please look at the company's recent sec filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. and now i would like to turn the call over to mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur and thanks everyone for joining our call today. i'd like to start today's call with a reminder that mark doak, acg group will be retiring on may 1st. while mark and his wife are currently enjoying a long-planned vacation and he is not able to join us today, i would be remiss in not taking the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments mark has made in his stellar 38-year career. his track record of results speak for itself. thank you, mark. we have a very strong bench at agilent and have already named mark's successor, padraig mcdonnell. padraig knows the business well. he's been on mark's staff for several years and currently runs our chemistries and supplies division. padraig and mark are already working on transition activities as padraig prepares to take the helm of the acd business at the start of fiscal q3. i congratulate both mark and padraig and now onto the quarterly results.
the agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. q1 revenues are above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. total revenues of $1.36 billion are up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. we continued to translate our top line growth into strong bottom line earnings. our eps of $0.81 is up 7%, is at the high-end of our guidance. before going into business unit and market details of our quarterly results, i want to speak about two specific areas that highlight how our building and buying strategy investing in fast growing markets continues to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. first, i want to talk of our most recent acquisition, biotek. this was the first quarter with the biotek team onboard and the business is off to a very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. we continue to be very enthusiastic about the cell analysis space and biotek continues the strong momentum that really got us interested in bringing them into agilent. the biotek leadership team was just in santa clara for a few days of planned meetings and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities of making a great business even stronger as part of agilent.
second, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as agilent delivered strong growth and earnings in the face of a negative q1 impact from the coronavirus outbreak in china. as this has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the coronavirus and its impact on agilent. most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the coronavirus. on the agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact and many returned to work last week. we are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them gradually resume operations. we have also restarted our in-country production activities and they are shipping product to customers within china and internationally albeit at a reduced rate. on the business side, given that our first quarter ended january 31st, we are seeing business impact across both fiscal quarters, q1 and q2. in q1, our revenues were running ahead of expectations right up to lunar new year holiday. however, the extensive lunar new year holiday affected our customers' ability to transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. this reduced our reported revenue by approximately $10 million in total for the quarter primarily in our lsag instrument business. we have since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in q2. looking ahead, we are projecting that coronavirus will continue to impact our china business throughout q2. bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and slower uptake of consumables and services. the slower uptake is due to the reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of lunar new year along with customer and logistics operations that are ramping, but not yet fully operational.
it's important to note, while we're forecasting the impact to our q2 business, our full year outlook for total agilent revenues and eps remains unchanged. our business outside of china remains on a solid footing and we believe a large portion of our china business that's currently being impacted by the coronavirus is not lost, but rather is delayed. as you know, the coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of thousands of people. i'm very proud of how the agilent team is responding to do our part to help. our agilent china team is actively supporting those customers doing crucial research into the virus. we have donated instruments and supplies to four clinical and research institutions based in china to support these research and drug development efforts. we continue to closely monitor events in china and are prepared to act quickly to help wherever possible.
now onto additional details of our quarterly results. agilent's growth is broad-based as our business grew across all regions and end markets. regional performance was led by the americas posting 5% core growth with america coming in with low-single digit results and asia holding steady. despite the timing of the lunar new year and the coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our china business grew low-single digits. while all end markets grew, our results were led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental and forensics markets. now taking a close look at how the individual business units performed. lsag revenues grew 5% on a reported basis driven by strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. on a core basis, lsag's revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected q1 impact from the coronavirus. with the exception of china, all regions and end markets performed in line with expectations. the acg business continues to deliver strong results posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling days in china. this growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. these results continue to demonstrate the strength of our acg crosslab strategy and how we are leading the transformation of the analytical lab. dgg is also posting 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. we experienced a continuation of positive trends winning share in our core pathology business and seeing strength in our ngs qa-qc franchise. we continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo manufacturing facility in frederick, colorado.
in addition to driving strong financial results, i want to highlight some other notable events that took place during the quarter. we continue to bring differential new product to the market gaining strong customer and external recognition. we just introduced the agilent sureselect xt hs2 dna kit. this, along with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, magnus, further strengthens our leadership position in the ngs sample prep market. in addition, industry publication on the agilent infinity lab, lc/msd iq system with [phonetic] 2019 innovation awards. the award winning mass spectrometer introduced last june incorporates intelligent design and innovation such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health. and finally earlier this month, barron's named agilent number one in the list of the 2019 most sustainable companies in america. we're very proud of this recognition. sustainability is a critical topic that's gained an increased interest from customers, employees, and investors. more importantly, we believe focusing on sustainability is simply the right thing to do.
before i pass the call on to bob, i'd like to close with a reminder of agilent's resilience and our shareholder value creation model delivering above market growth, expanding operating margin, and a balanced deployment of capital. we were able to thrive by focus on platforms with multiple large end markets and long-term growth opportunities. we're also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on faster growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of agilent, both organically and inorganically. we do all this while maintaining an acute focus on delivering eps growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation. despite the temporary business uncertainty created by the coronavirus in china, i remain confident about the longer-term growth prospects of the china market, our china growth strategy, and most importantly, our team. i'm very proud and confident in the strength and resiliency of our china team and their ability to overcome any near-term challenges that come our way. when i look at our global team and our business, our growth prospects and team have never been stronger. we are laser focused on driving revenue and earnings growth. i'm pleased to tell you that all these factors allow us to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the year. thanks for being on the call and i look forward to answering your questions. i will now hand off the call to bob. bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, mike and good afternoon everyone. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with our updated guidance for q2 and the full year. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results. our first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets. revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter. as mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the lunar new year holiday due to the coronavirus. this reduced the number of shipping days in china and we estimate shifted $10 million in revenue out of q1. if not for the reduced shipping days in q1, our performance would have been stronger with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points.
in terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our six end market segments. pharma, environmental and forensics, and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. during the quarter, pharma grew 3%; double-digit growth in dgg; and high single-digit growth in acg offset a mid single-digit decline for lsag. within pharma, our biopharma or large molecule segment grew high single-digits and on a geographic basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the americas and mid single-digit growth in europe. this was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in china, largely associated with the timing of the lunar new year and to a lesser extent, the execution of the 4+7 [phonetic] program. the 4+7 program is playing out as we expected with the third round completed in january and multiple winners per drug. we continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves and access to healthcare increases.
our environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%. during the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales. in diagnostics and clinical, revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compare last year. mid single-digit growth in dgg driven by continued share gains in our pathology business were partially offset by declines in lsag and acg with both only having small businesses in this segment. chemical and energy revenue grew 2%, services and consumables grew mid single-digits offset by flat instrument sales. academia and government grew 1% with services and consumables growing mid single-digits partially offset by flat instrument sales. mid single-digit growth in the americas was partially offset by flat to low single-digit declines in the other regions. and finally, food returned to modest growth, up 1%. low-teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation. while one quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continued progress in this market. on a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions led by americas growing mid single-digits; europe grew 2%, in line with our expectations; and as mike mentioned, our business in china was running ahead of expectations through the first two months of fiscal 2020. as mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the $10 million, china still grew 1%. if not for the extension of the lunar new year, our core growth in china would have been solidly mid single-digits.
now let's turn to the rest of the p&l. gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year. this is a result of the planned start-up costs for our new nasd facility as well as product mix and some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. we offset 90 basis points as we leveraged our cost basis and operating expenses, and as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. adjusting for the $10 million coronavirus impact on revenue, operating margins would have increased versus the prior year and so we feel good about our continued opportunity to expand operating margins. we were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. this resulted in non-gaap eps for the quarter coming in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth.
before turning to second quarter guidance, i want to touch on a few other financial metrics. our operating cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the one-time tax outflow of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles as noted last quarter. we also paid out $56 million in dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. we ended the quarter in a net debt position and a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times.
now let's turn to our non-gaap financial guidance for q2. we are anticipating revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. this range is larger than we've traditionally provided as we've intended to estimate an impact of the coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. as this is a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail out our assumptions, particularly as we've seen impact across both q1 and q2. our guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which translates to roughly to a 1.5 week to 3 week impact on china revenues. of this, we saw $10 million in q1 and we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in q2. the q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6% with core growth of 1% to 4%. currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact while m&a is expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. we are estimating the coronavirus to negatively impact our q2 core growth by 1 point to 3 points. our revenue outlook translates to q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share or 1.4% to 7% growth versus last year. importantly, as mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. in addition, our business outside of china remains strong. as such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full year guidance for revenue or eps.
so before starting up the call for questions, i want to conclude by saying we have a very solid start to the year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. it is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of the agilent team that despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year outlook. with that, ankur, back to you for the q&a.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, bob. for q&a, i would like to request to limit to one question and maybe one quick follow-up. so jillian, if you can please provide instructions for q&a.
",2020-Q1,A
1.0,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson of jp morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey. thanks. i'm going to start by asking about the guide. you said china is plateauing. so what i guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured april in the prior quarter. why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? and then, on the covid tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in nasd, does that capture anything around covid manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
do you want to take that bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, tycho. and this is bob. i'll take the question. i'll actually take the second question first around nasd. the nasd growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. it actually had nothing to do with covid-19 testing or research. it's mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we're very pleased with the progress there. so that is, it has nothing to do with the covid-19 testing.
on the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. it's kind of a range of scenarios that we're planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. if you look at, we are expecting may to be very similar to april, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in june and july. and -- but if there are relapses, if china does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. so we're -- it's a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
and on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in c&e and given the volatility in oil prices. how much of a factor that is?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, bob. i'll take that one. so i think for c&e, for q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, q2 and with the potential that the investments that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we're seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. so that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we're assuming kind of current situation continues into q3.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah, tycho. if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus april, they were roughly the same. so we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. it didn't have a material change in april. one of the businesses that did was academia and government. and so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in april than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. and one clarification [speech overlap]
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
sorry, i was going to add too, i think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
and then just one clarification before i hop off on lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? you're kind of abandoning your project. that seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in january. so can you clarify, what changed there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we're thinking about access to the platform. so that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. and bob, i'll let you comment on the financial side of that.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. it is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in q2.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of steve beuchaw of wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks for your time here. i wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. one thing that we've seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. you guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. i wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. and then i have two follow-ups. thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think from an agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we'd like to deploy capital in m&a that makes sense for the company and we've talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we've acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. so i think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the m&a pipeline across the industry. i would also tell you the valuations haven't moved much. so this is not a buyer's market, and you can buy things on the cheap. so you really have to be think through what you're looking at, and it doesn't make sense for the company. anything else to add to that bob? steve, do you have a follow-up or --
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. sorry, i thought, bob might chime in there. but i have two follow-ups. one is, i wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of april snap back. you commented on a specifically in china, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in china, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-china regions. and then one just quick one, i'm curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in crosslab given that crosslab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the crosslab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. thanks so much.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yes. i'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, steve and you're right. what we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. and so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in china that has -- i wouldn't call it a snapback, but it's a recovery. and we're actually seeing the same thing in europe, where europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it's actually coming back faster. and then the us, and now we're starting to see some of the us, it's still very early days in the us, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. and i'll turn it over to padraig to give a chance to talk about the crosslab's business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. and i think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. padraig?
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, agilent and president, agilent crosslab group
yeah. thanks, bob. and i think, yeah, very, very strong demand. we're seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. on the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in china, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. and especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with customers. the last thing i would mention is that also our productivity story in crosslab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. and also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
and steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously acg grew 1%. it would have been stronger several points stronger. we did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we'll come back to us in the course of q3 and q4.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. okay. so this particular quarter was not a good indicator. much appreciate it. thank you very much.

our next question comes from the line of patrick donnelly of citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
yeah. thanks, guys. mike maybe one for you on the c&e segment. certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in april. can you just talk through the exposure there obviously e&p pretty correlated to oil prices. maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, i know typically low oil supply. it feels like at least part of what's going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question. and what we often trying to think that what's really -- we're really behind the lower oil price. and i think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the covid-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. but i'm really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. but over the years, we've continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. so roughly about 70% of our business in c&e is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in april, actually, almost all through all q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our acg business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then maybe on the other side of covid, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. i guess, how do you feel about the c&e segment? does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? what's your outlook, maybe again? not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
in my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. so it's really just tied to events that i'm just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. i think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of c&e business, particularly the covid-19 has exposed the fragility of the world's supply chain. and we're seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.
so we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. but don't get too excited. this -- i would just say, let's assume that it's going to stay subdued for a while, as we're thinking about it right now. hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. and i would say, patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the acg business.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then a very quick cleanup on nasd, following up tycho's question there. do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from covid or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it's kind of addressing?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we are not capacity constrained. and now, we continue to build out the new facility in frederick as well as optimizing our boulder facility. and while i can't share specific names, i can tell you that there are programs under way that aren't in the revenue yet right now that are related to covid-19 work.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks a lot, mike.

our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hello. good afternoon. hi. couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. the nasd base now in 2q, what's that -- where are we in terms of revenues? that was up 35%. i'm just curious on the base.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. it's tracking well to that.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that i think it was around $50-ish million.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, it was about $30 million a year. that was what was kind of forecasted this year. we've spent basically half of that. so the second half of the year, that'll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we're in, in terms of covid-19. hey, bob, i think we had the full cost of the program in our q2 results, in our next quarter results.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
that's correct.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and there's some real talent in that team, and there's some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. so we're looking to go forward that combo approach, as bob mentioned.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
so you mentioned that you're seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. what about the pharmaceutical customers? i mean, obviously, there's a push looking about bringing api manufacturing back, and you're a big player there. and this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. and are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what's happening now between the us and china in terms of your china business?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i'll -- hey derik, this is bob. yes. i'll take the first one, and i'll leave the second one to mike. i think on the pharmaceutical one, we're actually watching that very closely. it's different than the chemical side because i think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. obviously, there's regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the us providing a contract here in the us for some apis and so forth. so we actually think -- we're watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, i think, second to none, and so more to come there. it's probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what i can tell you is, we're actively scenario planning. we -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. so we don't want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. so our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
and if i can squeeze one more in.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
while agilent doesn't do -- you don't supply testing products for covid-19. i mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? and i'm sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? because there's some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. and so i'm just curious in terms of what you're thinking.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. a couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don't provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. so we've -- i've personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. so i think we've got a good feel for the demand that we're seeing out there. relative to our own employees, right now, we're not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.
just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for agilent, are working from home, and we're going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. so we're thinking this through. once more routine testing does become available, that's probably something we would look at pretty closely. but we're in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.
relative -- it's funny. we keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. so we're continuing to monitor. but right now, we're not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right ppe and the right training. but on the testing side, we've not yet seen that.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of dan leonard of wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so hate to overanalyze one month, but i want to circle back to the month of april. so 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we've seen. can you -- you mentioned strength in china. can you quantify china? i mean i was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in april in china. is that in the right ballpark?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yes. you're in the ballpark.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're pretty at good math, dan.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then maybe separately follow-up. mike, it does seem like you don't trust the trend in china and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
dan, thanks for the follow-up question. i do trust the trend in china. so i hope that didn't come through that way in my remarks. so actually...
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. there's the plateau earlier. i wasn't sure.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, no. that was sort of the worst-case scenario that bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. and if it's wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. we don't think we're wrong. but if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that bob described. but in fact, q2 china growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it's going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. and i hope a few of you noticed that the china food also grew in q2.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you for that clarification. [indecipherable]

our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel of cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug. how are you doing?
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
i'm doing well, thank you. so maybe a quick follow-up to dan's question, cutting it in a different way. bob, you said may is going to be similar to april, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that china continues to get better. logically, i think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of april into may. maybe i'm just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. but i'm just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late may?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. but may is trending the way april trended in total. and so we're not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and i think bob, it's -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don't go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both april and through this point in time through may. so, yes.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
that's great. helpful color. regarding acg trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in april and then what was that trend into may. consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. so i'm just wondering, recognizing it's an unusual time, if you'd be willing to go to that level just because it's important for you in the group. and if so, if you'd say anything about specific end markets and geographies?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. and i'll just leave it at that.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
and it's tied directly to the opening a facility.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. you see the consumables recovering. it's recovering much faster than the instrumentation. and that's really -- that's why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can't project exactly how certain facilities will open up. but we know when they opened up in china, we've gotten the business. we know as they've been opening up in europe, we're getting the business. and then when they've slowly been opened up in the us, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren't opening up right now, unless you're doing covid-19 research.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
correct.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay. super, helpful. last one, cell analysis. can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? you had a good quarter. the business grew year-over-year. i think on the surface, that's a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. how are you able to pull that off?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, doug. thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. and i think i'd like to give the opportunity to jacob to crow a little about what's going on there.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent and president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely. thank you very much. and it is actually a good story. i mean, as you say, doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. and furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotek elisa and [indecipherable] in for the theology testing. so with that, that's actually quite good demand. we also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. we see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the covid-19. so overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. we've seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the covid-19. and then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. so overall, great performance.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jacob.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst

mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, puneet. how are you doing?
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks, mike. so the first one on nasd. great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into covid?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sam, i think the answer is no, but i'm going to -- you haven't had a chance to talk today. so why don't you confirm or deny this room or around.
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent and president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. thank you. no, the answer is no, mike. and puneet, that business, it's a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there's a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. so no, there was no stocking work. we've got things scheduled out for months ahead already. so, no stocking effect.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
hey, puneet. this is bob. just to add on to what sam said, because there's been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. we haven't seen any of that in our demand for nasd.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's great to hear. so sam, if i could and mike, you as well, if i could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. now with the decision on lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll make some initial comments, and i'll invite sam to join in here as well. so i guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an ngs perspective. so we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. we're overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for ngs-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. and we think there's a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we're doing that doesn't require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. and sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent and president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. absolutely, mike. as you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of ngs-based cancer diagnostics. we have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to ngs-quality control and so forth. and also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our cdx business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there's partnering opportunities. so puneet, we haven't really changed our thesis. and as mike said earlier, we just don't believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. but our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including ngs continues, and we feel good about it.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and if i could squeeze last one then on the bravo liquid handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the covid testing community as well and genomics community. so trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. and is that something you expect to continue? and if you can -- if there's something you can quantify for along those lines. and i wasn't sure, this is in sam's bucket or it's actually in the lsag bucket.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. hey, puneet. this is bob. i'll tell you it's in the lsag bucket. and that was the majority of the instrument of the covid-19 testing that mike talked about one-point tailwind in q2 and growing. so...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's great. all right, thank you.

vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks guys for squeezing me in here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, vijay. no problem.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
mike, so i think, i just want to make sure i heard this correctly. you guys say april was down 7%, because i'm trying to figure it out, if may is in line with april 6.5%. so if may is, i guess, in line with april or even i guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with april. like how do we get to minus 15%? maybe just help us understand the range?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
it wouldn't -- vijay, you wouldn't, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? so what we're saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn't get any better in the us and europe and we didn't really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in china. so again, we're saying we don't expect that. we hope that that's very conservative. but things are just now opening up in us and europe. but if you do the math that you're saying, you don't get there, you get a lot better. you get toward the minus 5%.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. that's helpful, bob. and then i guess, on that china topic, i know in the past you guys have or i guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- china stimulus. any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't heard any specifics on that. so that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that's not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering china marketplace for us.

brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. mike, i was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. any disruption in places like india or other geographies?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, significant disruption, but it's relatively flattish i think for the quarter, that's about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we -- our business in india is fairly small today.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then just one follow-up for you, bob, just around the p&l. can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, i mean, we've been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. if you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. as we put the brakes on and i would expect that to be probably even more significant in q3. obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. but what i would say is, q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, bob. i could just jump in there. i mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we're really quite pleased with that. and we didn't take shortcuts here. so we -- there was no covid-19 layoffs within agilent. and we've got a team that is not worried about their future employment. they are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.

dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
i was hoping maybe to -- hey, mike, maybe to go back to china for a moment.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
can you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you're seeing in china? i know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and i think you've given some other tidbits. but maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in china and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take it dan. what i would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. all three business groups grew with dgg, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by acg and lsag was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. across the groups all, but i think academia and government grew to varying levels. and food as we talked about was up in china and it helped drive the global food being up. so again, very good recovery there. and we've been very pleased with our performance in china.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
and we throw, bob, and thank you for that. the generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during covid and did major...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. from a generic perspective, pharma was up it's really driven by the biopharma business. but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. as mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in china as well. again, we've got the view that now covid-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we've continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. and nothing really changed in q2 from that standpoint.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
got it.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent and president, life sciences and applied markets group
well, i can add to that. the consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and i know there was already a question i think -- thanks, jacob. and then i know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about dgg ex-nasd business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you're selling there. but can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? so what do we track there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of covid-19 has put a damper on the us business in pathology. so that's one of the areas of ""uncertainty"" we're looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. we saw that resume, i believe bob in europe. but we've not yet seen it in the pathology us business and that puts somewhat of a -- that's put a drag on our q2 results. we were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the us, which we think eventually is going to come back. but again, this is when.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. and dan, that's one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. if in fact, the large labs continue to focus on covid-19 testing or there's not any resumption of non-covid-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren't being done. cancer screening is being deferred. and then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. we're hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. but it's still very early days. ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. and so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. but that's one of the things that is still in front of us.

operator
good afternoon and welcome to the agilent technologies' second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you.
and now i'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, ankur dhingra, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations

today's comments by mike and bob will refer to non-gaap financial measures. you will find the most directly comparable gaap financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and revenue growth will be referred to on a core basis. core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. the company assumes no obligation to update them. please look at the company's recent sec filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.
and now, i'd like to turn the call over to mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur and thanks, everyone for joining our call today. i want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. i'm pleased to have padraig mcdonnel, our president of the agilent crosslab group joining us for the first time today. as i mentioned last quarter, mark doak has retired from the company and padraig is now leading acg. i know you will enjoy getting to know padraig better in his new role and i'm glad he can be here with us on the call.
last quarter, agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of covid-19. since then, much has changed as covid-19 is now a global pandemic. the world is a very different place than it was back in february, but what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the agilent team. early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. we implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. the team is really stepping up. true to the agilent mission, our response to covid-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.
it should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. we are and have been open for business. from the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. we are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering bravo liquid handler systems for their covid-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we're doubling down on efforts to support our customers. this is especially true as their needs change and evolve.
our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong p&l and balance sheet. when we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late march, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. this ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. we also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. we quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. as we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.
bob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. we have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. the positive impact of our approach shows in our q2 results. in the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the agilent team delivered q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. this is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. our q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. we posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.
before covering additional q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the covid-19 impact. we are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. when we all come out of this on the other side, agilent will be poised for growth.
our q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. this is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. an example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we've made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the lasergen sequencer development program.
given changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the ngs diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. as a result, we've made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. we are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we've created into areas of higher interest. despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in ngs cancer diagnostics.
let's now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today's covid-19 world. last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our china team, customers and business. as covid-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. during february and march, our overall business was up about 1%. however, in late march, we faced significant disruption in business activity as europe and the americas restricted access to facilities.
our china business is recovering better than forecasted. we posted 4% core growth in china, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. in fact, in april, china posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. we expect the china growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. the near-term outlook in europe and the us, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non covid-19 diagnostic testing.
some quick highlights across our businesses, both dgg and acg delivered core growth. dgg's 5% growth is driven by nasd, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. acg was up 1%. our lsag business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and covid-19 testing and research. from an end market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical. the food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by china. our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.
in q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. we expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. looking forward, we expect q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into q4. as a key player in the life sciences industry, agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against covid-19.
before closing, i'd like to share a few thoughts on our covid-19 offerings. while the covid-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, agilent is supporting several aspects of covid-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. in q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. there is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.
to address this, we have mobilized a cross agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. these offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, pcr and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. as we enter q3, i want you to know that the global agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. we have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong p&l and balance sheet. we remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.
thank you for being on the call. i will have a few closing comments after bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. and now, bob you're up.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
thank you, mike and good afternoon, everyone. before i begin, i want to repeat what mike and ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. looking forward, i for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about q3.
given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. that said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. on a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. the pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. as we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late march driven by the us and europe. the stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. this lower level of business activity carried through the month of april resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.
on the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in china as restrictions were slowly lifted. we saw strong growth in china in april, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in february and march. overall, china grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of q2. in total for q2, quarter-to-date results through march were up 1%, while april was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.
before getting into some additional group details, it's also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. while there are always some level of cancellation, in both march and april, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. as mike mentioned, dgg and acg both grew on a core basis, while lsag instruments business declined.
lsag declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and covid-19 testing and research in addition, as mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. for lsag, the impact of covid-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. acg grew 1% with china growing in the high-single digits. our acg results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in europe and the americas during the quarter.
and i'm pleased to say that our dgg business delivered 5% growth during q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the us and europe. we saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into covid-19. and as mike mentioned, our nasd ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. the pathology business grew in all regions, except the us, where the effect of delayed in non-covid-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in april. on a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with europe down 4%, americas down 1% and asia pacific, flat. and within asia, as we mentioned china grew 4%.
now let's turn to the rest of the p&l. as the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. we continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. for example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. while we took actions across the p&l, we focused most of our effort on sg&a. r&d investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.
as a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. in addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. this combination of factors resulted in non-gaap eps for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.
now, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. in late march, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. while not in our current plans for q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. we generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. additionally, we've taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.
in addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to ebitda was 0.9 times. given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. as you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-april due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global covid-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. while various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won't be providing guidance for q3 or the full year.
however, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. when we look at q3, we expect may to be very similar to april and the business activity we've seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. we anticipate that china will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. we expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.
a combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. at the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in june and july will continue to improve, with the covid-19 offerings mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in q2. now on the higher end of this decline, we're building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the us and europe, that non-covid-19 testing would not recover, and china would plateau. while this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the us and europe are currently lifting restrictions. we hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.
in q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and m&a should be a 3-point tailwind. again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. as mike said, we also believe that q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. overall, i feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.
before i turn the call back over to mike, i want to conclude by saying agilent's performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. i also want to thank the agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. and, i'd be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. we've taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.
and with that, i believe mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the q&a. mike?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, bob. before we take your questions, i want to close by saying that i couldn't be more proud of our agilent team. the idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at agilent. the team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. i'm absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.
and, with that, i will turn things over to ankur, so we can take your questions. thank you.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
jodi, if you can open the line for q&a, please.
",2020-Q2,A
1.0,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of tycho peterson of jp morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey. thanks. i'm going to start by asking about the guide. you said china is plateauing. so what i guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured april in the prior quarter. why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? and then, on the covid tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in nasd, does that capture anything around covid manufacturing or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
do you want to take that bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, tycho. and this is bob. i'll take the question. i'll actually take the second question first around nasd. the nasd growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. it actually had nothing to do with covid-19 testing or research. it's mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products in clinical testing that has happened, and we're very pleased with the progress there. so that is, it has nothing to do with the covid-19 testing.
on the first question that you had, again this is in guidance. it's kind of a range of scenarios that we're planning and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. if you look at, we are expecting may to be very similar to april, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in june and july. and -- but if there are relapses, if china does relapse or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. so we're -- it's a wider range than we would normally have, but there is obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
and on the uncertainty chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here in c&e and given the volatility in oil prices. how much of a factor that is?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, bob. i'll take that one. so i think for c&e, for q3, basically we assume -- it kind of looks like, q2 and with the potential that the investments that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really caused many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain, so we're seeing early indications of moving of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. so that could represent some upside to our thinking, but basically we're assuming kind of current situation continues into q3.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah, tycho. if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first-two months versus april, they were roughly the same. so we said it was about down 10% in the quarter. it didn't have a material change in april. one of the businesses that did was academia and government. and so academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in april than it was in other markets, but chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter, now albeit down.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. and one clarification [speech overlap]
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
sorry, i was going to add too, i think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in mind about 70% of that segment is actually chemical, including material testing.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
and then just one clarification before i hop off on lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? you're kind of abandoning your project. that seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in january. so can you clarify, what changed there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, actually, you referenced your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space, we're thinking about access to the platform. so that caused us to rethink our current investments and we have an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequential of platform of our own. and bob, i'll let you comment on the financial side of that.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. it is a full shutdown and we will have a write-off in q2.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of steve beuchaw of wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks for your time here. i wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. one thing that we've seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. you guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. i wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. and then i have two follow-ups. thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think from an agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we'd like to deploy capital in m&a that makes sense for the company and we've talked about our criteria around in markets that we know where companies that we've acquired have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive, so that formula remains relatively unchanged, but we have noticed that some of these moves as well. so i think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the m&a pipeline across the industry. i would also tell you the valuations haven't moved much. so this is not a buyer's market, and you can buy things on the cheap. so you really have to be think through what you're looking at, and it doesn't make sense for the company. anything else to add to that bob? steve, do you have a follow-up or --
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. sorry, i thought, bob might chime in there. but i have two follow-ups. one is, i wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of april snap back. you commented on a specifically in china, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect not just in china, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-china regions. and then one just quick one, i'm curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in crosslab given that crosslab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the crosslab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. thanks so much.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yes. i'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, steve and you're right. what we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. and so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in china that has -- i wouldn't call it a snapback, but it's a recovery. and we're actually seeing the same thing in europe, where europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it's actually coming back faster. and then the us, and now we're starting to see some of the us, it's still very early days in the us, but you are seeing kind of that -- that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. and i'll turn it over to padraig to give a chance to talk about the crosslab's business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. and i think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. padraig?
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, agilent and president, agilent crosslab group
yeah. thanks, bob. and i think, yeah, very, very strong demand. we're seeing for example in our service business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be productive and help with start up services and actually achieve a critical component for that customers in the services. on the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in china, a big snap back on in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows and we see this continue. and especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with customers. the last thing i would mention is that also our productivity story in crosslab, but our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. and also, really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
and steve, let me add just one other thing, in the case, obviously acg grew 1%. it would have been stronger several points stronger. we did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth and so that is revenue, that is on the balance sheet today and we'll come back to us in the course of q3 and q4.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. okay. so this particular quarter was not a good indicator. much appreciate it. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of patrick donnelly of citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
yeah. thanks, guys. mike maybe one for you on the c&e segment. certainly encouraging to hear, there was no real deterioration in april. can you just talk through the exposure there obviously e&p pretty correlated to oil prices. maybe on the refining side, how does that reacted to the oil decline, i know typically low oil supply. it feels like at least part of what's going on now is low demand, but maybe going forward?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question. and what we often trying to think that what's really -- we're really behind the lower oil price. and i think this time you got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the covid-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. but i'm really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. but over the years, we've continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. so roughly about 70% of our business in c&e is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in april, actually, almost all through all q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our acg business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then maybe on the other side of covid, obviously, academic of labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. i guess, how do you feel about the c&e segment? does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? what's your outlook, maybe again? not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next six months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback with?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
in my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. so it's really just tied to events that i'm just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. i think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of c&e business, particularly the covid-19 has exposed the fragility of the world's supply chain. and we're seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.
so we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. but don't get too excited. this -- i would just say, let's assume that it's going to stay subdued for a while, as we're thinking about it right now. hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. and i would say, patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the acg business.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then a very quick cleanup on nasd, following up tycho's question there. do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from covid or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it's kind of addressing?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we are not capacity constrained. and now, we continue to build out the new facility in frederick as well as optimizing our boulder facility. and while i can't share specific names, i can tell you that there are programs under way that aren't in the revenue yet right now that are related to covid-19 work.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks a lot, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you are quite welcome.

our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hello. good afternoon. hi. couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. the nasd base now in 2q, what's that -- where are we in terms of revenues? that was up 35%. i'm just curious on the base.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. it's tracking well to that.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the lasergen money into the business or is that going to drop through? are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were spending on that i think it was around $50-ish million.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, it was about $30 million a year. that was what was kind of forecasted this year. we've spent basically half of that. so the second half of the year, that'll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we're in, in terms of covid-19. hey, bob, i think we had the full cost of the program in our q2 results, in our next quarter results.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
that's correct.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and there's some real talent in that team, and there's some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. so we're looking to go forward that combo approach, as bob mentioned.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
so you mentioned that you're seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. what about the pharmaceutical customers? i mean, obviously, there's a push looking about bringing api manufacturing back, and you're a big player there. and this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. and are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what's happening now between the us and china in terms of your china business?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i'll -- hey derik, this is bob. yes. i'll take the first one, and i'll leave the second one to mike. i think on the pharmaceutical one, we're actually watching that very closely. it's different than the chemical side because i think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. obviously, there's regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the us providing a contract here in the us for some apis and so forth. so we actually think -- we're watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, i think, second to none, and so more to come there. it's probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what i can tell you is, we're actively scenario planning. we -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. so we don't want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. so our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
and if i can squeeze one more in.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
while agilent doesn't do -- you don't supply testing products for covid-19. i mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? and i'm sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? because there's some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. and so i'm just curious in terms of what you're thinking.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. a couple of things right now, so first of all, although we don't provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. so we've -- i've personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. so i think we've got a good feel for the demand that we're seeing out there. relative to our own employees, right now, we're not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the office.
just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for agilent, are working from home, and we're going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. so we're thinking this through. once more routine testing does become available, that's probably something we would look at pretty closely. but we're in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.
relative -- it's funny. we keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. so we're continuing to monitor. but right now, we're not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right ppe and the right training. but on the testing side, we've not yet seen that.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of dan leonard of wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so hate to overanalyze one month, but i want to circle back to the month of april. so 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we've seen. can you -- you mentioned strength in china. can you quantify china? i mean i was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in april in china. is that in the right ballpark?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yes. you're in the ballpark.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're pretty at good math, dan.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then maybe separately follow-up. mike, it does seem like you don't trust the trend in china and how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
dan, thanks for the follow-up question. i do trust the trend in china. so i hope that didn't come through that way in my remarks. so actually...
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. there's the plateau earlier. i wasn't sure.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, no. that was sort of the worst-case scenario that bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. and if it's wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. we don't think we're wrong. but if in case we were wrong, this is -- you see that far end of the framework that bob described. but in fact, q2 china growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it's going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. and i hope a few of you noticed that the china food also grew in q2.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you for that clarification. [indecipherable]
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
operator
our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel of cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug. how are you doing?
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
i'm doing well, thank you. so maybe a quick follow-up to dan's question, cutting it in a different way. bob, you said may is going to be similar to april, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that china continues to get better. logically, i think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of april into may. maybe i'm just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. but i'm just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late may?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right, but -- or one point out of a year. but may is trending the way april trended in total. and so we're not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and i think bob, it's -- maybe this is worth mentioning that we don't go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both april and through this point in time through may. so, yes.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
that's great. helpful color. regarding acg trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in april and then what was that trend into may. consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. so i'm just wondering, recognizing it's an unusual time, if you'd be willing to go to that level just because it's important for you in the group. and if so, if you'd say anything about specific end markets and geographies?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. and i'll just leave it at that.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
and it's tied directly to the opening a facility.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. you see the consumables recovering. it's recovering much faster than the instrumentation. and that's really -- that's why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can't project exactly how certain facilities will open up. but we know when they opened up in china, we've gotten the business. we know as they've been opening up in europe, we're getting the business. and then when they've slowly been opened up in the us, but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren't opening up right now, unless you're doing covid-19 research.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
correct.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay. super, helpful. last one, cell analysis. can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? you had a good quarter. the business grew year-over-year. i think on the surface, that's a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. how are you able to pull that off?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, doug. thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. and i think i'd like to give the opportunity to jacob to crow a little about what's going on there.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent and president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely. thank you very much. and it is actually a good story. i mean, as you say, doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. and furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the biotek elisa and [indecipherable] in for the theology testing. so with that, that's actually quite good demand. we also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. we see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in -- relates to the covid-19. so overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. we've seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the covid-19. and then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. so overall, great performance.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jacob.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, again.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

and our next question comes from the line of puneet souda of svb leerink. please go ahead. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hi, mike. first one on nasd.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, puneet. how are you doing?
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks, mike. so the first one on nasd. great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into covid?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sam, i think the answer is no, but i'm going to -- you haven't had a chance to talk today. so why don't you confirm or deny this room or around.
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent and president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. thank you. no, the answer is no, mike. and puneet, that business, it's a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there's a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. so no, there was no stocking work. we've got things scheduled out for months ahead already. so, no stocking effect.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
hey, puneet. this is bob. just to add on to what sam said, because there's been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. we haven't seen any of that in our demand for nasd.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's great to hear. so sam, if i could and mike, you as well, if i could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. now with the decision on lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll make some initial comments, and i'll invite sam to join in here as well. so i guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an ngs perspective. so we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. we're overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for ngs-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. and we think there's a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we're doing that doesn't require a -- or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. and sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent and president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. absolutely, mike. as you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of ngs-based cancer diagnostics. we have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to ngs-quality control and so forth. and also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our cdx business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from -- we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there's partnering opportunities. so puneet, we haven't really changed our thesis. and as mike said earlier, we just don't believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. but our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including ngs continues, and we feel good about it.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and if i could squeeze last one then on the bravo liquid handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the covid testing community as well and genomics community. so trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. and is that something you expect to continue? and if you can -- if there's something you can quantify for along those lines. and i wasn't sure, this is in sam's bucket or it's actually in the lsag bucket.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. hey, puneet. this is bob. i'll tell you it's in the lsag bucket. and that was the majority of the instrument of the covid-19 testing that mike talked about one-point tailwind in q2 and growing. so...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay. that's great. all right, thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of vijay kumar of evercore isi. please go ahead. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks guys for squeezing me in here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, vijay. no problem.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
mike, so i think, i just want to make sure i heard this correctly. you guys say april was down 7%, because i'm trying to figure it out, if may is in line with april 6.5%. so if may is, i guess, in line with april or even i guess, if the next -- forward two months are in line with april. like how do we get to minus 15%? maybe just help us understand the range?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
it wouldn't -- vijay, you wouldn't, that would be kind of the -- toward the lower end, right? so what we're saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn't get any better in the us and europe and we didn't really have -- there was a sort of a backtrack in china. so again, we're saying we don't expect that. we hope that that's very conservative. but things are just now opening up in us and europe. but if you do the math that you're saying, you don't get there, you get a lot better. you get toward the minus 5%.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. that's helpful, bob. and then i guess, on that china topic, i know in the past you guys have or i guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus -- china stimulus. any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we haven't heard any specifics on that. so that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that's not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering china marketplace for us.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thanks guys.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of brandon couillard of jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. mike, i was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. any disruption in places like india or other geographies?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, significant disruption, but it's relatively flattish i think for the quarter, that's about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. we -- our business in india is fairly small today.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then just one follow-up for you, bob, just around the p&l. can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about opex trends into the third quarter?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, i mean, we've been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. if you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. as we put the brakes on and i would expect that to be probably even more significant in q3. obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. but what i would say is, q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, bob. i could just jump in there. i mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we're really quite pleased with that. and we didn't take shortcuts here. so we -- there was no covid-19 layoffs within agilent. and we've got a team that is not worried about their future employment. they are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of dan brennan of ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, dan.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
i was hoping maybe to -- hey, mike, maybe to go back to china for a moment.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
can you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you're seeing in china? i know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and i think you've given some other tidbits. but maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in china and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. i'll take it dan. what i would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. all three business groups grew with dgg, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by acg and lsag was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. across the groups all, but i think academia and government grew to varying levels. and food as we talked about was up in china and it helped drive the global food being up. so again, very good recovery there. and we've been very pleased with our performance in china.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
and we throw, bob, and thank you for that. the generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during covid and did major...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. from a generic perspective, pharma was up it's really driven by the biopharma business. but our small molecule was not significantly impacted. as mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in china as well. again, we've got the view that now covid-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we've continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. and nothing really changed in q2 from that standpoint.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
got it.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent and president, life sciences and applied markets group
well, i can add to that. the consolidation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and i know there was already a question i think -- thanks, jacob. and then i know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about dgg ex-nasd business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive toward discretionary visits given the nature of what you're selling there. but can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? so what do we track there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think actually, hospital access for -- and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of covid-19 has put a damper on the us business in pathology. so that's one of the areas of ""uncertainty"" we're looking at is when will those -- when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. we saw that resume, i believe bob in europe. but we've not yet seen it in the pathology us business and that puts somewhat of a -- that's put a drag on our q2 results. we were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the us, which we think eventually is going to come back. but again, this is when.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
yeah. and dan, that's one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. if in fact, the large labs continue to focus on covid-19 testing or there's not any resumption of non-covid-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren't being done. cancer screening is being deferred. and then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. we're hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. but it's still very early days. ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. and so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. but that's one of the things that is still in front of us.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. thank you, guys.

operator
good afternoon and welcome to the agilent technologies' second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you.
and now i'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, ankur dhingra, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, jodi, and welcome everyone to agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. i hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. on the webcast today are mike mcmullen, agilent's president and ceo; and bob mcmahon, agilent's senior vice president and cfo. joining for the q&a after prepared remarks will be jacob thaysen, president of agilent's life science and applied markets group; and sam raha, president of agilent's diagnostics and genomics group, along with padraig mcdonnell, president of the agilent crosslab group. you can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com.
today's comments by mike and bob will refer to non-gaap financial measures. you will find the most directly comparable gaap financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and revenue growth will be referred to on a core basis. core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. the company assumes no obligation to update them. please look at the company's recent sec filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.
and now, i'd like to turn the call over to mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur and thanks, everyone for joining our call today. i want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. i'm pleased to have padraig mcdonnel, our president of the agilent crosslab group joining us for the first time today. as i mentioned last quarter, mark doak has retired from the company and padraig is now leading acg. i know you will enjoy getting to know padraig better in his new role and i'm glad he can be here with us on the call.
last quarter, agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of covid-19. since then, much has changed as covid-19 is now a global pandemic. the world is a very different place than it was back in february, but what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the agilent team. early on we instituted a global work from home policy and severely restricted travel. we implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. the team is really stepping up. true to the agilent mission, our response to covid-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.
it should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is an unwavering commitment to our customers. we are and have been open for business. from the early stages of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. we are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities for remote technical assistance, to urgently delivering bravo liquid handler systems for their covid-19 tests, or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning, we're doubling down on efforts to support our customers. this is especially true as their needs change and evolve.
our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong p&l and balance sheet. when we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late march, we made changes in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. this ensured continuity of order in-take and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. we also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses. we quickly put in-place a cost management program while reprioritizing and sustaining our growth investments. as we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.
bob will share more details, but a top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. we have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. the positive impact of our approach shows in our q2 results. in the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the agilent team delivered q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. this is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. our q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. we posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter flat versus our results a year ago.
before covering additional q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place, while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the covid-19 impact. we are continuing to prioritize investments in fast growing markets, such as biopharma, that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. when we all come out of this on the other side, agilent will be poised for growth.
our q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. this is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. our approach investing for growth continues to serve us well and will be a major factor in helping us emerge from the current environment stronger than ever. an example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we've made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the lasergen sequencer development program.
given changes in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the ngs diagnostics space without the need for our own sequencer platform. as a result, we've made the decision to shutter our sequencer development program. we are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we've created into areas of higher interest. despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in ngs cancer diagnostics.
let's now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today's covid-19 world. last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our china team, customers and business. as covid-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. during february and march, our overall business was up about 1%. however, in late march, we faced significant disruption in business activity as europe and the americas restricted access to facilities.
our china business is recovering better than forecasted. we posted 4% core growth in china, with increasing strength throughout the quarter. in fact, in april, china posted strong growth while all other geographies experienced declines. we expect the china growth recovery to continue throughout the year, as lab operations and investment continue to resume. the near-term outlook in europe and the us, however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment purchases across most end-markets and non covid-19 diagnostic testing.
some quick highlights across our businesses, both dgg and acg delivered core growth. dgg's 5% growth is driven by nasd, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. acg was up 1%. our lsag business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis, and covid-19 testing and research. from an end market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical. the food market continued its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by china. our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter.
in q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. we expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although, we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally, as some customers shift supply chains. looking forward, we expect q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into q4. as a key player in the life sciences industry, agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against covid-19.
before closing, i'd like to share a few thoughts on our covid-19 offerings. while the covid-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, agilent is supporting several aspects of covid-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. in q2, this resulted in a one point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. there is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters.
to address this, we have mobilized a cross agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. these offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, pcr and microplate testing, to consumables and components necessary for testing, as well as lab support to these customers. as we enter q3, i want you to know that the global agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. we have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong p&l and balance sheet. we remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth.
thank you for being on the call. i will have a few closing comments after bob speaks and then we look forward to taking your questions. and now, bob you're up.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, agilent chief financial officer
thank you, mike and good afternoon, everyone. before i begin, i want to repeat what mike and ankur said in hoping you are all doing well and staying safe. looking forward, i for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about q3.
given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we are not going to provide specific forward-looking guidance today. that said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process on how things may play out in the coming quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. on a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. the pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region, driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow the spread of the virus. as we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late march driven by the us and europe. the stay-at-home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. this lower level of business activity carried through the month of april resulting in double-digit declines for the month in those regions.
on the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in china as restrictions were slowly lifted. we saw strong growth in china in april, partially due to catch-up from lower business volumes in february and march. overall, china grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of q2. in total for q2, quarter-to-date results through march were up 1%, while april was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline.
before getting into some additional group details, it's also important to note, while we have seen order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. while there are always some level of cancellation, in both march and april, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. as mike mentioned, dgg and acg both grew on a core basis, while lsag instruments business declined.
lsag declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and covid-19 testing and research in addition, as mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. for lsag, the impact of covid-19 related closures was most pronounced in the academia and government, and chemical and energy markets. acg grew 1% with china growing in the high-single digits. our acg results were negatively affected by delays in installations and lab closures in europe and the americas during the quarter.
and i'm pleased to say that our dgg business delivered 5% growth during q2 and was on track for double-digit growth, prior to the slowdown in the us and europe. we saw a sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into covid-19. and as mike mentioned, our nasd ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. the pathology business grew in all regions, except the us, where the effect of delayed in non-covid-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in april. on a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with europe down 4%, americas down 1% and asia pacific, flat. and within asia, as we mentioned china grew 4%.
now let's turn to the rest of the p&l. as the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. we continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. for example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. while we took actions across the p&l, we focused most of our effort on sg&a. r&d investments, as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year.
as a result, operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more toward services. in addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. this combination of factors resulted in non-gaap eps for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with the number we posted a year ago.
now, in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. in late march, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. while not in our current plans for q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. we generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. additionally, we've taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year.
in addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. our net leverage ratio is defined by net debt to ebitda was 0.9 times. given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. as you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-april due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global covid-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. while various countries have started working toward reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown, so we won't be providing guidance for q3 or the full year.
however, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. when we look at q3, we expect may to be very similar to april and the business activity we've seen in the first weeks of the month confirm that. we anticipate that china will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. we expect pharma, and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of service revenue to remain resilient and we will also be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns.
a combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. at the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in june and july will continue to improve, with the covid-19 offerings mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1% contribution in q2. now on the higher end of this decline, we're building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter, in the us and europe, that non-covid-19 testing would not recover, and china would plateau. while this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the us and europe are currently lifting restrictions. we hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative, but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward.
in q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and m&a should be a 3-point tailwind. again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. as mike said, we also believe that q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. overall, i feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers.
before i turn the call back over to mike, i want to conclude by saying agilent's performance for the -- the first-two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. i also want to thank the agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. and, i'd be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. we've taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.
and with that, i believe mike you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the q&a. mike?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, bob. before we take your questions, i want to close by saying that i couldn't be more proud of our agilent team. the idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at agilent. the team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, and even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. i'm absolutely convinced that we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.
and, with that, i will turn things over to ankur, so we can take your questions. thank you.

certainly. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of doug schenkel with cowen. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys. and --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug. how are you doing?
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
i am doing well. nice work in a tough environment.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
can you just start with a clean-up question right off the bat and i [technical issues] remarks prepared remarks. i don't think you quantified covid-19 tailwinds in the quarter. again, i may have missed that, but it just would be helpful to get that so we could try to normalize [technical issues].
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, dough. i touched on it briefly in my comments, but it was 2 points of reported growth in q3.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. that's great. and then on china just a couple, i'm just curious if you would share the exit rate. and as we look ahead, i know you're not guiding, i'm just wondering if you think based on what you're seeing, if you think that double-digit growth can be sustained from here, at least near term? and then specific on food, it's great to see that return to solid [technical issues] seeing some stabilization last quarter. can the high single-digit growth rate you saw this quarter be sustained moving forward given favorable multi-year comparisons? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug. thanks. thanks for those questions. so just to make sure it came through the audience. the question was about our view on the growth rate of china for the rest of the year as well as can that high single-digit growth rate in food be sustained. we think the answer is yes on both. we're really pleased with our performance in china. it was broad based. i tried to really accentuate that in my comments. we saw basically double-digit growth across all end markets in china. and we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for q4 in china. and i have to say, doug, it's wonderful to be talking about the china food from a different vector. we've been talking about it probably the last 18 to 24 months of when that would return to growth. we saw some early indications in q2. we saw a strong q3. and we think that that are all numbers probably sustainable for the rest of this year. wouldn't you say so, bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would just say that -- doug, to add, i mean one of the things that was very -- very positive about china was it was pretty consistent across the quarter and in fact exited slightly higher than that overall 11%. but we saw solid growth all three months.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you again.

your next question comes from the line of vijay kumar with evercore isi. your line is open.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, vijay.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks -- hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. mike or bob, just maybe on the guidance here. if i step back, the third quarter guidance, we're down mid-single to down mid-teens. this down low-single was up. came in well above expectations, i would say, perhaps not surprising than peers [phonetic] but nonetheless solid execution. the q4 down 4% to plus 1% implies declines. what could cause the declines just given -- in light of pretty good [phonetic] performance? is that the minus 4% at the low end? is that assuming that july tend to just sustain in this new improvement on display and how you are thinking of q4?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. vijay, this is bob. i'll take that. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that that is overly conservative. what that would imply is actually a retrenchment and -- when covid-19 flare ups here in the us as we go back, as we move into the fall and you start seeing some elements of shutdown. so we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. but we wanted to provide, hey, that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth.
our july results or our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. and so we're aiming to do better. but there is still uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth. so --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and, bob, i think it's probably fair to say the wildcard is the united states, right?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. absolutely.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and we were encouraged by the movement in pmi. you probably noticed that, but let's see how that translates into business in the upcoming quarter. and again we have to keep in mind ourselves, as pleased as we are with the results we just delivered, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there because the virus is unpredictable at times.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. that's right, mike. i mean if you looked at our each one of the major markets, each one of the major markets got better in q3 versus q2 with the exception of the us, which we expected given kind of the state of the -- state of affairs with the pandemic.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's a helpful perspective. so the minus 4% implies that things get worse. was july up, flattish or positive? and i'm curious, mike you mentioned nasd doubling up oligo. i know if you turn back to page we were doubling capacity. so is this now versus six months of a quadrupling capacity versus where we were last year? is that the right way to think about revenues going from $100 million, $200 million to perhaps $400 million? is that's the math here?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, slightly different math. i think we've been -- i think we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our capacity. what we ended up doing was actually triggering the decision to initiate the expansion earlier than we had thought, just given the robust nature of the end market and as well as we have worked our way to be able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same physical space. so we are investing a little bit more in capital than we initially thought, but we're also building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume than our current train -- train a. so it's a really -- we thought it was a really positive signal and that's why we sent out the press release this morning, because we're super excited about our prospects here.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. vijay, let me kind of frame in the -- kind of the numbers. what we were talking about is the frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue and we added capacity that more than doubles that $100 million to give you a frame of the numbers. so it's not $100 million, $200 million, $400 million, it's $100 million, $200 million and more than $300 million to kind of give you a sense. and in terms of july, we actually came in with growth across all three groups in exiting july.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, guys. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jp morgan. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey. thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, tycho.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
i'll start with the covid -- hi. i'll start with the covid commentary. i guess if i go back to last quarter, there was some talk about launching the serology test. you guys obviously have an installed base of real-time pcr instruments. we've gotten questions of why you have to launch a pcr test. so can you talk a little bit about how you think about those tailwinds going forward and how you think about your capabilities on the diagnostics side?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, tycho, i'll make some initial comments and then the group president has been kind of quiet today. so i'll pull sam in here as well to provide his perspective. but we think that there is still tailwinds in front of us. and now 2 points of growth and we think we can sustain that at a minimum, that's why i try to put fairly bullish comments about our stepped-up efforts across the company. some of these things are going to take a little bit longer. we think there's still room for our own test, a quality test with some different features. but i think maybe a few comments there, sam, from your perspective.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yes, sure, mike. hi tycho. as you -- i think you'd have seen a good pickup in terms of our qpcr instruments, which are rf systems as well as our bioreagents related to qpcr, both reverse transcriptase and master mixes. on the antibody side, we've definitely also seen an increase in iga, igg and those antibodies.
in terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. so more to share in due course.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and, tycho, i guess what i disclose off here is the broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play in multiple aspects of this covid-19. some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into revenue, right? so if you're working with, say, a pharma partner on something in the therapeutic area, it may take a while for that to come to market. so we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time and we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
i guess that's a good segue on the nasd expansion. can you maybe talk to what degree that's tied to the covid vaccine? and any update from your end on capabilities on apis for mrna or sirna vaccines?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
do you want to take that one, sam?
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. sure. sure, no problem. tycho, i'd start by reiterating a little bit of what mike and bob were talking about. it's interesting that it was just last june that we did a ribbon cutting and starting of the new frederick, colorado facility and quite frankly we've seen demand that exceeded our expectation just 12 months ago. so the building really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider it, as we call it, train a on steroids. [indecipherable] but it is very differentiated both in throughput and the molecules that it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we are -- we are able to do multiple iterations or types of sirna or rna. we're also actively looking at other different versions of molecules that are oligo based. though i can't reveal the details we have had a lot of interest related to covid-19. all of those used for either covid-19 related therapeutics or even for vaccines. so i can say that we have started to work on some of those programs now.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. and maybe sam to add, that being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to covid-19. we have plenty of demand outside of covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines and -- so this is a broad based capacity expansion.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you, bob. okay and then -- and then just last one, i know we don't have official guidance but there is a framework for the quarter, for the fourth quarter. as we think about c&a and then also pharma biotech, should we expect any kind of material change in either of those end markets for the coming quarter? i know you talked about reshoring activities for c&e. i wasn't sure if that would maybe cause an improvement in trajectory there. thanks.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, probably -- c&e is probably the one that's -- i would expect it to be pretty stable in that down 10%-ish, 8% to 10% in the range. we do expect pharma to continue to improve. so that 2% certainly even in the low scenario would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of q3.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and, tycho, the supply chain considerations and discussions still happen. i think it added a level of stability, albeit down to this -- into this space. and again as you look ahead for the future, this is an area where eventually it will come back. and again too early to call. and -- but i'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in pharma.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, the way to think about those reassuring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen through the order book and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of as the investments are being made. so this is -- that's more future looking.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, bob.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of puneet souda with leerink. your line is open.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
yeah. hi, mike, bob.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, puneet.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
thanks for -- thanks, mike. so first question is on just nasd, obviously strong in the quarter. but that would imply dako and clinical business. obviously you pointed that out. it was down in the quarter, but that's a significant decline. maybe just could you parse that out for us? what is -- it's a covid impact for sure, but is there anything beyond that in terms of the way market is fundamentally potentially shifting here to ngs maybe? and if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit of that and clarify. thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to do so. it's all market. it's all access to labs and patients going for their diagnostic test. so it's really all market. i think we're seeing different pace of -- pacing throughout the quarter. all of our geographies on the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in july, but it was down sharply in may -- in june, particularly in the us. and keep in mind also, we -- part of our business in our genomics front is sureselect into ngs based diagnostic labs. and for genetic disorders, for example, those tests aren't getting done either. so it's really all market.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i was going to say, puneet, actually if you bifurcate those two and look at our performance actually pathology performed better than ngs testing for volumes given what mike was just talking about, as well as some of the academic institutions.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good point, bob. thanks.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and if you could -- i know you quantified last quarter bravo contribution. i'm wondering if you can provide that for bravo/magnis liquid handling systems sort of how much of that contribution happen in the quarter?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's part of the story for our covid-19 tailwinds. and i think probably the biggest contribution this quarter actually came from biotech, bob, if i remember correctly.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
between biotech and the liquid handling -- bravo. so it's kind of now we have like a one, two-punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation. and that also reminds me with the platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the tips that go with those liquid handlers.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
okay. and last one on just acg. i mean could you just elaborate on in these times you mentioned there are some larger contracts that -- service contracts and lights that you're getting into. sort of what -- are those sort of covid driven, what is -- what's behind those and maybe if you can elaborate on the geography there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, puneet, happy to have padraig jump in on here and provide his perspective on that. so padraig, in the call script i talk a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. so why don't you talk about that, a little more detail.
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, president, agilent crosslab group
yeah. so thanks, mike. we launched our crosslab asset monitoring service which has seen a big uptick and what we're seeing from customers is a large demand for sourcing from one vendor and because of our capabilities in terms of the asset monitoring capability, relocation services and our core delivery services which are extremely in strong demand, we're seeing a big uptake from large customers in that. we expect that to continue as we go through the quarter -- next quarter.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, now, i was going to say in the geography, puneet, is largely in the us, but there are some global opportunities as well. it's really non-covid-19 related. i mean this is part of the core growth strategy for padraig's business to continue to expand our market share on the enterprise service front and we're really delighted winning some big pharma deals.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin with bank of america. your line is open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. so a couple of questions. very impressive margin expansion in the third quarter. how should we think about the operating margin into q4? and then i guess how much of these costs are permanent removals versus what has to come back in '21?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, let me just -- let me take that, derik. great questions. and certainly are very pleased with how the team has responded, as i mentioned before. as we've talked about a large amount of the cost, we have not done things like furloughs. we stabilized the team. we have not reduced base pay and things like that. so these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them we think have the opportunity to stay away. it would be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our customers. and so there aren't any kind of one-time things that happened in the quarter.
in terms of going forward to q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy recovers. we also have some started some start-up costs in the nasd new facility as well. so it's probably less than what you -- what we've had historically had, which is call it 32% incrementals, but it's really to drive growth.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bob, i could just maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. so this is really, derik, all about a new way of working in agilent. so i am preparing for a managers call later this week and what we're talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. and we're really going to make sure that when we get on the other side of this covid-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our always of traveling. and we know from our customer satisfaction scores they love the responses that we have now with our digital platforms.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and two questions on lasg. [phonetic] i guess the first question is if you look at your numbers in china versus some of your major peers in that area, i mean you've really outshown in china. can you just talk about just share dynamics there that are going on? i mean as i said, there was a pretty stark comparison between you and your main lc competitor there. and i guess also along those lines, can you talk about potentially any sign of a budget -- any sign of a budget flush and just sort of thinking about four key trends, what are you hearing in terms of people with budgets? and are they going to be allowed to roll things over and to -- or are they going to have to use it or lose it?
just some dynamics in terms of growth on the fourth quarter and just sort of your general thoughts on where customer spending habits are.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, derik. i'm going to have jacob handle the first question then, jacob, you can pass it back to bob and i for the second question. and i know jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share dynamics in china, which we think are very positive for agilent.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely. thanks for that and the numbers speak for itself. it's clear that both in china but i think actually globally that we are in right now will be taking care. and this doesn't come by coincidence. i think we have been executing our strategy between deals and over the past years. and the customers are really buying into our value proposition. we are playing a game where we are leveraging our whole portfolio, not going after one product line versus each other and the customer really likes to be outcome-based. so that's what is happening right now. and we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about what the investments we have done into our portfolio over the past year but also, as mike talked about, in the digital world, in the remote world, we have been -- our team has just been super responsive. they have taken up the digital. we take talent very very good and the customers have responded very, very positive to it. they know that when they work with agilent that we are there for them in this crisis. so thank you, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and then, on the other question, derik, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in the public sector and we're seeing it in our order book, and bob i'll offer my perspective here, and feel free to build on my comments here. but, there's a real sense of making sure they commit to their budgets. so, we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there is a lot of uncertainty what's going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. so, they want to commit those funds. and it's actually quite amazing the amount of deal activity that's going to occur without visiting a customer face-to-face. so bob, i don't know what you're hearing from field [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
the only thing i would add is just reiterate what jacob was saying, because it's not just china. i think, when you look at our lsag portfolio, i think what people don't fully appreciate is, is how we've actually changed the portfolio to technology platforms, they're probably the best -- in the best shape they have been in probably five years in terms of new products and so forth. and i think you're seeing that across the globe. and when we think about where we ended up in q3, lsag was certainly the standout relative to where we thought they were going to be. in a capital constrained environment only down 4% on a core basis really speaks to our -- i think, our responsiveness to customers.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks.

your next question comes from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies. please go ahead.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
hey. good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, brandon.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
bob, on the gross margin line, you mentioned higher logistics cost in the third quarter. is that a new trend? and then, could you help us just think through some of the puts and takes, whether it's logistics costs or mix and how those puts and takes might evolve in the fourth quarter?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. sure. we're hoping that's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was exacerbated in the q3. that being said, i would say three quarters of that was probably mix, when you look at the various businesses across each one of the groups. but, where we saw logistics, challenges are, just lower capacity in freight -- in air capacity. but we would expect that -- and we actually saw that through the quarter to kind of relax. and i think as you're starting to see more intercontinental travel, both from a passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint we would expect that to kind of relax over time.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
okay. and then, bob or mike, you're not quite giving formal forward-looking guidance yet, but you do feel comfortable enough to restart the buyback program. just what are your latest thoughts just around comfort as far as capital deployment goes and maybe your appetite for m&a right now and what the funnel might look like there? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, brandon. and i'll start off here, and bob, feel free to jump in. but, we felt quite comfortable resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at opportunistic as well. and cash flow remains strong. we felt for some time that the third quarter of this year would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. we're through that now. and the third quarter actually was significantly better than we had thought. and we saw positive growth across all of our businesses in july. so, we think, ok, barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this gradual improvement of growth into the fourth quarter, sort of our message. so, we have the comp. we also narrowed the framework that we provided, it's more narrower than it was in q3. but again, i think we need to keep reminding ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the pandemic.
i think, our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is, we certainly wanted a balanced approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash, share repos and with the prioritization of investment in business, we just made a significant commitment in capital with our new nasd expansion. and we're still on the hunt for deals that make sense for agilent. so, our approach to capital deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. we paused a bit in the second quarter just because -- on the share repo because of the -- in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on in the environment outside of agilent. so, we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a reasonable level of confidence and there is decent level of stability about the business.
bob anything --

your next question comes from the line of dan leonard with wells fargo. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, dan.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
so, maybe just to circle back -- hi mike. so, maybe this is a question for bob, talking again about the q4 framework.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
[speech overlap]
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
so, if your business grew in july and the world improves month to month through october, what does that imply then the high end should be above that 1% organic growth number?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
it could be. i'll just leave it at that. there's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. but certainly, we wouldn't complain if it was better than that.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then, my follow-up, whoever wants to take it, on the nasd business. can you elaborate on, what's the lead time for that announced expansion? is it something that would take a year or multiple years to put in the new line, or is it a quicker turn? and can you comment on your willingness to commit capital inorganically in that business in addition to your organic commitments? thank you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
i'll take the first one just real quick and then, mike, if you want to add something on the second one. we announced that we would make that $150 million investment and we would expect it to go live toward the end of 2022. so, it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. sam mentioned train a on steroids. so, it's bigger, and probably take a little more capital. and obviously with covid-19 there's some activity there in terms of a little long lead time. but, we feel like we have the capacity to be able to manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, it's probably end of '22. and don't specifically talk about specific targets or areas of focus necessarily, but it's not out of the realm of reason that i would say, why wouldn't we want to further expand this business inorganically as well? so, that's not out of the realm. i'm not singling anything near-term happening. but we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this business. we had a first -- get our new factory up and running and build for that. so, we now think we have a, if you will, a beachhead to build from both, organically and inorganically.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of catherine schulte with baird. your line is open.
catherine ramsay -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for the question.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
[speech overlap]
catherine ramsay -- robert w. baird -- analyst
i guess, first, despite the relatively good lsag results in the quarter, it sounds like the outlook on the capital equipment side is still a bit uncertain. can you just talk to how the services and consumable side of the business trended in july and what your expectations are for instrumentation trends in the coming quarters?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i think -- yes, catherine, this is bob, all three of our businesses actually performed better in july than they did in may and june, which was very positive. the acg business actually led the charge in terms of that, as you would expect, given the resumption of activities. there's some catch up there, in terms of -- we saw that kind of phenomenon actually in china, in april. but ultimately acg was there.
i think, lsag capital is going to continue to be constrained. but i think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this in the past kind of this flight to quality. and with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, i think in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious. and we think our positioning is very good vis-a-vis the market.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i tried to hit that in my remarks, which as i really say, hey listen, we know we're picking up share in a tight market. and i think you saw that on c&e, right, which is if a c&e capital purchase is going down, it's coming agilent's way. and that's why -- and the overall market is still cautious, but you see pmi starting to creep up a bit. so yeah, catherine, just one last thing, to give you maybe a little more color. if we look across the groups, we would expect lsag to still be negative in q4. i mean, it's probably going to lag, given the [speech overlap] fourth quarter last year as well.
catherine ramsay -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. very helpful. and then, mike, you mentioned seeing growth in all regions for the non-covid diagnostics business exiting the quarter. can you just give us a sense of where those activity levels are in the us versus china and where they bottomed out across the different regions?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. so, i think, i'd say china is in lead position in terms of if you will, almost full recovery. europe is second and the us is trailing. so for the first -- throughout the quarter, if i look at sam's business in the us, for example, the first two months were negative and -- of diagnostic testing volumes in pathology. but we saw actually improvement to growth in july. so, i think that's sort of the pattern -- almost the pattern of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. china is back. europe is on its way. and i'd say, us is still in the early stages of recovery.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. and i would say, in the us it's probably -- and keep me honest, sam it's -- we're probably still at about 80% pre-covid levels from a diagnostics perspective, but improving where it was. it was below that at the beginning of the quarter, so. does that sound, sam?
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
it does.
catherine ramsay -- robert w. baird -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of steve willoughby with cleveland research. your line is open.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, [phonetic] steve.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research company -- analyst
a lot of my -- hi there mike. just one question for you. a lot of my other questions have already been answered. 90 days ago you made a brief comment about potential onshoring back in the us. just was wondering if there's any update on that at all? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. happy to comment on that. i think that's still going to happen. and these things take time. but, there's active discussion. and, by the way, i wouldn't say it's just confined in the united states. i mean, many geographies are now looking at the security of their supply chain, both in the pharma side as well as in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the apis for the pharma chains. so, there's nothing significant to announce relative to the impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend in this regard. and i can say also from an agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our supply chain is secure as well. so, i think that the covid-19 pandemic is a real wake up call to really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of supply chain. so, we're kind of working both sides of it, which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios, as well as we do see some market trends under way. bob, i know you've taken a look at this pretty [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. we would expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book. and that's probably more a '21 time frame for revenue. i wouldn't expect any of that to happen in q4, just given the kind of timing. but you're seeing it in multiple end markets in multiple regions. we think this is a trend that will continue.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research company -- analyst
thanks for that color. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of dan brennan with ubs. your line is open.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. hey, guys. hope you guys are doing well.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
mike and bob. sure. maybe first question just on chemical and energy, obviously, you've already highlighted a few comments throughout the call. but just wondering if you can kind of walk through a little more color separate trends within that segment by customer in chemical. i don't know if it's worth seeing if there's been a big divergence all between chemical and a&p and r&m? and then secondarily, maybe just remind us of how much of that business is tied toward like qa/qc versus r&d and kind of what are we looking for to determine whether or not this down 10% begins to improve more reliably, or if it's going to save the slow steady progress that you believe?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bob, why don't i make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if i missed anything. but, i think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- and i think both the chemical and the energy later side had about the same dynamics where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument side. and on one hand, the chemical side of the business was really benefiting -- continues benefit from the low oil prices. but, some of their end markets are weak, whether be automotive or some of the other markets that they service are weak. some of them are getting a little bit of help on covid-19 related products. but overall, i'd say both, the chemical side, as well as the energy side of that are down about the same, but stable. and i have to say that bob and i had talked to at some length about this in our last call. and our prediction at the time was we thought we were going to be in a kind of a stable situation relative to this. that wasn't going to get any worse. that was sort of the question we were getting last call. so, i think we're really pleased to see that that came through this quarter. and we expect that eventually this thing will start to move back to grow.
i think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it's in qa/qc. and that's why these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. so, qa/qc equipment will be needed as well as consumer services that go with it. so, they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long. there is an element of research. but i think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that is the qa/qc side of the business.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. and i think, mike -- the only thing i'd add, dan is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slow progress going forward.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then, maybe one different follow-up, i know -- a couple of questions on china. but maybe could you just go a little bit more into detail on what you saw in food and generics? obviously covid is impacting the globe and the recovery. but, you've got some pretty unique issues with food and generics that are maybe a little different. so, dependent upon the improvement or lack thereof, that could drive notable changes in china. so, what did you see there? and what's the outlook as we look forward to those two segments? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
do you want to take that one?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i was going to say, dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in china was all three of the business groups grew and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. it's been a while since we've been able to say that. and so, we think that -- we talked about kind of the moves away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs, and we think that that's stabilized, and team has really been able to garner share, or our view of capacity in that space.
and then, in pharma, it continues to perform very well. actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in china, and that's a combination of both, large and small molecule. and i think that our thesis around that continues to play out, which is that the winners of the 4% [phonetic] plus 7% [phonetic] or the tendering process are -- customers that where we are over indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from q2 to q3 in both, food and pharma, and the rest of the businesses were positive as well. so, i think, it's broad-based.
dan brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, quite welcome.

your next question comes from the line of patrick donnelly with citigroup. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, patrick.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
mike -- hey, mike. maybe just one for you on -- i know, there's been a few questions in july obviously. but with all the businesses returning to growth, i guess, is it safe to assume you guys didn't see too much of a pullback around the second wave here in the us, even the first few weeks of august? it sounds like you're a little more cautious on americas versus other geographies. but, just wondering, any surprises on an end market basis in the us, as you went through july and even early august, given the reoccurrence of virus?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, i'll jump in on this. but from our perspective, i don't know real surprises. maybe we're -- like all of us are watching what was happening with the pandemic as it worked its way across throughout the us and we saw the case numbers go up and lab access was down for the early really sharply april, may, june and we started seeing some recovery. so, i think no real surprises versus what we thought.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i would agree. i mean, patrick, this is bob. the americas, as mike said earlier, is in fact the biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both europe and china. and i think, the thing that we're watching is those covid flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which would impact our diagnostics business. that's probably got the biggest variability going into q4 relative to lsag and acg. but, to mike's point, we did not see any significant change with these flare-ups in august -- or excuse me in july and early august.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. no, that's helpful. and then a bunch of that good commentary on the chemical and energy and industrial side. just want to, i guess clarify, i mean it certainly seems like the industrial sentiment feels like it might have bottomed. it seems like your tone is little bit better from three months ago. even though, again, chemical and energy is probably going to be down similar this quarter and again next quarter. but, i guess what you're hearing from customers there on spend plans? again, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic and talking a little more bullishly about '21. so, i'm just wondering, i guess, as we enter into the end of this fiscal year into '21, are you seeing things improve a little bit? obviously, you'll come up against very easy comps, but it does seem like the tone is a little more positive. so, are you hearing from customers, things that are trending a little bit better into '21?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think that's a fair assessment of what i was trying to communicate today. first of all, the fact that we do think it's bottomed. and that was our thesis when the things started going directly down and the pandemic hit. so, we do see that. again, i don't want to get too far ahead and describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. but, customers are working on the plans. chevron actually is making some big investments in iraq. so capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the highest capability. so, we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. i think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling more clarity in their view of where the economy is going, then they can make their decisions with a lot more confidence. so, the pmis are a good view of how sentiment may be changing. so, again, don't over interpret this for fourth quarter, but it does point to '21 being perhaps a better environment.

hey, jack.

hey, jack.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
so, i wanted to go back to the nasd business and just get a little bit more color. are you working on any of the mrna-based covid-19 vaccine? i guess, curious because the trials are going so quickly. i was curious to get your take if one [indecipherable] and into commercial within the next six months, how would you manage the business to deliver on the capacity that customer might need for that?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, sam, i'm going to pass that to you.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. no problem, mike. so, i can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecule of the projects that we're doing related to covid-19. but, two things i will point out. as bob indicated earlier, this is business separate for or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business, if you will. and we believe, we have the capacity and that's -- if the demand is there related to certain things playing out related to covid-19 and the molecule that we happen to be working on, we believe we will be in a position to be able to supply that material as the volume required.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
great. and then, one more follow-up on lsag. i'm just curious, as you're looking at the research labs around the globe, kind of in this conversation around deferral versus cancellation, what are customers telling you? is it still mostly deferrals versus cancellations? and on the deferral side, when do you expect these, how far out is it getting pushed something that you think it hits before the end of the year or probably more likely in calendar '21?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey jack. happy to answer this question. this is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals versus cancellations. and we've really been pleased, our cancellations are actually lower than last year. and our thesis is they're being pushed and actually funds will be deployed this calendar year.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. that's what we actually -- we saw that -- jack, some of that actually happen in q3. and as people are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. but to mike's point, we've seen no cancellation -- or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. there's always some level of it. i would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased. and i would expect it to happen this calendar year.

good afternoon and welcome to the agilent technologies third quarter earnings conference call. all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] thank you.
and now i'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, ankur dhingra, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, robert, and welcome everyone to agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. i hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

and now i would like to turn the call over to mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. the agilent team delivered excellent results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. against this backdrop, agilent's performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business.
agilent's q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis, despite covid-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. on a core basis, revenues are down 3%. these results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business over the past several years.
eps was $0.78 per share. this is a 3% year-over-year increase. operating margin improved 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. our q3 results are further evidence of the success of our profitable build-and-buy growth strategy. we continue to build a more resilient growth-oriented business.
last quarter i talked to you about the four key priorities we're focused on during the covid-19 pandemic, protecting our people, being open for business for our customers, taking decisive actions to preserve our p&l and balance sheet, and an unwavering commitment to growth. staying focused on these priorities has helped us navigate through the covid-19 effects on our team, customers and business. our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and our enhanced digital capabilities. in fact, q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs.
in all regions, we're seeing improvements in lab access for our customers and increased non-covid-19 testing volumes. there are, however, regional and end market differences in the pacing of improvement. lab access improved through the quarter, although still not at pre-covid-19 levels. globally lab access remained limited in academia, non-covid-19 research and testing labs. we're also seeing continued limited access to some private sector research labs in europe and the united states.
similarly, non-covid-19 diagnostic testing volumes improved throughout the quarter, but remained down from prior-year levels. hospital access in europe and the us is improving, although disrupted at times by virus flare-ups. while there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe, caution remains in customer capital expenditure decisions. consistent with our thinking coming into the quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. as expected, china led the way for us and exceeded our expectations with revenues up 11%. china's growth in the quarter is broad based across all end markets and for all business groups.
while improving, the rate of recovery in europe and the americas lags china given the timing when these regions first felt the brunt of the pandemic. european revenues are down 5%. americas market conditions trailed both china and europe with revenues declining 10%. however, as we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic testing volumes. on a total company basis, we exited july with modest growth across all major markets.
now let's talk about our performance by business groups. our life sciences and applied markets group grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. our team is focused and determined to gain market share despite a constrained capital environment. the strength of our portfolio, coupled with an energized and stable sales team is paying dividends. i'm also very proud of the contributions our cell analysis technologies are making in covid-19 virus research. our m&a strategy is working and making a difference in the pandemic fight.
our crosslab group revenues grew 1%. increase in customer activity led to increased sales of consumables and an uptake of on-demand services. the crosslab team continues to win large multi-year contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. we are continually increasing our competitiveness in this space.
our diagnostics and genomics group revenues declined 8%. while our overall pathology and genomics businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and non-covid-19 lab openings. partially offsetting this, our nucleic acid solutions business delivered another strong quarter growing almost 25%. we are very excited about the future of our nasd business.
as we announced earlier today, we plan to more than double oligo manufacturing capacity at our new frederick, colorado site. this expansion helps us meet significantly increasing customer demand. we are growing double digit and expect to continue this rate of growth in the coming years.
we continue to invest in our portfolio across all our businesses. highlights during the quarter include lsag launching two new lc/ms products, the agilent 6470b triple quad and the agilent rapidfire 400 systems. both products are aimed at high-throughput labs driving productivity and superior resolution. we launched our crosslab asset monitoring service, which is a new subscription service, using instrument technologies to provide data-driven usage insights. this helps drive improved customer economics and lab productivity. while early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service.
during the quarter, our pd-l1 assay was approved by the fda for expanded use in non-small cell lung cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies.
our team is very proud of the role their company is playing in the global covid-19 fight. we are supporting covid-19 research, testing and therapeutic and vaccine development. our efforts in the global fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. we are accelerating efforts to make a difference in the battle against covid-19 and have mobilized a cross agilent team to maximize customer support.
let me close with a few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. while there is still significant uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the july trend of gradual improvement in our business to continue into q4. by region, china will continue to be a positive story for us and lead the return to growth. europe is starting to trend upward. the americas are also expected to improve, but at a lower rate than china and europe. globally, improved lab access, increasing non-covid 19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy are all positive signs. i remain absolutely convinced agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a stronger position in the marketplace.
our continued focused action on our four priorities, protect the team, support our customers, preserve our p&l and balance sheet and our unwavering investment in growth are delivering.
entering q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. yes, this pandemic remains unpredictable. however, i am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and return to growth.
before i hand the call over to bob, i'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. thanks for being on the call. i look forward to taking your questions after bob's remarks. and now, bob, over to you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, mike, and good afternoon everyone. today, i will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then i'll finish up with a framework for thinking about q4. as with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns. so we're not going to provide formal forward-looking guidance today. however, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing out in q4. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
as mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. on a core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter. currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage points while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth.
as mike talked about the regional performance, i'll speak to the end-market performance. in terms of our end markets, pharma grew 2% in q3, against the very strong comparison of 13% from last year. both small and large molecule applications grew and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug development labs increased production and access. we experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical as anticipated. revenues declined 10% primarily due to conditions in the us driven by covid-19 related disruptions to patient visits and diagnostic labs opportunities. encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine testing throughout the quarter, especially in china and europe while the us lagged.
chemical and energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. revenues were generally flat sequentially with conditions largely similar to what we saw in q2. as we've talked about previously, we expect this segment to ramp more slowly than others.
the food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. we are seeing ongoing signals that the market in china has stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. the food market was just one of several bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in china, including growth in the low teens for our pharma business.
our environmental and forensics business declined mid-single digits against a double-digit compare. and the academic and government segment declined mid-single digits while improving on a sequential basis in q3. strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closures.
now let's turn to the rest of the p&l. i'm extremely proud of how the agilent team has responded to the challenging environment. during the quarter we continued our focus on managing expenses, while ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. these expense management actions we initiated last quarter were on full display in q3. in addition, our customer engagement model using digital tools continued to gain traction, while also delivering savings in sg&a.
as a result, operating margins of 23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenue. gross margin, at 55.1%, was down 130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix and higher logistics costs. however, strong cost management in operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. this combination of factors resulted in non-gaap eps for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the number we posted a year ago.
now from a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. in terms of capital spending, we spent $25 million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in q2. we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash.
also during the quarter, we took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short term debt with a 10-year bond with a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio. as you know, we paused share buybacks in q2 pending improvement in business conditions. in q3, our visibility into business trends and cash flow improved and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases late in the quarter.
in the quarter in total, we repurchased 360,000 shares for $33 million. going forward, we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases along with additional opportunistic buying. our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on growth m&a opportunities, while also returning cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
as we look to q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of this pandemic. however, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter.
we generally expect the trajectory of gradual improvement in business results to continue across all regions. areas where we see a broader range of scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets, non-covid diagnostic testing, especially in the us, and the general capex environment. a combination of these factors could result in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth. also as a reminder, the biotek acquisition closed mid-way through q4 of last year, so the m&a impact in q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point of growth and currency is forecasted to be positive in the quarter.
the low end of this range envisions covid-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall in various geographies, limiting and in some cases, reversing the recovery gains we have seen in the period of time. in this scenario one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia and other markets as continued tight cash-management leading to lower capex spending in the us and europe. we hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know we have plans in place in case this happens.
the higher end of the range assumes the continued recovery by region building on what we have seen in july, with the biggest impact coming from the us. this would include a continual increase in elective medical procedures, such as cancer screenings as well as continued lab openings. this view would include continued china momentum, along with the continued improvement in europe and other areas in the americas. again, this is not guidance, but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for q4.
overall, i feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery.
and with that, i will turn over things to ankur to direct the q&a. ankur?
ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations

certainly. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of vijay kumar with evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on the blueprints here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vijay.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
a couple of questions from me, mike, maybe on -- first on the guidance part here. i guess, the q1 guidance of 4.5% to 5.5% core, does it have -- does it assume any co-tailwinds, because, i guess, if you look at q4, i mean 6% core, any reason why the core should slow down sequentially?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me start, before bob. so again, thanks for the earlier comments, vijay. so how we characterize our q1 guide is positive, but we use a very prudent approach, and that -- we got a lot of confidence in terms of reinstating the guidance, and we had very good momentum in q4. and when we look at the backlog, we feel very confident about reinstating guidance. but the virus is still out there, and we still think there is still a higher level of uncertainty to call for a prudent approach. hence it's positive, but prudent approach. if it turns out better, we'd be -- we'd love to be in a position to be able to raise our outlook for the year, but we thought for the first guide for the year including q1, we should take a positive and prudent approach, plus recognizing the virus is still out there.
bod, do you want to add anything to that?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, vijay. i think a couple of things. the thing that i would say is, we didn't end the year with emptying the tank out and feel really good about that, but that being said, we do have some business that is somewhat susceptible to some of these areas. and so, we probably have greater visibility or variability in some of our diagnostics businesses. so we -- as mike said, we're taking kind of a prudent approach there.
and the other area is, we wanted to see more than just one quarter in the chemical and energy business. i think that's one of the areas where i think -- we think we're biased to the upside in the way we're kind of thinking about the business, but it's certainly with the recovery. we do expect some covid tailwinds to your point. it's probably on the order of roughly about 1.5 points to 2 points, kind of consistent with what we've seen in the last several quarters. so that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, bob. and mike, one bigger picture question for you. i think you mentioned nasd was up 40% in the quarter. did that business accelerate nasd? and i'm curious the longer-term opportunity here when you think about it, how -- can this be -- can this end up being a $0.5 billion product for agilent as you look at four, five years out? i'm curious on your thoughts. and bob, i think you mentioned the 50 basis points to 70 basis points of margin expansion inclusive of investments in frederick facility. what do you think was the impact was of those investments on the margins, or i guess what i'm asking is what should margin expansion have been without those investments? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, bob. thanks for the questions, vijay. i'll take the first part and then you can take the second part. so that's not out of the realm of reason. your first question in terms of the longer-term potential total revenue for agilent. we kind of put a teaser out there earlier about our december analyst and investor day. so we'll talk a bit more about nasd when we meet, but as you know, we are really pleased with -- we've talked about in past in terms of getting to that exit rate of over $200 million business. and while our capacity in terms of physical capacity is built, we're now in the phase of the first year of operation, so we're -- just like we did with our bolder side, we will continue to find ways to drive more productivity and efficiency out of that asset.
and we just announced another expansion of another production line within that existing facility. so i hope what you're hearing is a very bullish tone both in terms of the market growth, but also our ability to get our -- more of our unfair share, if you will, to capture share in a growing market.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, vijay. this is bob, just to build on that what mike talked about. the beauty of that businesses continued to accelerate throughout the year in that 40% -- that roughly 40% growth in q4 was the highest. it was all year. and we -- that team has done just a fantastic job of scaling that business, and we're not done. and as mike said, we're making incremental investments in building out that capacity, which will continue to make throughout the course of next year. that is probably about a 20 basis point headwind next year in the operating margin. just rough numbers there, vijay. but extremely pleased with the work that that team has been able to do and continuing to drive that growth, and so, we feel very good about that business.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of puneet souda with svb leerink. your line is open.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
yeah. hi, bob and mike. thanks for taking the question. so bob, actually -- and one of the question on guidance, and this is probably a favorite topic for you, the chinese lunar new year. [speech overlap] that time of the year. so this time, obviously -- you obviously -- you are seeing how the troops are acting on the ground, how things are there and i would suspect it would be a lesser impact to this year, lesser travel, but correct me if i'm wrong on that, and then in light of that, i mean, the guidance that again appears conservative. is there anything that we ought to keep in mind for a market that is growing double-digit for you already and is a sizable portion of your revenue? so just walk us through how are you thinking about the lunar new year impact here?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's great puneet. as you accurately state our expectation is the impacts going to be much less this year than it was last year for all the things that you just talked about less travel, timing of when it is and so forth, relative to the q1. and what we're seeing is actually very strong, continued recovery and performance in our china business, and i would say that there is -- q1 is no different. and so the story there certainly remains intact, and i would expect it to be very strong performance in q1. i think what we're trying to do is, there is nothing in particular, but i think we're just probably taking a little more prudent approach in europe, and as we're seeing some of the shutdowns, particularly in some of these areas.
and i think, as we look at where are the things that could potentially be upsides or downsides, i think that continued recovery in chemical and energy across the business also continued performance. in americas, we're expecting kind of an average budget flush, so to speak. that's another question that's probably if people are thinking about by for the end of the year. and both of those things could be better than expected.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob, i could just jump in on that just to amplify the point puneet that bob made. we're very, very happy with our china business, and we exited the year with momentum and that's carrying forward into 2021. we're positioning ourselves with a wait and see moment on c&e, and that could be a source of upside for the year, and like i said earlier, we're fully prepared to reflect that in our revised outlook. and i would just use the word maybe prudent as a way to describe as the additive bob and i have been using to describe our guide.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
okay. that's -- no, that's very helpful. thanks. and if i could get a sense on the cell analysis business, that business continues to be really strong for you. biotek [indecipherable] other products in that product line. just wanted to get a sense of what are some of the key drivers there? is it largely the cell and gene therapy, the cellular product and drug product market? or is there something in the academic end that is driving that growth or especially in china? we would appreciate and helping frame what's exactly happening then the opportunity there longer term?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, puneet. thanks for the question. and as i mentioned in my call script, we're really pleased with how we've been able to integrate the biotek team, make them part of the agilent family, and then how that collected has led to have us have a very healthy cell analysis just north of $300 million, growing nicely for us.
and i know that jacob would love to talk a little more about the cell analysis. so jacob, your thoughts on the specific questions that puneet put forward.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president and president, life sciences and applied markets group
so first of all let me just echo that i think it's a very impressive what the team has been doing in the past year, and the growth actually stems [phonetic] from many multiple dimensions here. first of all, we have seen -- first of all, with the testing that a lot of our biotek portfolio has been using for that for the elisa testing. and -- but we also see, generally speaking, imaging being very relevant in the academic markets, but also in the biopharma markets. and the cs [phonetic] portfolio was with the flow. cytometry is also seeing quite a lot of interest. so it's really broad across both academic and biopharma and covid related that we see interest.
live cell analysis was where we put out a few years ago that this was an area that would be -- continue to see a lot of growth, particularly at that time about immuno-oncology. but clearly that has moved into our broad understanding on the immune system. right now, covid part, generally speaking, i think this will be a focus for many years to come. so very pleased, and we continued to expect good growth in that business.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, puneet, just one thing because you mentioned china, and we see really china as a huge opportunity for us going forward. the real growth has been primarily in the u.s, and europe, i mean it's growing in china as well, but it's off a very small basis. so when we think about the opportunities going forward, leveraging the large infrastructure that agilent has is really a big opportunity for us for many years to come in the cell analysis space.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
great. okay. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jp morgan. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, tycho.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
mike, i'm wondering if you could talk a little more on the biopharma strength. 12% on a 7% comp is obviously phenomenal. i know you had 2% from nasd and you just talked about cell analysis, but can you maybe just talk more broadly on the strength in biopharma? was any of this a catch-up from slower spending in the first half of the year, and how do you think about the sustainability of the demand? i know you mentioned -- you're thinking about an average budget flush, but can you just talk to the broader strength in biopharma?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. happy to do so, tycho, and without giving away too many of the tip, i want to talk about more -- in more depth in a few weeks. there was no catch up here. this is part of this continued strength in the biopharma area. it's been an area of focus, and we'll go into some more detail with you in a few weeks, but it's been an area of focus in terms of increased investments relative to our biopharma tools, both the interpretation along with the chemistry platform, real workflow focus there, console value chain. we're getting nice growth as you mentioned earlier nasd, but that's -- the story is much bigger than that to be honest with you. and then, obviously we're picking up some growth here in the cell analysis.
i think it's been a -- it's really a multifaceted strategy that's really driving this growth. we think it's sustainable. we think that double-digit outlook on the biopharma portion of agilent business is quite reasonable. we're really excited it's an investment priority for us.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, and tycho, maybe if i can add to mike's point in terms of -- because it's not only the platforms in the portfolio that we have on the interim patients which we've been making some heavy investments in it. but it has also been the informatics in the software piece, which has allowed us to be able to kind of plug into the labs, the analytical labs and then you bring in the acg services portfolio to help them manage the labs, and particularly, with everything that's going on right now the last thing they want is their scientists to be managing the instrumentation. they want them to be doing the science. and so, we think we've got a very compelling software and tools offering, and i think it's showing up in the marketplace across multiple technology platforms.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
great. and then mike, you used the phrase wait and see moment for c&e a couple of minutes ago, and it's good to see that back to growth. can you maybe just talk on some of the data points you're watching in your customer base, and how you're thinking about the recovery curve there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, tycho. so my comments come back from my first year as ceo, when i tried to call the turn of the c&e business. and eventually a term, i think, i was off by several quarters. so i learned my lesson, so to speak. so as bob mentioned, one quarter trend is not make, but we're very encouraged by that because it's the first time we've seen some growth after those two double-digit declines earlier this year.
and we look at a couple of things, tycho. one is beyond just the pmis and the positive moves in the pmis are indicative of improved end-market strength, particularly in c&e. we also look at the -- will be estimate to be the age of the installed base, because there's a lot of aged equipment out there, and that has been probably at a very high levels, and then we look at the deal flow. so kind of all those factors -- the macro outlook from pmis what we know to be the current environment for customers in terms of their age of their installed base, and then also what we're seeing in our funnels.
and agilent has a real strength in its markets. i think, we will benefit from a returned year to the growth. and again we weren't ready yet to put it in the numbers for q1 and the full year, but we're hopeful that that trend will continue. there are some indications that it could. but let's give them another quarter or so.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, before i hop off, one quick one on china. one of the tools companies, mettler, talked about pent-up demand and kind of suggested that what they saw may not be sustainable. have you seen anything in your order book that would suggest what you're seeing in china now is not [speech overlap]?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, tycho, really appreciate you for asking that question, because not at all -- i mean, this has been a continuous steady flow of business. we think the end-markets are really strong here. we see a lot of strength in china government funding to make sure they stimulate the economy. and then, we've talked earlier about just overall their investments in improving the quality of life. if you notice the strong growth in the food market, continued strength in pharma. so -- no, we've seen this -- but i think if you really look closely at the pacing and it's all nothing unusual.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, tycho. i think, we've been extraordinarily pleased with the way our china business has performed throughout the course of this year. and when you think about kind of our cadence through q1, q2, q3 and q4, we've seen accelerated growth. so we saw our lowest growth in the first quarter, where we saw the impact of covid-19, but then what we've seen is improvements as opposed to this real -- huge increase and then kind of a drop off. so we're not expecting any drop-off, and we haven't seen that in our order book or any of the conversations that we've had with our customers that there were sort of a material catch.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
you're quite welcome, tycho.

your next question comes from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies. your line is open.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
hey, thanks. good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, brandon.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
mike, a couple of questions on lsag.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
curious if you could speak to the order book in the fourth quarter and to the extent that you may have built some backlogs there? and curious as to we think that perhaps the margin compression in the fourth quarter, but that was mostly mix or [indecipherable] dynamics there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
happy to do so, brandon. so one of the reasons why we were able to reinstate guidance this year was what we saw in the lsag order book. and as you know, we stopped two years ago talking about specifics on orders, but i think in today's call, it's really prudent to just to give you a sense of why bob and i have this confidence around the outlook. so we didn't gasp as we went across the finish line. for 2020, order book was strong in lsag and continued in -- has continued into the early few weeks of this year. so again, all the other caveats aside being prudent and recognition of the virus.
we feel pretty good about our ability to reinstate guideline because as we mentioned earlier, reinstate guide -- as mentioned earlier, lsag was one where we hit the most early in the year. and i think we're feeling pretty good about that. and bob, as i recall, most of the gross margin is really just a mix of the various instrument platforms.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's right. i mean, i think brandon to really what mike was saying, i mean, we feel very good. orders exceeded revenue and exceeded our expectations, and so it was a bit of a mix shift that is impacting that, and -- but we would expect that to kind of normalize out throughout the course of next year. and so we feel very good about kind of where that business is going into 2021.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. brandon, just one additional thought here, which is we've seen no real changes in the pricing environment. so that's why we can say pretty common [phonetic] that they have to be the mix of product this quarter.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
super. and one more for bob. you mentioned currency was a drag to margins in the fourth quarter. could you quantify that -- the magnitude of the operating line and then what you penciled in for impact of fx to operating margins in 2021 and beyond?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it was roughly about 40-ish 45-ish on the cogs line, and some of that was offset through the bottom line. and for next year, less impact -- much less impactful than that, probably, less about 10 points -- 10 basis points.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
super thanks.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
your welcome.
brandon couillard -- jefferies & company -- analyst
your next question comes from the line of dan leonard with wells fargo. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so to start off on the guidance. the question for probably you, bob, you touched on this in pieces, but can you give us at a high level what your key assumptions are by region and by end-market?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so by -- at the highest level, we are expecting steady improvement throughout the course of the year from the standpoint of the economic perspective. if i think about it from a geography first, china is going to lead the way with high-single-digit growth, continuing the momentum that we've seen. we ended this year fy20 about 7%, and we're expecting that or better into next year. and then what you would see is a recovery in the americas, getting back to kind of mid-to-high single digits and then followed by europe, which would be kind of the low-to-mid single digits.
so that's kind of on an end-market perspective how we would think about it. it's predicated on that continued recovery and that we would, as i mentioned before, not have any extended periods of shut down that would disrupt business. i think the good thing is what we're seeing, not only ourselves, but our customers are being able to operate in a different environment than they had the first time these were shut down. so we're not expecting any material impact there.
and from an end-market perspective, the strength is really going to be the continued strength that we've seen in the last several years, really driven behind our pharma business, which is probably high-single digits, with biopharma as one of the earlier questions came out, probably growing double digits going forward. and then food, we'll probably expect maybe a little bit tempering. it would be great to have 16% every quarter, but we're not ready to put that into our plan. but i would expect continued recovery there, probably in the mid-single digits and also recovery in our diagnostics and clinical business, particularly in that same kind of mid-single digits and probably ramping throughout the course of the year.
and probably more muted on the academia and government, probably flattish to low. and as we talked about before, chemical and energy flattish, so that's really one where we're hoping that we're biased, and there is more upside than downside here. but certainly given the momentum, but one quarter is too early to put forecast on there, and so we're assuming roughly flat and then probably a recovery in the environmental and forensic market at low-single digits.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thanks for that overview. and next for my follow-up, you touched on there being a wider range of outcomes in 2021 in typical, and mentioned that the bottom end doesn't capture any threats around reestablishment of lockdowns or whatnot. do you feel the high end of guidance really captures all the benefits from easy comparison? is there any potential upside there might be, or how would you frame what you're capturing in the high-end there?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would say it's continued momentum, but i think that there is probably more upsides than downsides in the way that we're trying to capture that. certainly exiting at a 6% growth rate, there are -- we're -- probably the biggest areas are around chemical and energy and the pace of recovery in academia and government. and if those continue, i would say -- let me put it this way, if chemical and energy continue at 3% and growing, we'll be that number.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely. thank you.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.

your next question comes from the line at douglas schenkel with cowen. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, doug.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
maybe, i have a few clean up guidance questions. but before i get to that one, i just wanted to talk about your performance, specific to your mass spec product line. you talked about another quarter of double-digit growth. i'm just wondering if you'd be willing to unpack that a bit more and just talk about what's driving this? and specifically, is china and more specifically china food a major driver? i guess, i'm just trying to get at which segments of the portfolio or specific end-markets or geographies that really stand out within a pretty robust and impressive growth rate there.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug. really appreciate the opportunity to have jacob comment more deeply on that, but as you know, i highlighted that in my script, we'll able to call out that double-digit growth. we're extremely proud of that.
and, jacob, i think you've got some additional insight that you could share with doug?
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president and president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely. it's great question, and i am certainly proud of what the team has been doing over the past year, because this is not only a quarter -- quarterly effect here. but we do have done a quite an overhaul of mass spec portfolio, particularly the lcms portfolio over the last few years, both on the high end, third quarter also in the second quarter. and you've seen we have really been focused on robust, reliable and routine applications. and this is really what the customer is looking for right now.
so you can you can really see that the investments we have done really resonates with our customer base, and it's -- right now, i would say in most geographies and in most end-markets, but if you look into it, biopharma and china is definitely a big part of this story. and the other [indecipherable] is that we pivoted very quickly to remote customer engagement during this -- beginning of this year, and when the customer has to shutdown the laboratories, we will be there for them. we did support them when they had tough times, and you can see that paid dividends today that they also continued with the partnership with agilent. so i actually believe that we are in a quite good momentum here with the mass spec business.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
does that help, doug?
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
alright -- yeah, that sort of does. thank you for that. and then maybe just a few guidance questions. this will be kind of a speed round in a way because you have got some questions about this already. but on china, do you expect double-digit growth in fiscal 2021? on gross margin, you talked about some of the headwinds you saw in q4 becoming less pronounced moving forward. so do you expect gross margin overall to get back up to 56-plus level?
and then on covid-19, i think you talked about just over 2 points of covid tailwinds in the quarter. i'm just wondering if looking forward, either fiscal q1 or for the full year, if you could see a scenario where this would accelerate over time, if serology volumes begin to inflect in a positive way, and same thing on the antibody business, could those in combination drive more of a tailwind moving forward? so china, gross margin and covid-19.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so china high-single digits, maybe, low-double digits based on the range that we gave you. in terms of covid, what i would say is, we are expecting less incremental to growth, but certainly the things that you talked about are baked into our guidance. so more serology or antigen based testing or even vaccine-driven volume is not fully baked into the numbers that we have. it's just too early to tell, but those are certainly the things that are potential upsides.
and then the last one, i know -- which was your second question around gross margin. i would expect it to stabilize and not see the same level of decline. now, what i would say is, you will have some mix shift right, because our acg business which is lower gross margin than the instrument business but much higher operating margin helps us with that. so you do see a dampening effect on the gross margin side, but you will more than make up for it on the operating margin side. so...
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob -- doug, specifically to covid-19, we'll hit a little bit more of that when we have our analyst day. but we are planning to launch in early 2021 our serology test, and there are some things that we're working on that aren't baked into the guidance. we'll see how they play out.
doug schenkel -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. that's great. thank you guys for all the time and happy thanksgiving everybody.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
same to you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of derik de bruin if bank of america. your line is open.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. so, i'm going to do the similar to doug. i've got a couple of focused questions. i've got one guidance cleanup. so i guess, specifically, bob, you mentioned some software pushes in your business between the pharma business. can you be a little bit more specific on that? i mean, is openlab taking share against some power, new winning could you replaced in power and some of the accounts there? i'm just sort of curious, on what the dynamics are in the cds market?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. what i would say, doug -- excuse me, derik, is that we feel very good about our competitive positioning with openlab and the rest of our products.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. i'll leave with that, i guess. yeah. and by the way, i'm better looking than doug. the -- on the core genomics business, i mean, we don't really have talked about that, i mean, you talked about the nasd and some of these other things here. but what's going on your core genomics business? you've got sureselect, i mean, you've had some pressures in some of that end-market there. what's that underlying business growing?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. actually a great question, because we didn't highlight that, but actually when you look at sequential performance that was one of the things that was very positive in the dgg business. it recovered very nicely into q4.
and maybe i'll let sam talk about some of the details there.
sam raha -- senior vice president and president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah, sure. thanks, bob. as you said, we -- as we went into the heavy part of the pandemic, if you will, late q2, early q3, some of the genomics business also serves clinical diagnostic customers be it for sureselect being the backbone in some of the leading cancer diagnostic and u.s.-based [phonetic] tests, as well as other inherited diseases.
so we definitely saw the effect of that, but coming into q4 we've seen a steady stream of increase there. and we've also saw -- seen a positive effect in parts of our portfolio that are related to qpcr, be it our instruments, be it our consumables that are used. and also we have the leading genomics qc portfolio as you're probably aware of, and we see a number of those products, including our fragment analyzer being used increasingly for picking up conventional -- or sorry, with the pickup of conventional clinical testing, but also being used for example for some of the mrna vaccines that are in development. so all in all, the trend is looking encouraging for our core genomics business.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and then just one housekeeping question. for 2021, the other income expense line, how should we think about that for 2021?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob, do you want me handle that or you want to...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it will be slightly better than where it is this year.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jack meehan with nephron research. your line is open.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hello, jack.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
thanks. hey. good afternoon. let me to go back to biopharma. mike, i was curious if you're seeing any change in terms of customer spending patterns at all. because of covid-19, there's just been such a focus on bioprocessing to support vaccines and therapeutics. what's that doing in small molecule, if you can call out any trends?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
jack, great questions. so to our delight, it really hasn't seen cause any kind of material shift. and we were assuming -- in fact, i think bob had in his script where we saw strength across small molecule and a large molecule. now the small molecule is not growing as fast as large molecule is growing.
and bob, i -- i know [speech overlap].
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. jack, going to give you some numbers. i mean, for q4 small molecule grew high-single digits and for the year, it grew low-single digits. so despite all the hoopla, small molecule is not dead.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
great. and maybe just to build on that. so the high-teens acg growth in china, could you just parse out for us, how did food do versus how did, maybe, generics do in terms of some of the [phonetic] consolidation there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
as far as i recall, and i'd like padraig [indecipherable] i think it was broad-based across all end-markets. everything was in that double-digit range.
and padraig, anything you'd add to that?
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president president, agilent crosslab group
no. i think you said it well, mike. i think across both sides of the business, both the consumables and services had very strong demand in all markets, and we see certainly a strong demand for our installation for mineralization and start-up services. so -- and really strong across the board in china.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of patrick donnelly with citi. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, patrick.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
maybe to follow up on the -- just on the chemical and energy side, it certainly sounds like that's the biggest area of upside, maybe the biggest variable for next year. it sounds like chemical and material things are improving, can you just us give a bit more detail around the customer tone there? and then, is energy the bigger variable to 2021, and just talk through kind of the scenario analysis as you guys think about it? certainly, it seems like there is upside, but maybe just kind of what parts of the business you feel like are the biggest variable there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think that -- just sort of all the kind of this [phonetic] always helpful reminder, but in a kind of our mix. so it's 70/30. 70/30 in chemicals and materials, and 30% energy. actually the upside is on the chemicals and material. we -- energy lags, and we aren't really seeing a lot of indications of why that would pick up.
but you have to remember some of the chemical companies are actually providing products and such into end-markets that support covid-19. they're feeling, what drives this marketplace? yes, we talked a lot about pmis, but really all the pmis are really related to the view of global growth. and i think that customer base is feeling more confident about where the economy is going and think this -- this shut really slowed down earlier this year just for a must kind of purchases, but i think it's improved view of the overall economic outlook for the chemical and materials side plus the fact that they have some kind of covid-19 tailwind to help them out.
i wouldn't say that the entire story is just the element of it. i think the biggest part here is just the fact that there's much more common in the customer base about the growth environment from an economic standpoint.
bob, anything you would add to that?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. i don't.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and then maybe just on a capital deployment side. you guys always take the balanced approach, and i'm sure we'll hear more about it in a couple of weeks, but how are things trending in the pipeline on the m&a side? your cash flow has obviously been pretty strong. how active should we expect you guys to be on that front? any changes and thoughts around the size of deals you want to pursue, and any metrics you can throw out there would be helpful? thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no, we continue to be very interested in deploying capital for growth standpoint along all the dimensions we talked about earlier. we said that the biotek size deal, which we were really quite happy with, that was largest deal we've done to-date. that doesn't mean that would be the largest deal we would do. we've always said, i think [indecipherable] was not magnitudes of delta, and although, we didn't closed any deals this year, i think that really was somewhat tied into some of the covid-19 challenges of doing due diligence and working with potential targets, but we still see this as a key part of our, what we call, our build and buy growth strategy, and think that m&a can be a nice adder to our core growth businesses.
so you guessed right, so we'll talk more about it in a few weeks, but we still have our aspirations in the space. but really sticking to the model, the framework that we've been using before, which is m&a in markets that are higher growth investor company that aligns strategically with us where we can -- where they can benefit by our scale and are accretive to the p&l.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i would say, patrick, just to build on what mike was saying. i mean, we feel very good about the acquisitions that we made, the two -- the last two, which was biotek and acea were probably the fastest growing parts of our business, if you take out nasd. and so, i think it validates the space that we're looking at, and we don't see a reason to need to change our m&a framework.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. thanks, guys.
operator
your final question comes from the line of steve beuchaw with wolfe research. your line is open.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe -- analyst
hi. thanks for sneaking me in here. i'll just ask one, maybe i guess it's a two-parter; one part for mike, one part for bob, and...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
okay. hope you'd be giving easy one.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe -- analyst
i think you're going to like it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
okay.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe -- analyst
mike, so last call, you raised this concept, you called it a flight to quality, and you talked about how the team with the execution has been able to drive share gains. i wonder if you could talk about whether you think that as the pandemic subsided in some ways and labs are opening up again, if you think that dynamic has become any more or less acute, and if you think it's sticky, i'm going to go ahead and ask the second part of my, i guess, i'll call it covid discovery question for bob. bob, like a lot of cfos, you've had a chance to see how much you can save within operating expenses, as we're all working remotely and being more digital. have you thought about putting any numbers around how much of the savings that you've discovered here could end up being permanent? thanks a bunch, everybody.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. thanks, steve. so, in regards to the first one, we probably talked about the flight to quality when money is tight, but we also, i think, tied it to stability, and how we protected our overall field team and our ability to support our customers during the pandemic. so i think those two things are going to carry us forward. so we think that the stickiness will remain there, and i don't think that the quality will fall out of fashion, and i think as you continue to grow your position in the installed base, this gives you an upper hand in terms of next buy when they get around to making the next capital purchasing decision.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i would agree with that, mike, and i think that -- i think two things, one is, we were there when the customers needed us the most, and our team, particularly, in the field, helping support critical operations and so forth, and that flight to quality on the instrumentation side only pays dividends going forward. so i think there is no -- there will be no follow up there. i truly believe that.
on the cost side, we're still working through some of those things, a big thing, probably the biggest variable here, and it's got a couple of different tentacles to it would be around travel, and i think we had talked about before. at one point in time, we're spending roughly $10 million a month in travel, and that is down, i would say, substantially, and our goal is that that will be back to $10 million a month, and so, that doesn't say that we're going to necessarily drop it all to the bottom line, but reinvest in some areas that will drive growth going forward, but certainly those, and then there will be more efficient ways of doing things like marketing outreach to our customers, and even operating, one of the things is we still operated and launched new products, despite not having been in the labs for the most part for nine months out of the year. and so, our teams are finding innovative ways to continue to actually move things around without having to spend incremental dollars. so more to come on that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we think some things are going to stick. particularly, as it relates to your digital engagement with customers, because there's a huge element of being responsive, and we think that digital cable is a big part of that story, and yes, it has been accelerated by covid, but we don't think there's any going back either.
steve beuchaw -- wolfe -- analyst
got it. thank you for all the color there, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're quite welcome.

and now, i would like to turn the call over to mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. today, i want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story.
the agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020. we posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter. revenues are up 8% on a reported basis and up 6% core. operating margins are a healthy 24.9%. eps of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year. these numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that is built for continued growth. our better-than-expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end-markets.
geographically, china continues to lead the way with double-digit growth. from an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits. in addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations. we also saw a rebound in u.s. sales during the quarter. overall, covid-19 tailwinds contributed just over 2 points of core growth.
achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years. i couldn't be more pleased with the way the agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020. we have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way.
during the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high-single digits on a reported basis. our life sciences and applied markets group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis and up 4% core. lsag growth is broad based. the cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates. in terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits and pharma high-single digits. lsag remains extremely well positioned and is outperforming the market.
the agilent crosslab group came in with revenues at $518 million. this is up a reported 9% and up 7% core. acg's growth is also broad based across end-markets and geographies. our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activity on our customer labs continues to increase. the acg team continues to build on its already deep connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic and continue to drive improved efficiencies in lab operations.
for the diagnostics and genomics group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported and up 7% core. growth was broad based, with nasd oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%. the genomics and pathology businesses continued to improve during the quarter. i'm also very proud of our nasd team for successfully ramping production at our new frederick site this year. we have built a very strong position in this attractive market with excellent long-term prospects for high growth.
let's now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results. despite the disruption, uncertainty and economic turmoil of dealing with the global pandemic, the agilent team delivered solid results. we generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis and up nearly 1% core. to put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth. in q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first impact of covid-19 in our business in china. both q2 and q3 declined low-single digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted broad shutdowns. with 6% core growth, 8% reported in q4, we're seeing business and economies start to recover. as a result, we are clearly exiting 2020 with solid momentum.
our recurring types of businesses represented by acg and dgg proved resilient, growing low-to-mid single digits for the year. in a very tough capex market, our lsag instrument business declined only 2% for the year and returned to growth in the final quarter. china led the way for our recovery with accelerating growth as the year progressed. in our end-markets, pharma remained the most resilient and food markets recovered most quickly. full-year earnings per share grew 5% during fiscal 2020 to $3.28. the full-year operating margin of 23.5% is up 20 basis points over fiscal 2019.
as we head into 2021, we do so with tremendous advantage. our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continue to deliver. our ability to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions is also serving us well. the way our sales and service teams have been able to quickly pivot to meet customer requirements during the pandemic has been nothing short of remarkable.
last year at this time, i used this call to remind you of the agilent shareholder value creation model. our approach is focused on delivering above market growth while expanding operating margins along with a balanced deployment of capital. we prioritized deployment of our capital, both internally and externally, on additional growth.
a few proof points on our growth-oriented capital deployment strategy. a year ago, we spoke about recently closing the biotek acquisition and the promise of growth that biotek represented. today, biotek is no longer a promise but a driver of growth. in total, the cell analysis business generated more than $300 million in revenue for us during the year, with double-digit growth in q4 and continued strong growth prospects.
similar to last year, i was talking about ramping up our new frederick site facility, a $185 million capital investment. in addition to successfully ramping frederick as we planned, we did so with an expanding book of business. we also recently announced additional $150 million investment to our future manufacturing capacity. we are aggressively adding capacity to capture future growth opportunities in this high-growth market.
even in the face of the pandemic, we stayed true to our build and buy strategy. we have clearly seen the advantages of our approach. i'm confident our strategy will tend to produce strong results for us. the strength of our team and resilience of our business model has served us well, and as you can see from the numbers, our growth strategy is producing outstanding results for our customers, employees and shareholders. while uncertainties remain, as we begin fiscal 2021, we're operating from a position of strength. because of this, we're cautiously optimistic about the future.
we have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results and working as a one-agilent team on behalf of our customers and shareholders. as i noted earlier, i couldn't be more pleased with the results the agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. thank you for being on the call today, and i look forward to your questions.
i will now hand the call off to bob. bob, you're up.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everyone. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional revenue detail and take you through the fourth quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we saw strong growth exceeding our expectations, especially considering the ongoing challenges associated with covid-19. for the quarter, revenue was $1.48 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 5.6%. reported growth was stronger at 8.5%. currency contributed 1.7%, while m&a added 1.2 points to growth.
from an end-market perspective, pharma, our largest market, showed strength across all regions and delivered 12% growth in the quarter. both small and large molecule businesses grew, with large molecule posting strong-double-digit growth. we continue to invest and build capabilities in faster growth biopharma markets and offer leading solutions across both small and large molecule applications.
the food market also experienced double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 16% increase in revenue. while our growth in food business was broad based, china led the way. and as mike noted earlier, our chemical and energy market exceeded our expectations, growing 3% after two quarters of double-digit declines. while one quarter does not a trend make, we are certainly pleased with this result, and the growth came primarily from the chemical and materials segment.
diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 1% during q4, led by recovery in the u.s. and europe. we continue to see recovery in non-covid-19 testing, as expected, although the levels are still slightly below pre-covid levels. academia and government was flat to last year, continuing the steady improvement in this market, and revenue in the environmental and forensics market declined mid-single digits against a strong comparison from last year.
on a geographic basis, all regions returned to growth. china continues to lead our results with broad-based growth across most end-markets. for the quarter, china finished with 13% growth and ended the full year up 7%. just a great result from our team in china. the americas delivered a strong performance during the quarter, growing 5% with results driven by large pharma, food, and chemical and energy. and in europe, we grew 2% as we saw lab activity improved sequentially, benefiting from our on-demand service business in acg, as well as from a rebound in pathology and genomics as elective procedures and screening started to resume. however, while improving, capex demand still lags our service and consumables business.
now turning to the rest of the p&l. fourth quarter gross margin was 55%. this was down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily by a shift in revenue mix and an unfavorable impact of fx on margin. in terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 24.9%. this is down 20 basis points from q4 of last year, as we made some incremental growth-focused investments in marketing and r&d, which we expect to benefit us in the coming year. the quarter also capped off in full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019.
now wrapping up the income statement, our non-gaap eps for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year. our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%.
in addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong. in q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, up more than $60 million over last year. and in q4, we continued our balanced capital approach, repurchasing 2.48 million shares for $250 million. for the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt. all in all, a very good end to the year.
now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year. we and our customers have been dealing with covid-19 for nearly a full year and are seeing our end-markets recover. visibility into the business cadence is improving. and as a result, we are initiating guidance for 2021. there is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions, and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically. it is with this perspective that we're taking a positive but prudent view of q1 in the coming year.
for the full year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% and core growth of 4% to 6%. this range takes into account the steady macro-environment we're seeing. it does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shut downs like we saw in the first half of this year. in addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow, led by dgg. we expect dgg to grow high-single digits, with the continued contribution of nasd ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics. we believe acg will return to its historical high-single-digit growth, while lsag is expected to grow low-to-mid single digits.
we expect operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorb the build out costs of the second line in our frederick, colorado nasd site. and then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks. all this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-gaap earnings per share expected to be between $3.57 and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint.
finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our nasd expansion. we have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders.
now let's finish with our first quarter guidance. but before we get into the specifics, some additional context. many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in covid-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty. and while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for q1, because of the current situation with the pandemic.
for q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing reported growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. and first quarter 2021 non-gaap earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share.
before opening the call for questions, i want to conclude by echoing mike's comments about the amazing work the agilent team performed during fiscal 2020. to be where we are now after knowing where we stood in march is truly remarkable. add to this, the strong momentum we saw in q4, i truly believe we are well positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021.
with that, ankur, back to you for q&a.

ankur dhingra -- vice president of investor relations
absolutely. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of tycho peterson from jpmorgan. your line is open.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, thanks, congrats here on the pre-announcement. on that note, mike actually, i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what drove the delta to the pre-announcement and then importantly on sustainability, it sounds like you're not really calling out any kind of pull forward here. curious as we think about it and particularly that biopharma strength in the mid-teens growth in lc and ms, how are you thinking about the sustainability there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, tycho. thanks for the recognition, really proud of the performance to even top our earlier revised expectations for the quarter and i'd say that as we got into january, business in january was stronger than we had anticipated and i think it was on a geographic perspective, you saw the strength in china. obviously, that was higher than we're thinking as long as really good strength in the americas led by pharma and the food market i'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about the food market, which had both growth in china as well as the americas. and then no pull forward. so it was a clean quarter with january being stronger than we had anticipated when we already had announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. bob i don't know if i missed anything on the --
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no, you got it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
okay so thanks for the comments, tycho.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
[speech overlap] and then on the lc/ms strength, up mid-teens, certainly better numbers than we're seeing from a lot of your peers. can you just talk to that?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think that it's a continuation of the story that's been under way for several quarters. you know we've continued to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings coupled with our approach to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customers needed us most. we're getting the business and it's very clear that not only is it a whether we saw -- particularly in some of the pharma and non-covid areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital they had allocated for 2020. we got all that business, but it's more than that. it is a market share gain story as well for us. so i think it's a combination of backdrop of investment by the pharma world, but also our ability to gain share and bob, i know you've taken a close look at this and --
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i think tycho to mike's point i think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio and our offerings to our customers and i think one of the things that we've seen is our responsiveness continues to improve and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen and as mike said, as the year-end capex spending happened, we were there and i think we took more than our fair share and we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. mike talked about the investment in the masshunter software, which i think is going to really help continue this momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint and it's an area of focus and we're very excited about the biopharma business going forward.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and there's a real holistic story here as well. you know the story already tycho with our acg business complementing -- on the services and consumables complementing what we can do on leading innovative instrument solutions.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and before i hop off, just one on acg, you grew mid-20s in china off of low teens comp. so i thought like the bar was low. are you do anything there structurally to kind of drive that acceleration?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you know what, i'm going to let padraig talk a little about that. padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on that?
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, agilent president, agilent crosslab group
yeah, thanks, mike. i think it's a combination of our scale on our service business in china and our connection with customers and also we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities in china, which is really seeing a lot of pull through from the customers in all markets. so really driving the business forward and we see it sustaining over the next period.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
tycho, just to build on what padraig is saying, i mean this is an area we've also increased our investments in people on the street and as we think about, mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing revenue into service contracts. this is an area where we've had a specific focus in china there and it's really helped us and so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in china.

your next question comes from the line of brandon couillard from jefferies. your line is open.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, thanks, good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, brandon.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe mike, could you elaborate on your comment as far as beginning to see some improved activity in the c&e market and maybe bob, could you give some color on instruments versus aftermarket growth in the first quarter.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we're really talking about order activity, right. so we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field teams, particularly in the area what i would call high value chemical, specialty chemicals. so there's a lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now and i think our customers are feeling more confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming quarters and as you know this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been deferred and we're seeing -- continue to see strong pmis, but as you heard me before -- i shared the story before, brandon, i'm always reluctant to call the turn until we actually see a couple of quarters. so while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready yet to put it into the formal guide for the year.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and just on the second part of your question, brandon. our instrumentation was roughly flat and acg was up mid-single digits.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, bob. then one follow-up for you, bob. gross margins in the first quarter were a little better than we expected. are you still thinking that the full year is still relatively flat to down and any chance you could quantify the impact of the nasd capacity build on gross margin in the first quarter?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, it was a little lower than -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we continue to ramp up, so it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter. if you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year. and that really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. and in terms of the overall year, i would say we're slightly more optimistic kind of given where certainly the first quarter came in and that's part of the increasing our top end i would say of the margin expansion. it's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating expenses.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from the line vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey guys, congrats on a really solid start to the year and thanks for taking my question. i guess for my first one, mike. the guidance here, i guess, q2, your comps are pretty easy. you just did 11% in q1. could you perhaps comment on the q2 and why that should step down and when you look at the annual from an end market perspective, if c&e didn't change i guess is this biopharma that's changing for the annual outlook?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
let me take a shot at it and then i'll turn it over to mike. vijay, thanks for the acknowledgement. yeah, i'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter. if we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the regions that we see the uptake and we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet putting it into the forecast. it's still the end of the quarter. as mike said, we're seeing a lot of business activity. we're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into orders and then ultimately into revenue. so everything there is moving in the right direction and we would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year.
if i look at q2, we did have a higher than expected budget, year-end budget dynamic that helped obviously the 11%. that doesn't repeat itself in q2, but if you looked at -- we feel very confident about the continued momentum of the business going forward.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and that was probably a couple of points of growth, maybe.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, it's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yeah.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then i guess just for my follow-up, is the guide assuming those covid elements that you mentioned, 200 basis points in q1, is that going to sustain and i'm curious what is driving the margin strength here i guess relative to your prior guide.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes so i'll take the first one. so we're still in that 2% kind of a revenue range for covid. so that's a good number to lock into.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and i think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume and i think that that when we have that strong growth, you actually see it go into the bottom line. when you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we more reflecting the pandemic and so forth that we think about q1 to q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and vijay, i'm sure you had a chance to look at jacob's margins for the first quarter, but the lsag had very strong margins and that's when you have double-digit growth in lc, the strength in the cell analysis business. we had indicated when we acquired biotek to be normally high growth but also a high margin company and i think you're seeing it in the numbers.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
absolutely. thanks, mike.

your next question comes from the line of puneet souda from svbl. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svbl -- analyst
all right, great, thanks. mike, bob, congrats on the quarter really strong here. so my first question is on china, which you alluded to a little bit before. obviously, a strong quarter, but just walk us through where do we stand today in china food and where the products are resonating. what's your outlook here? obviously, this has been a market that has been improving for you after some disruptions a while ago and i just want to get a sense of where it stands and how should we think about it going forward?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, puneet. first of all, thanks for your kind comments and i'll make some initial introductory comments here about china food and i'll invite jacob in this conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here. so this is a quick reminder to the audience. you may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of over two years in the china food market as a result of the reorganization of the china food ministries and we always had been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national level and now that situation has completely changed, which are there is reinvestment going into new technologies at the national level. in addition to the testing volumes continuing to grow for the contract testing lab side picking up the volume and jacob i think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent president, life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely mike. so you're right that we are seeing a broad based interest from our portfolio but particularly what stands out is our triple quad both the lc/ms and the gc/ms, which is sought after especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used and what we have developed here is one workflow, one sample prep that could be used for both technologies. so that is that very much better performance versus many other where you have to have two different kinds of setup. so we see a lot of interest in that and so the triple quad is really paving the way right now.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and jacob invested in a china solution center as well. so we actually again, based on these leading technology platforms, able to tailor our solutions for that china food market. so we're really excited about the change in the business volume there as you can imagine.
puneet souda -- svbl -- analyst
that's great. and if i could also ask in terms of pharma in china. could you maybe just elaborate your positioning there. you had really strong growth here in terms of the both small molecules and bio molecules as well. maybe just if you could characterize that. is the bio molecule growth largely coming from nasd. is that what's driving that part of component and the small molecules, you had really strong growth too. so maybe if you can parse that out.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. specific to china, there's no nasd volume at all. it's zero in china. so that's purely on the -- on what we call the lss side, which is acg and lsag business.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and i was going to say, puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out nasd, biopharma in total, so this would be our acg and lsag businesses together along with some contribution at dgg, grew 20% and that was really broad-based across all regions. actually, it was faster than that in china but if you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bob, i'd just add one thing. although we don't have direct nasd business in china, as bob highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for lc/ms-based solutions, for oligo-based r&d research and the fact
that we're in this business ourselves with our own api business and that we have a state-of-the-art facility in our frederick, colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our customers doing research in this area
as well. so i do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into china, albeit on what we're seen on the research side.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and that small molecule in china was very strong.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
oh, yes, sorry about that. i missed that one. yes, how could i miss that one?
puneet souda -- svbl -- analyst
that's great. all right, thanks guys.

your next question comes from the line of dan leonard from wells fargo. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so first question, still trying to think of how to interpret your chemical and energy comments. the comps get pretty easy for that end market. and it doesn't sound like the 2% you reported in the quarter reflects what you're currently seeing on the order side. are you still expecting kind of flattish chemical and energy performance through the balance of the year or could you help me with that?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. and then, bob, maybe you can answer the ---
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, mike mentioned the headline quite well and as we think about the chemical and energy, we've built in some slight improvement in q1 and q2, but have not made any changes to the back half.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and by the way, dan, i'm not trying to be coy here or cute. we've just seen this market can easily can turn on the dime and i've had experience where i've called it too soon. so once we feel confident about the book of business we have inside agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for the year.
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, agilent president, agilent crosslab group
mike, i think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. and as you know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio both from an instrumentation, but also from an informatics point of view. so when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that should have been part two of my headline, when the business is there, we're going to get it.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay and i appreciate that. and mike, you've seen a lot of budget cycles. could you maybe put what we just saw in the quarter in context, you had a strong quarter, and i know share gain is part of that. all your peers had a really strong quarter. are we going to look back at this period a couple of years from [technical issues] particularly in pharma? was this one for the history books or was this just a good flush? like how would you characterize that?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i sure hope that it's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic and what we saw was some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the -- our q2, q3 because of covid-19 concerns and just the fact that customers weren't working, deferred the capital, but again, i would have to say there's more to the story in our q1 than just that budget flush.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i was going to say, i would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. i don't know but i think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in q4 as well, we started seeing the turnaround and we saw it continue through q1 and we're expecting that to continue into the rest of this year as well. so it's not just a one quarter phenomenon. certainly, it was stronger than we anticipated, but we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, thanks for the context.

your next question comes from the line of doug schenkel from cowen. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
hey guys. thank you for taking my questions. so my first question is on share gains. in your prepared remarks, and actually, i think even in the press release, you highlighted market share several times in the context of the strong revenue growth you delivered in the fiscal first quarter. i'm curious if you could opine on where you think you're taking the most share and how sustainable this is? so that's the first topic. the second is on m&a. and the balance sheet is clean. you're reupping on the share buybacks. i'm just wondering how you're thinking about m&a, and more specifically, the parameters that you are using to evaluate potential acquisitions moving forward? thanks guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, doug, thanks a lot for that. happy to opine on both questions. so we really wanted to make sure the story came through that we had this a great start to 2021 and it wasn't just about a year-end budget flush. there's some really good things that have been going for several quarters and this continued in the first quarter and we very specifically chose the language in key areas. so we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. i would point to liquid chromatography. i would point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. i'd point to our services business and bob what else might you add to that? i mean, i think it's pretty much broad-based.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah and in our oligos business.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, oligos because it always comes in three, the oligos, i mean we had outstanding growth in q1. so we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers for the entire company. and then relative to the m&a, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter, this past quarter, i should say, we're gone anti-dilutive but our priority remains, as we communicated in our december investor and analyst day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital expansion building down nasd, for example, but also growth accretive m&a and that remains our priority.
you may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments that the discussions with potential targets, the deal activity is picking up and i think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our space, but i'd say the volume of discussion has much increased over the last quarter or two. so nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. and bob, anything else you want to add?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, the only thing i would say is, doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our framework really hasn't changed. we're looking at markets that are faster-growing than the markets that we are in or sub-segments of those markets. we think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne that out with acea as well as biotek in the cell analysis space and it's really helped continue that shift to higher growth markets, and that's the area that i would think -- and there's really opportunities across all of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream as well. so that's the way i would think about it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and doug, we continue to look for companies also not only to meet that criteria, but also we think are a strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the overall agilent family so to speak, and also a business where we think we can make that business even better.

matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my questions. nice solid quarter, guys. mike, i just wanted to focus on, if you -- when you look at the dgg operating margin in the fourth quarter, it was obviously very strong. just in terms of sustainability for that, what was driving that and what should we expect as we go forward in '21?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bob, do you and sam want to tag team on this?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, i'll start and then turn it over to sam. i mean you see the strength really was volume-driven here and when we look at it and as we ramp up that nasd facility, that's generated a very nice incremental growth on the bottom line. as we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really start showing up yet there but i think that -- and then some of the qpcr activities and related have really helped drive this. sam?
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent president, diagnostics and genomics group
yes, bob, great lead-in. i'll just add, as you said, nasd, that business, we are in a place where we are using more and more our capacity and that's a good thing as it relates to margin. on the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products such as our sureselect ngs target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter and we anticipate that continuing to grow. that's high margin. we have leadership in ngs quality control and it's not just instruments there, there's ongoing consumables that go along with standards. so we expect our leadership position for that to grow. and we haven't talked about in a little while, but this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication for pd-l1 to go along with keytruda for triple-negative breast cancer and that's another place where we have leadership and drives good margin for us.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and just one quick follow-up. just more of a high level. as you continue to grow your acg franchise, could you just talk about how that impacts some of the divisions? and as you expand your reach, does that really help drive the lsg division and other types of segments that you have just given that it just continues your reach within the market and deeper customer penetration?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, matt, you're on the right theme here. so in fact, when i talked about this most recently inside agilent, i talked about this is where our lsag and acg businesses come together and there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help one another, right? so i pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in lc, lc/ms in q1, but it also was tied to the enterprise services story we've been talking about for a number of years. and when you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers, they truly see you as that valued partner.
and for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you and you show them collectively -- or i should say, actually objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to agilent instrument side. also, i think as bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. on our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic and they remembered that, that we were there for them and that translates into instrument business when they're doing their next round of capital purchase. so i think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship and although we run them as we show the outside world two separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers.

hey, thanks. thanks for taking the question, guyts. this is mike on [speech overlap]. i want to follow-up on one thing you touched on earlier. i mean, we've already hit on lc and just broader pharma markets a little bit. you had a comment of higher growth and pharma expected going forward. i just wanted to go a little deeper and try to get a sense for what are the key drivers here because there's so many moving pieces. you've got the end of your flush and maybe some catch-up in covid early in the year. nasd obviously doing very well. selling out is becoming a bigger part of the picture. you've got the share gains. so i'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader, higher levels of spend in pharma? are we at the start of another lc replacement cycle? if you pay off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going forward for the next couple of years that would give you confidence that that's a little more sustainable? i got a follow-up to that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here and then bob we welcome your commentary here as well. so some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expected to be higher growth for years to come. and that was part of our story back at the december analyst day where we talked about, hey, we think rna-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. and that's why you're seeing this growth in nasd happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. immuno-oncology is an area of major investment right now and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago.
so we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come. so i think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio toward those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. i think in general, we expect the biopharma r&d investments to continue the move to large molecule. when i get the question around lc replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on but what i do think is going to happen is, it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. so we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma and i think it's a market i know we're betting on right now at agilent.
mike ryskin -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, that's really helpful, appreciate that. and then my follow-up on that is, by our math, if you take the magnitude of the 1q beat and then also the stronger fx tailwind for the rest of the year, that accounts for roughly $175 million of the raised fiscal year guide. and maybe you have these other items coming in. you mentioned the covid test. you've got all your comments on the strength in the current market. so where exactly is the downside risk? i mean, especially given the comps over the next couple of quarters, what are the areas we should be keeping an eye on that would keep you from doing something closer to 10%-plus quarterly?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question and i think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right? there's still the variance out there. we haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things that we're watching. and we haven't built any of the covid testing that you just talked about into the numbers. so that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. and that's not all within our control. the development and those timings are within our control, but ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the qpcr side that we feel confident about and that would be on top of these. and then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the c&e market is more biased toward the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. and so we feel good about where we are. we're early in the year and --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we're just one quarter in.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
but we don't expect the momentum to abate.
mike ryskin -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks so much.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're quite welcome.

your next question comes from the line of daniel brennan from ubs. your line is open.
daniel brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you. thanks for taking the questions guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, dan.
daniel brennan -- ubs -- analyst
hey mike, maybe on china first, just i don't know if i missed it. did you give what number or what growth rate you're assuming for the full year? and then within that, could you just discuss a bit more detail on the components of that, in particular, food, obviously, very strong this quarter, but how much more catch up potential is there in food given how weak that business has been?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, let me take -- i'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, mike, on the second one.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, absolutely.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
in china, we had forecasted roughly high-single digits at the beginning of the year. it certainly started much stronger than that. so we're expecting it to be double-digits for the full year, really driven by both pharma and food. those would be the two -- the upside drivers to our initial guide. and then i think on food, we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an improvement in q4 and that improvement continued here into q1. and we would expect that to continue given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth but we're not quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think also with food, i'm not sure i would really would use catch up describe this because, clearly, where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work, had deferred investment, i think this has been part of the coming together of the new five-year plan for china, and that's what's really driving this. so we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. i think it's hard to know, dan -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long-term, which it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high-single digit longer term and i think that's probably where we'd land, on your question, although i think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah mike, to your point, in our initial guide, we assume kind of a mid-single digit as the recovery, and it's probably high-single digit to double-digit for the range for the full year.
daniel brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then maybe just one follow-up on the nasd? what was the dollar contribution this quarter? what's kind of assumed in the full year? i don't know if you've changed that at all. and i know you've touched upon this, but in terms of other modalities besides interference, i guess, is that still -- it sounds like it's something that could possibly come, but we're still going to wait to hear from you guys on that. thank you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, what i would say, dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past, $200 million a year. we hit that kind of where we expected to in q1.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we're really happy with how that business is ramping.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
and we're not done yet.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent president, life sciences and applied markets group
hey, bob, i would just add to that, that as i mentioned before, rnai interference is our primary focus, but we are doing programs on guide rna for crispr, and we are at full tilt with that, but we are always looking to be in tune with new modalities and if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely apprised of that as well.
daniel brennan -- ubs -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of patrick donnelly from citi. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. mike, maybe one for you just on the chemical and energy side, certainly appreciate the conservatism baked in here. can you just talk a little bit -- i know in the past, you've talked about kind of the shift from insourcing to outsourcing from customers and how that should play nicely into your strengths. can you just talk about, i guess, where we are in that process and how big of an opportunity that is for you guys?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think we're still early days on that. i think it's -- that's part of the discussion. i think the investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech refresh but i think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and insourcing that we've been talking about and i think this probably points to us being able to be able to sustain a mid-single digit kind of end market. so i mean, it points to the fact that chemical and energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers will not be a drag on the overall growth rate, any material extended off. so i think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth in the c&e market as well albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening in the overall economy.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. now it's going to be the year of durability at least. and then maybe just one --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i like what you said, i should have used durability. that was a short way to answer your question.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
all good. i appreciate that and then maybe just one on the academic side. obviously, that's been lingering a little bit on the soft side, not only for you guys, but for much of the industry. i guess, where do you think we are there in terms of whatever metrics you guys look at, whether it's customers in the labs or whatever it may be? maybe just kind of dive in that a little bit.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. great question. so when we're talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right now. we think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think about 60% are working at reduced capacity. we think about 10% are closed. and we really think it's going to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vaccinations out. i think until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, i'd say, bob, for the -- until we actually see a change in the overall --
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, i think the real catalyst for us, patrick, to mike's point, is what's going to happen in the fall semester for classes. are people -- are students going to be back full or is it still going to be at kind of reduced rates and so forth. so we're expecting continued recovery, albeit slow, really, and that's what we're looking at in addition to some of the kind of the macro levels.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, though, that the conversation with customers is very robust right now. so it's just a matter of things opening up.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks mike, appreciate it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're quite welcome.

your next question comes from the line of steve willoughby from cleveland research. your line is open.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. i had a follow-up question to mike ryskin's question as it relates to guidance, bob. maybe trying to ask it a different way. have you really changed your organic or core growth assumptions over the remainder of the year? because even in the first quarter here, you back out a couple of hundred basis points from sort of end-of-year budget spending, the first quarter still did basically twice what you were initially expecting for growth in the first quarter. and just looking to your guidance and doing some math, it looks like you really haven't made too much of a change for the organic growth over the remainder of the year. is that fair to assume?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would say we took q1. we also upgraded q2 and made some modest changes to the back half of the year, but most of that would be in the areas -- once we get further into the year, that would be an opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. so i think bottom line, you're in the ballpark.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research -- analyst
okay and then just a follow-up question on diagnostics. so i guess two things to it. one, do you think we return to 2019 or normal levels in your non-covid diagnostics business this year? and then also, could you just provide a reminder on where you see your pcr test potentially fitting once it does come to market?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you want to take the first one and sam the second one?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, the short answer is yes, we expect it to get back, but again, latter half of this year. we're starting to see improvement. if you look at it by region, china is back. certain pockets in europe are back and certain places in the u.s. are back as well, but i think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least before it gets back to pre-covid levels.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research -- analyst
very good, thanks.
sam raha -- senior vice president, agilent president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah, with regards to your second question on qpcr, for covid-19, our master mixes, our instruments are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world. when our own test comes to market, we see the opportunity. there's still a dearth of robust testing solutions that are available. so we'll have the right performance going after the right fragments or looking at the right elements of covid-19. and it's really about our broad ability to distribute, make it available and also something that could be automatable on multiple platforms. so we think we'll have a play.
steve willoughby -- cleveland research -- analyst
perfect, thank you. thanks, sam.
operator
our final question today comes from the line of paul knight from keybanc. your line is open.
paul knight -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, mike. how are you?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
all right. long time no talk. how have you been?
paul knight -- keybanc -- analyst
good, so obviously, you've got a full array of products in the analytical instrument marketplace. and it goes back to, i think, doug's question in terms of m&a opportunity. where do you think you are in the full solution in cell analysis? is there a lot to build? is there a lot to buy in that particular market?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
we think so. in fact, thanks for the question, paul. you may recall and jacob, feel free to jump in on this question as well. we teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully really proud of the business we've built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. we're playing in a much larger sam and we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well. jacob, your thoughts there?
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, agilent president, life sciences and applied markets group
yes, certainly. we've been very intentional about how we build out our portfolio. firstly, it's with instrument platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market. and the next thing that would be the logic next step is to look at content, how do we actually get content on our instrument portfolio. so that's clearly an area we're looking into, but i actually think with the footprint, there's also opportunity to add other technique modalities into that. so we have open eyes. we follow what we call the tale of strains -- string of pearls [phonetic] and we wait to put another firm on that strain. and so we keep our eyes open and then see what happens.
paul knight -- keybanc -- analyst
and then the last question would be you had mentioned your cost-cutting program that had started in the second quarter of last year, where you are -- where are you in that process? and what happens to cost-cutting when travel and entertainment might come back kind of post-covid?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, we're seeing some of that. and some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant drop and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes. we're not seeing it go back and our goal is to not have it go back. so we think we're at a new watermark here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. now we are increasing investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some of the capacity that we talked about before, but certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth, we're not looking for that to go back. it will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been doing business before. customers don't want it and we are not going to let it happen.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. to bob's point, as i spoke the other day to our global field team and we were talking about embracing our new ways of working. and of course, a lot of people drove and love to be back on the road, but not everybody feels that way and the customers certainly don't feel that way because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms, there is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on the customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. so we're keenly aware of the question you posed, paul, really challenge ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working and this allows us to put money into areas that really do matter to customers. so i'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment.
paul knight -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you.

mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ankur and thank you everyone for joining us today on our call. i'm very pleased to be on the call for you today. we are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. the agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. the momentum in our business continues. revenues for the quarter $1.55 billion. this is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-january revised expectations. also, as expected, covid-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points to our overall growth. operating margins are a healthy 25.5%. eps of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. overall, a very impressive start to 2021.
our growth is broad based. all three of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. all regions grew with the two largest leading the way. china grew 25% and the americas posted 13% growth. we continue to see strength in most of our end markets led by pharma growing 20%. these results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the agilent team's relentless customer focus. demand remained strong for the full breadth of our offerings. we have been gaining market share in key areas. we are clearly keeping our foot on the gas.
now, let's take a look at our performance by business group. the life sciences and applied markets group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. lsag's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. we are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. cell analysis grew in the high-teens led by biotech, which grew 26%. growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines with both growing in the teens. overall, our lsag business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end of year capex budgets and our market share gains continued. from an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for lsag.
continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our masshunter lc/ms software. this new software enables data integrity consists with important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. as we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the agilent 7850 icp-ms system, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. lsag's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry.
the agilent crosslab group posted revenues of $532 million. this is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. acg's growth is also broad- based across end markets and geographies. growth is strong at both services and consumables. our digital investments in scale are adding significant value. we continue to drive improved attach rates to agilent's large installed base of instruments. annual service contract renewal rates and growth was strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. the diagnostics and genomics group revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. growth is broad-based led by our nasd oligo business. our genomics product portfolio grew double-digit aided by covid-19 related to qpcr demand. we also achieved strong growth in our core ngs sample prep business.
as mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad based across most of our end markets. the pharmaceutical and food businesses led the way both growing strong double-digits. we also posted 10%r growth in the environmental and forensics market. chemical and energy grew 2% and we see an increased business activity in the c&e space. the academia end market is down 1% with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. we're also continuing our efforts in the battle against covid-19. we have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect covid-19 antibodies. we plan to submit to for qpcr based test for covid-19 detection and plan to launch in europe in the next couple of months and submit for emergency use authorization in the u.s. within the same time frame.
i'm also pleased to share that barron's again recently named agilent one of america's most sustainable companies. this marks the third year in a row we've been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. we've also been the leader in our industry all four years that barron's list has been published. we're very proud of this honor. sustainability is a key priority for our company. you know, when i look back on the uncertainty we faced at this time last year, i'm so proud about at what the agilent team accomplished: all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses, and delivering excellent results.
our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we are building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. as we discussed at our december investor event, our diverse, industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on higher growth markets continues to deliver. our m&a finnel front as robust and remains focused on growth accretive m&a opportunities. we are targeting companies and markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth and agilent is in a strong position to win.
as we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. we have solid momentum. we're winning in the market and we have the right team to continue to succeed. as a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. as you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%. so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021 and we have no intention of slowing down. we have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. in december, i shared agilent's long-range plan of margin expansion at 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. we are now guiding toward the top end of that range for 2021. bob will share more details on this in his remarks.
i couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. we have momentum. our team is strong and energized. we are gaining market share in key areas and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. thank you for being on the call today and look forward to your questions. i will now hand the call off to bob. bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon everyone. in my remarks today, i'll provide some additional details on q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results. we are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. core revenue growth was 11.3% while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. n
ow before i get into the end markets, mike's earlier comments bear repeating. all three business groups delivered double-digit growth, core growth in the quarter. our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. pharma, our largest market was strong across all regions delivering 20% growth. growth was led by nasd which experienced significant growth in the quarter, albeit against the easiest comp of the year. nasd contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. we continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the frederick oligo facility and the recently announced capacity expansion in frederick is on track.
small molecule grew mid-teens while biopharma excluding nasd delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for lc and mass spec instrumentation. we saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers and are also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines. the food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. china is leading the way driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. environmental and forensics grew double-digits coming in at 10% core growth. broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs.
our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in covid-related applications, primarily in the americas and europe. our pathology business grew slightly as non-covid testing continues to improve, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels globally. while our diagnostics and clinical end market in china is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-covid testing and the uptake of our clinical lc/ms. the chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in q1. we continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. and while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. and as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. we continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021.
on a geographic basis, all regions grew. china grew 25% leading all geographies led by the food and pharma markets. the americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth while europe was up 6% both also led by pharma and food. now turning to the rest of the p&l, the first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. this is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year driven by volume and spending discipline and this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter. our top line growth coupled with our operating leverage helped deliver eps of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. our tax rate was 14.75% and our share count was 309 million shares as expected.
now on to the cash flow and the balance sheet. our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. in q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's one-time tax payment. this performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. we continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our annual investor event in december. in the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. and as we announced earlier today, our board of directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt.
now moving on to the outlook. we have had a strong start to the year and while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates and as a result, we are increasing our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. for revenue, we are increasing our full-year to a range of $5.825 to $5.900 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. this increase reflects strong q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. the increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. the academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans and while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook.
in addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or qpcr covid assay in the outlook. as mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. during the investor event in december, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. however, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being toward the top-end of that range, while also investing for future growth. the higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares increases our fiscal 2021 non-gaap eps to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. this is growth of 16% to 19% for the year.
now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. we expect second quarter 2021 non-gaap earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the one-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in q2 of last year. now, before opening the call for questions, i want to say i couldn't be more proud of the agilent team in driving such strong performance. we've gotten off to a great start this year and i'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. we have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me to believe that we're on a very solid path for q2 and the rest of 2021. with that, ankur, back to you for the q&a.

absolutely. [operator instructions] first question will come from vijay kumar of evercore isi. please go ahead.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a pretty impressive half year. i did want to start on pharma biotek. it accelerated sequentially the number, it's really impressive, 35 on large molecule plus 28 in small molecule, so maybe talk about what is driving this maybe at a high level, if you can talk about what is your end market growing. is this a market acceleration? are you guys gaining share and how much of this is incremental contribution for nasd? i think the prior assumption was $200 million in the fiscal coming in about?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, there was a lot to unpack there vijay.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take the -- congratulations vijay and i'll pass the line. no. yes, we're extremely pleased with the results that we've seen in the pharma business really across all three of our end business groups. i think it shows the investments in the great execution by the team that has been paying off over the last several years and i think what you're seeing is not only a market recovery for sure, but i think the relevance of our portfolio across all three of our business groups in that business, and certainly we are benefiting from the investments to expand capacity and new therapeutics across various end markets. but i also think the number of new products that we have launched in this space are really seeing a nice uptake.
and on nasd to your point, i mean, we saw nice growth in nasd was in the high 30s and we are still on track to that $200 million that you talked about. and feel very good about that business going forward.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
and my perspective, i think we're capturing share in a faster growing market. so i think there is a combination of both above expectations on market growth, but we're also getting more than our fair share of that market.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful comments there. mike one question on perhaps the more medium term question and i'm not asking for guidance, but i think the question on the group has been, the comps are going to be pretty hard for some of these companies. certainly covid diagnostics has been [technical issues] i think you guys are one of the cleanest stories here in the group. but again, if i'm looking at this guide of high teens, perhaps talk about maybe broad strokes what is sustainable, it looks like some of these trends, biopharma share gains etc should be sustainable? maybe some product line on that, how to think about the plus and the minuses?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
if i may, if i can start with some comments. so i think if there has been a positive on covid, i think it's actually stimulating to some increased levels of investments in some of these end markets. so we think that that some of these growth rates we've seen from the markets perspective are sustainable for a while. and we mentioned earlier, our story is a core business story. we've been very pleased that our team has been able to participate and have a role here to play in the fight against covid-19, but our story really is all about what we're doing in terms of driving the core business.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thanks guys.

your next question will come from tycho peterson of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. i wanted to actually start with the m&a question just on resolution. their obviously a clia lab but have a distributed model as well. can you just talk about those two businesses. i know the overall revenue contribution this year is like $50 million, $55 million. but how do you think about leveraging both the clia lab and the distributed model across your portfolio going forward?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. tycho thanks for the question and good afternoon. i'll make a few comments here and i'll pass it over to sam. so my comments are going to be, we're very excited about having resolution bioscience team as part of agilent. and sam, i think we were even becoming even more excited now that we've had even a deeper look about what's been going on with the company and i think you've just come back from a visit from with the team. so you've had a chance of our -- because made perhaps your first face to face business trip and well over the years, but with that lead in why don't i pass over to you and answer tycho's question.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yes. thanks, mike. thanks for the question, tycho. yes, it was very exciting to finally get out and see real human beings again and very exciting to the enthusiasm of the team there. and first-hand what is now part of our company and tycho the specific answer is both parts are important, the primary business today that we have in resolution bio is related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional cdx business here at agilent, it's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop companion diagnostics, which will ultimately block [phonetic] the market. there is some testing that's done in the clia lab as you mentioned, there is a relationship with labcorp, and that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for labcorp and also testing that will result from actual companion diagnostics that are approved as part of the former work that we're doing, but both are important, but the substantial part of our revenue today in this year, and even in the coming 18 months-24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
that's the focus.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then on the quarter. two quick follow-ups mike, food up 22%. i know you talked about all regions and segments strong and sustained momentum. but we don't think about that market being 20% plus growth sustainably. so can you just talk about whether there is stockpiling? how much of this is china coming out of the overhaul there? and then totally unrelated question on acg operating margins, they were down about 90 bps. i'm just curious is that reinvestment there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. you're close study on the numbers, i can see it tycho, but thanks for two good questions. so, while we're super pleased with the overall growth rate of food, it's been our story here for a number of quarters. we don't expect it to be a 20% growth rate in '22 and years beyond, but we are expecting continued strength throughout this year, probably not at that same level. and bob, i think it's really a clinical that china is part of that story, but in fact, when we look across the globe, it's been a -- we also saw strength in other geographies as well. and i don't have exact...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, that's right.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
geographic split, but it was a broad-based kind of story, with china leading the way, being the key part but not the only part of the story.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, absolutely, tycho to mike's point i think we see this kind of reverting back over time, but certainly what we're seeing is increased investment and increased testing here really around the globe. and china was actually slightly lower than the overall core business, you saw a strong recovery both in americas and europe and the rest of asia. and i think we're seeing some halo effect of covid testing kind of a surveillance testing in various aspects of china or of food testing. and so i think we feel very good about the business there. and then i think on your question...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob i just want to add one thing. additional thought in the americas, historically that's been a lower growth rate for us in food. but with the inclusion of the cannabis testing market we're getting a bit of a bump there as well.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, thanks. thanks, mike. and i think what you're seeing in the acg business tycho, is a combination of two things. one is some reinvestment, we continue to double down in areas like the digital investments to continue to increase our capabilities there and then you did see some increased activity, and so as we -- we actually see this is a good thing. our sales and field service engineers are traveling to more customers. and so we're seeing some increases there associated with just increased activity, which we saw on the on-demand side, but it also comes with some incremental cost.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
but long-term, we feel very good about our acg business and continued ability to scale that business going forward.
tycho peterson -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.

your next question will come from doug schenkel with cowen. please go ahead.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my questions. i'm just doing some math here, and bob i'm trying to make us a little more sense of your guidance. on one hand, you guided fiscal q3 revenue expectations well above consensus. on the other hand your guidance assumes essentially that revenue is going to move sideways, maybe even move i think down sequentially in a quarter, which i think is normally a little bit better relative to fiscal q2, if for no other reason then in china, one of your bigger markets, you don't have a lunar new year in that period. and then we're kind of back into the q4 implied number, there is i think something like 4% sequential growth and a pretty big implied moderation in year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year even accounting for comps. so with all that you've got more m&a in there. and then, i listened to what you're seeing in your prepared remarks, and look at the numbers and it sure seems like you're crushing it with no slowdown. so am i missing anything here?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no, i think you are reading the numbers very well, doug. and what i would say is, certainly, we feel very good about q3 and that's where we have most of our visibility. we still are in a pandemic. but we feel good about the recovery and our -- i think still a little prudent in terms of our forecast going forward. we want to see how the continued rollout of the vaccines are around the world and i think there isn't anything that in the near term that we see is going to stop us from our momentum.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay, all right, that's helpful. and then again doing math on the fly. so hopefully, i'm not messing up anything.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
but your math on the fly is pretty good doug.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
i am doing ok so far. thank you. so it seems like you're assuming operating investment grows 15% year-over-year in the second half or something like that, just backing into that from the top and bottom line. and that seems to be a couple of points higher than the revenue growth rate you're guiding to for the second half. so assuming i'm still doing this right, could you just talk about what some of the key areas of investment focus are? it seems like you're planning on maybe opportunistically pulling forward some investment even separate from the m&a? and then building off of that, if you are in a position to drive revenue upside relative to guidance, do you think it's possible we could see flow through to the operating line and the bottom line along the lines of what we saw in the second -- in the first half of the year?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, the short answer on that, let me take the question around investment. the biggest investment that we have going forward is really the addition of the resolution bioscience business and continuing to invest behind the capabilities there both from an r&d and development perspective as well as the channel. and so that that does have an outsized investment relative to the second half versus the first half where we didn't really have that in here, but we are continuing to invest in demand driving activities. some of those things like we just talked about in acg around the digital aspects but also building capabilities to continue the momentum going forward, whether it'd be marketing programs and other activities within our r&d pipeline.
and i think the last question that you had is, if we do have upside, will it drive the same kind of level of incrementals? and i would say the answer is yes.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay, super helpful. thanks guys.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, thanks doug. appreciate the comments.

dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. so first off on the core analytical business, do you think you've seen any benefits from onshoring through the order book or the revenue line as of yet?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
dan. hey, thanks for the question. not yet. we've talked about it with you in prior quarters and we still think it's a area of interest of our customers in terms of future investment, but nothing material yet. this is the core kind of reinvestment happening in the chemical and materials side of c&e and as you heard in our prepared remarks, the order book actually was stronger than the revenue book. so pointing to a recovery of this segment which in passive and fairly cautious about in terms of calling it, but the trends are positive now.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and mike, i want to ask a follow-up on resolution bio, you kind of assume this a build the future positive updates to come there. can you talk about to invest in that business. and the reason i ask is, it does seem like a driver of success in that space is it willingness to absorb losses for long periods of time. so can you talk about how you plan to invest in the business and how that fits your overall operating model? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm not sure i accept the premise that do you need to have huge operating losses to have the business depend on the type of play you're trying to make here. and bob and sam you guys, keep me honest here as well, but pharma services business model we have where we can leverage a lot of investments that we've already made around our ihc base cdx business, we're not in the same position increment there perhaps maybe start up some of it brand new and win the space. we have something to build from. so i think our expense structure may look perhaps look different than others in this space. we do plan to invest aggressively on the r&d side as well, building out additional commercial relationships. but we think our plan has been to absorb within the overall operating model. so there wasn't any asterisk when we put our long-term goals out and said well without res bio, so i think we believe that we can manage within our overall operating model and i think given where we're starting from, which is we're not starting from zero in this business. we have something to build from our acquisition, a number of years ago from darko. i think that puts us in a different perhaps a different place. anything else add to that...

next question comes from derik de bruin of bank of america. please go ahead.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, sorry, had the mute on, sorry about that. so can you talk a little bit more about the lcms growth and the service going on there. and a couple of questions on that one. first of all, i've asked this question about are you seeing an accelerated replacement cycle in that market or any of your markets. basically, are people feeling good about budgets. you're spending a little bit more than they had so that general question. and i guess one of your competitors has been talking about new lc platforms, particularly targeting the biologics area. i'm just sort of wondering what your sort of competitive response and product offerings are this will going against that? and then i've got one follow-up.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
it's maybe there are competitive response. but i'm going to pass over to jacob, because we're in the conference room here and i'm looking at him on the screen and he is finally loved to be able to answer your question. derik. so i'm going to pass it over to you, jacob.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yes. thanks, mike. and, derik this is great questions. so thanks for that. first of all the -- what the growth you're seeing both in our lc and lc mass spec, is sharply not a coincidence, it is something we have invested in for quite some years, if you really think about our mass spec portfolio, we have really invested and innovated around the lines of robust reliable on the team and we really see our customers especially on our single and triple quads have really taken off here in the last period of time. i think even before in the food space, where we see a lot of upgrades into triple quads, but clearly in the pharma and biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that, really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. so when you move from small molecule things, the last molecule, we are also seeing that the customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing and hence, they are looking for a different experience and we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms. first of all, to live up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a usability. so that's a big part of our success in what we see and i truly believe there is a lot more to come in that area.
if you look at the lc [phonetic], investing into bio is a part of the game. we have had out at bio lc high end high lc for quite a while now and it is doing very well. we can compete about against everyone in this space and you will see us come out -- continuously come out with new products in that space. so we feel very good where we are, and we'll continue to invest to continue to keep tech market standards very important market for us.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and derik, if i could just add on to that, i think it's fair to say jacob, we're seeing both market expansion, but also some acceleration of replacement market as well, particularly in pharma molecule.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
absolutely.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thanks. and then i'm going to ask you an unfair question, but what the hell. and part of it goes like it is, like all the tools companies that put up really strong results, they're coming off of easier comps and that's great. but i think that everyone sort of focus on the next fiscal year. and the ability to grow earnings. i'm just sort of talk, can you sort of generally share any thoughts on sort of earnings growth next year and will it be in the double-digit range, just your general thoughts right now as people are going to start worrying about the tough comps. not the covid tough comps and then other [indecipherable].
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so bob and i haven't actually compared notes on this. i'll start with a few comments. and then i think we'll probably been in the line that said, potential us tax reformer side, our model has been to be able to deliver double-digit eps growth and i'm not seeing a need to deviate from that in '22.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
agreed.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. have a great day.

your next question will come from matt sykes of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. just maybe in the category its too early, but just look at the growth rate that you guys have been showing in cell analysis. i'm just wondering if you can kind of give us an idea of contribution from that, just given it's been integrated and growing at a pretty good clip. and then also just sort of what you're seeing in terms of customer is largely new customers deepening relationships with existing customers. just more color on cell analysis? thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, matt, i think we'll have bob kind of give a view on the overall size of the business and maybe pass it to you jacob for some more insight on the customer side.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i was going to say, matt, we're extremely pleased with the performance really across all three of the major business groups within cell analysis really driving strong growth. and we are well on our way to continue to drive accelerated growth in those areas. and i would say the margin profile of that business is above the agilent average. and so, i'll let jacob actually talk about some of the areas where we continue to invest in new products such as the cytation c10, but also some of the areas around customer acquisition and what we're doing in the marketplace.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yes, thanks it's great -- another great question. and as you can hear we are super excited about the cell analysis business, particularly i'll focus on live cell analysis by immuno-oncology and urology immunology at the howard. and as bob has also mentioned, we have made some quite some good investments into that space, particularly in also the imaging space where we have recently come out with the cytation 10. i think bob also talked about that, which is a new confocal microscope and what it really does is that it allows we have build it and build it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry level microscope that will compete based on the market and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in biotek. so it is a really mixed unmatched stat that our customers are really delighted about.
and our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the biotek acquisition, which we are now leveraging also for our seahorse. but we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia government and we had a very clear focus there has to move in that and that works very well. so we are excited where we are but i would say that the main growth comes from the biopharma space, but clearly now with the academia government coming back that of course also across the growth.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, matt, just one other thing to add to what jacob is saying, i mean this is an area that if you look at over the last several years, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically. and i would say, given our success in the strength in that marketplace and the strength of our portfolio, those are areas where we continue to look to invest further.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for that. that's very helpful. and then just on diagnostics. your comment that you exit the quarter is stronger run rate. i'm sure some of that sort of catch-up demand from the covid period, but just can you talk about the sustainability and your views on diagnostics throughout the rest of the year?
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yes, that's one where we are -- if we think about the opportunities, we're very, very pleased with kind of the progression of that business recovery throughout the course of the year. if you recall last year, we actually grew in that business and then saw a strong fall off when the pandemic really hit and we're expecting accelerated growth in q3, but this is an area where we're watching to say, is there going to be sustained -- how fast is that sustained recovery going. but all signs right now are very positive from the standpoint of the recovery, not only in our business, but if you look at just the overall testing environment continues to be very positive on non-covid testing. so i think people are getting back into the doctors' for wellness tests, certainly diagnostic tests like cancer diagnostics and so forth, and i think we're seeing the benefit of that going forward. and then couple that with the addition of the res bio business and i think we've got a very compelling portfolio of opportunities to provide to our customers going forward.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you very much.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from puneet souda of svbl. please go ahead.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
yes, hi. thanks, mike and bob. bob question for you. first, what are you baking in for pricing expectations for the year and i think the bigger question here is, your ability to take pricing in the market in case there is a rise in raw material prices and in line with the expectations and then i have a follow-up for jacob and sam.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
that's a great question, puneet, and what i would say is, first of all, just a shout out to our ofs team, our supply chain organization, you've just done a fantastic job of being able to manage the increased demands on a increasingly fragile supply chain or logistics, i would say. and so they've just done a fantastic job of supporting our customers. and as you say, we are starting to see inflationary pressures in these areas, but i would say our contracts are more long-term in nature and the teams have been able to drive with the volume as well as continued discussions, good cost controls there at least in the near term. and on pricing, our pricing hasn't changed. we felt that we had modest price built into our plan. that's what we've seen through the first half of the year and that's what we're assuming in the second half of the year. it depends on what group, but overall, we hadn't built any expectation of significant price increase or decreases into our business.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then a quick one for sam first and then other one for jacob. sam, if you could characterize what are your expectations with the pipeline in terms of mrd, beyond therapy management for resolution biosciences? and if you could also talk a little bit about the regulatory framework? in past you followed pdl1 pharmdx assays into fda accruals. how should we think about the new product launches? are they going to follow a similar path? and then for jacob briefly, could you update us briefly on the open lab efforts and your position in pharma there, obviously with your competitor now being focused again on the -- very much on the core lc position. i'm wondering if you're seeing any changes in the market and i totally appreciate your 1100 and 1200 lcs has done well, but i just want to get a sense of open lab. thank you very much and congrats again on the quarter.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, thank you for the question on the resolution bio, i think [speech overlap]
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
how many questions in there?
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
quick response for you. our primary focus remains therapy selection and that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the agilent side as well as the resolution clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well. now the fundamental technology is, we do believe the minimal to more applications including minimum residual disease and monitoring, but once again our primary focus remains therapy selection.
now in terms of the model, i think you asked about that. it is what we can do before which is we believe as agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for pdl1 where we work, specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics meaning to develop register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they come to market and are approved, tied to a specific indication specific drugs. so that is our model and ultimately our vision is to have ivd kitted ngs solutions that are near to patients that are distributable, but of course as you heard even earlier we've got a clia lab and there's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way, and that's a little bit different than the pdl1 model that we have today, because that's the nature of ngs based diagnostic testing, but our interest and long-term focus remains an ivd kitted diagnostic test. jacob, over to you.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yeah. thank you and let me just start by saying that informatics and open lab is key to our strategy. so, though we like to talk about our instrument, it's always connect -- our most unconnected within a very strong position in informatics, and we continue to invest in open lab, in fact, we believe that is the lab, where we connect all our instruments into an ecosystem in a cloud setup where can you also track your samples and in the end also connect into an e-commerce set up is going to be the future, and with agilent's broad portfolio we can very quickly, we can very well do this. so i'm very excited about that and we continue to invest in fact we have over the last few months decided to further invest into these areas to further accelerate our presence here.
puneet souda -- leerink partners -- analyst

bob, i know that the instrument business was strong for us in c&e. i can't remember the actual relative ratios. we're looking for our notes here right now to answer your question and going into the q3 its probably our easiest compare in c&e. we're still looking for that stack growth to kind of move up bit on us. but bob?

yes, i was going to say, brandon to your point of that 40% lsag or the instrument business is slightly higher than that and lsag was slightly lower than that, but both double-digit growth. and as we think about where we are going forward in terms of the guide for the third quarter, and it kind of going forward, our assumption for q3 is somewhat similar to q2 in terms of continued recovery of a weak base. it was down 10% again last year -- last q3 and then we started seeing recovery. and so i think about it -- we're thinking about it in roughly the same kind of terms in q3 that we saw in q2.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think right now we're taking it quarter-by-quarter, bob. but i think overall we see this trending being more upside than downside.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
that's right.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
got you. and then just one more, it doesn't sound like, based on your prepared remarks today, but to what extent if at all are you seeing any supply constraints, printed circuit boards or other materials?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
brandon, i just would echo what bob mentioned earlier, our office team that is on a spectacular job, so in our remarks you heard we talked about some strong orders, order growth higher in china and c&e but that was not at all tied to any supply chain constraints. so we've been able to get product. we've been able to ship product and listen, it's not easy, but the teams find a way to make it happen. so i think bob is relatively immaterial at all to the quarter and we think it's manageable moving forward as well.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
that's right.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks.
operator
your next question will come from patrick donnelly with citi. please go ahead.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the questions guys. maybe just following-up -- maybe following up on brandon's question on c&e there. can you just talk through what you're seeing in there a bit more. obviously, the order book growth is encouraging coming in higher than revenue. was that enough to give you confidence that this won't kind of turn quickly on you. i know you've noted historically it's been a bit hesitant to bake into much growth there. i mean this is among the most positive tone i've heard from you guys over the past couple of years. so can you just talk through that and then i guess was that segment the biggest piece recovering the back half guidance raise doing a bit more comfortable about the sustainability there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, patrick. and i'm glad you remember earlier comments, because i always said once the orders here in my book i'll start to talk a little bit differently about it and that's why you're getting more positive tone. i would say that we're still in the early phases of the transition. we feel really good about where things are on the chemical materials side of the c&e. i would say we're starting to see quoting and some initial order activity on the refining side still relatively light compared to the materials and chemicals segments. as you know, the larger part of that business for us, but yes we are. -- i am much more positive, i think it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had this kind of view on the trends we're seeing in the c&e space. and yes, we had in prior quarters seamless pmis but i wanted to see in the order book and i started to see it this quarter.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
and i would say, patrick to build on what mike is saying, we still have -- we're taking it as he said, kind of one quarter at a time. we've built in some of that into q3 and i would still say there is a bias to the upside in q4.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just maybe on the m&a landscape. bob, you mentioned the balance sheet helped, obviously we saw the resolution deal you guys touched on that a few times. should we expect more deals of that nature? are you still on the hunt for something a bit larger? mike, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline activity and the segments you're focused on and then bob, if you want to talk about where the leverage could go, that will certainly be appreciated.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think our view on m&a remains the same. we see that as a key part of our -- we've been terming our build and buy growth strategy. we've signaled that we would be willing to do deals in the multiples of biotek which to date is our largest deal. and that's still a area of interest for us. we like to kind of a growth accretive deals that you're seeing. we're getting great new teams like res bio team, like the biotek, acea, so we are maintaining our focus on higher growth segments. we like the areas we're going, we've been gone after like cell analysis, we like the genomics look at biopsy space, i think informatics others, we have a number of areas that we're continuing to look for growth opportunities.
again, we don't have to do deals to make our model work. but if we can find great new teams and great businesses to bring into the company we're quite willing to do that. you just have to remain disciplined in terms of valuation expectations. there's a lot of frothiness in certain segments of the market, but we're going to stay where we've been successful in the private space, where company founders often looked at and say listen, this will be a great home for my company my team. we like -- we like how you guys run your company, we like your culture, we like to just for in terms of growing the business for the long-term. so we're going to stick to our models in been working for us bob and i think we can adjust the question...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
just quickly, we're not going to give a specific target around that other than to say that our intent is to maintain an investment grade and we ended the quarter at kind of 1 times net leverage and that gives us plenty of flexibility to continue to invest in deals growth accretive deals as mike just talked about.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
okay. thanks, mike and bob, really appreciate it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're very welcome.
operator
and your last question today will come from dan brennan of ubs. please go ahead.
nathan -- ubs -- analyst
hi this is nathan on for dan. just a quick question. to what extent has your upgrade cycle been impacted by the pandemic, and now that we're kind of coming out of the pandemic, are you seeing any traction, any acceleration in the upgrade cycle in any of your instruments or end market?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think to answer your question, i think when the pandemic hit it really slowed down any kind of replacement cycle. particularly i would say in the c&e side of our business. and as we just commented, we're seeing positive indications that that actually is now turning to different direction. so i'd say it's been even in the c&e space that are tied to chromatography spectroscopy platforms.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
i would say, nathan as mike said, still early days, but all the trends are looking forward -- looking positive.
nathan -- ubs -- analyst
great. and just, if i can switch finally, you did mention that you're seeing share gains on top end market growth. can you just elaborate what is driving share gains for you?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
if you think about our -- the combination of our lsag and acg businesses where we come in the analytical lab as jacob mentioned earlier and i haven't had a chance to have [indecipherable] the call yet, but we have been working very well together for multiple years. and you're seeing it by bringing innovative solutions to the market that have a differentiated value proposition from the competition. a superior service experience and i think it's -- we continue to build out our commercial reach as well. so i think it's been the combination of portfolio and the workflow focus within that portfolio, building the service capability and then building out further commercial reach. i think it's been a combination of all those factors helping us to do really well in our lsag and acg groups, and then obviously we talked earlier about the play in cell analysis, which is a new addition to the company in biopharma, and then our nasd play in sam's business. i think it's been a combination of all those factors. so that's why we keep using the word broad-based growth because you see it in all parts of the businesses. so we feel really good about the results from the size we were working on for a while.
nathan -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks.

and now i'd like to turn the call over to mike. mike?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks ruben, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. before i get into the detail -- into the quarterly details, i want to start by recognize our agilent india team. despite the challenging covid-19 situation, our india team is working closely with our cause of do while we can to help in this time of extreme need. in addition our agilent india customer support, finance and it teams have worked tiredlessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. i could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true one agilent fashion. our thoughts go out the entire agilent india team and their families during this difficult time.
in q2 the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovering market. the agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations, both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid q2 last year when revenue and earnings per share were relatively flat. our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets and geographies. we are also expanding margins driving faster earnings-per-share growth. revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. this is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. covid-19 related revenues accounted for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributes about 1 point to our overall growth. our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one that sustained above market growth. for example, our q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from two years ago.
q2 operating margin of 23.9%. this is up 150 basis points. eps of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year. late in the quarter, we also welcomed the resolution bioscience team to agilent, continued our investments in high-growth markets in bringing outstanding talent into agilent. like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, resolution bioscience an example of our build and buy growth strategy in action. the agilent story remains the same. it is a story of one team outpacing the market to deliver strong broad-based growth in an environment of continuing market recovery.
moving onto our end market highlights, we do strongly in all markets. our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. we are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. we also posted low-teens growth in diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. lastly, environmental forensics grew 8%. bob will provide end market detail later in his comments.
geographically, the americas led the way with 27% growth. strength in china, europe and the rest of asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. the 30% growth in china is on top of 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic. as we look at our performance by business group, the life sciences applied markets group generated revenues of $674 million during the quarter. lsag is up 28% on reported basis and up 25% core off a 7% decline last year. lsag's growth is broad-based across all end markets and geographies. our focus in investments in fast growing end markets continues to pay off. the lsag pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. from a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and lcms along with continued growth in cell analysis.
during the quarter, cell analysis grew 34% with our biotek business growing close to 40%. during the quarter the lsag team also contribute to our long-term companywide focus on sustainability in advance and important esg initiatives. lsag announced several new products that have earned the highly respected accountability, consistency and transparency, act label from my green lab. my green lab is a non-profit organization dedicated to improve the sustainability of the scientific research. lsag products will also receive two scientist choice awards and now for the select science virtual analytical summit.
our cell analysis business during the quarter -- in our cell analysis business during the quarter, excuse me, we launched our cytation c10 confocal imaging reader, a multi-functional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity. this product builds on the biotek cell imaging leadership with the cytation multimode leader and expands our reach in the strategic business. while still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. we are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space.
the agilent cross lab group posted revenues of $536 million. this is up a reported 19% and up 15% on the core basis versus a 1% increase last year. acg's growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab actively continues to increase for our customers. this is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption. revenues from our contract business continues to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. our strong instrument placements and the increase in installed base will benefit the acg business going forward. at the same time our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake and consumables and our digitally enabled services offerings.
our lsag and acg businesses come together in the ilab. this is where we believe we are well positioned to continue driving above market growth as we build on our market leading portfolio, strong service organization and outstanding customer service. for the diagnostics genomics group revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus the 5% increase last year. growth is broad-based, led by our nasd oligo and genomics businesses. demand for our nasd offerings remains strong and our capacity expansion plans for a high-growth nasd business remain on track.
we're very pleased with the acquisition of resolution bioscience during the quarter with our liquid biopsy technology, resolution bioscience is the key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. we are very glad to have them on the agilent team. i'm confident as time goes on., you'll be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions.
i would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. the strong momentum in our business continues. this is being driven by our relentless customer focus, the strength of our portfolio and the execution capabilities of the one agilent team. our build and buy growth strategy is delivering as intended of above market growth. over the last year, i've often said, that agilent's focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. i believe you're seeing the impact of this approach in our current results. as we look ahead we do so with a sense about optimism and confidence. we are optimistic, because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio. we are confident, because we have the right team, customer focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. as a result we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. bob will share more details, but we expect that a continuation of excellent top line growth. we also expect to compare this strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation.
during our investor event in december, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. six months into fiscal 2021 we are well on our way to achieving those objectives. our build and buy growth strategy is delivering. the one-agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. we raised the bar on customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services. while we are yet to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence.
thank you for being on the call today and i look forward to your questions. i will now hand the call off to bob. bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon everyone. in my remarks today, i'll provide some additional details on q2 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the year and the third quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. we are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth with all three business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher and all end markets growing strongly. from an end market perspective, our focus on fast growing markets is paying off. pharma, our largest market, again led the way delivering 29% growth. this is on top of growing 5% last year. growth was led by cell analysis lc and mass spec. these tools are delivering critical capabilities to our biopharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines.
our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid 20s in the quarter. overall, we are well positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue to be the strongest end-market as we enter the second half of the year. the food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. we experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply chain. and we were very pleased to see the non-covid diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter, growing 13% as routine doctor visits return closer to pre-pandemic levels.
we posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary, the weak april we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. and we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic level. the chemical and energy market continues to recover as we grew 14% of a decline of 10% last year. our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets and in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong leading us to believe this trend will continue.
we also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-covid related labs resume operations in a strong funding environment. with the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. we would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year. and lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the americas, services and consumables at atomic spectroscopy.
on a geographic basis, all regions grew led by the americas at 27%, the pharma and academia and government markets in americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%. europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia and government and c&e. those three markets all grew more than 20%. and as mike noted, china grew 13% after growing 4% last year. this was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s. our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid single-digits during the quarter.
now turning to the rest of the p&l. second quarter gross margin was 55.4% flat year-on-year, despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency. our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%, driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year, even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. strong top line growth coupled with our operating leverage helped deliver eps of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. our tax rate was 14.75% and our share count was 307 million shares.
now on to cash flow and the balance sheet. our performance translated into very strong cash flows. we delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. the strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy. during the quarter we returned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing 1.55 million shares for $195 million. and as mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business, we spent a net of $547 million to purchase resolution bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures.
year-to-date, we returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while reinvesting in the business by spending $619 million on m&a and capital expenditures. and we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward. during the quarter, we raised $850 million in long-term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1 time.
now turning to the outlook for the full year and the third quarter. we see a great opportunity to build on our strong first half results. looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end markets and have solid momentum in all of our businesses. as a result, we are again increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. this reflects our strong q2 results an increasing expectations for the second half of the year. we are also incorporating the resolution bioscience into our guidance.
for revenue, we are increasing our full-year range to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%. included is roughly 3 points of currency and 0.5 point attributable to m&a. this increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end markets. we see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in pharma, food and environmental and forensic markets. end markets that we expect to continue to recover in the second half include the diagnostics and clinical, academia and government and c&e.
as mike mentioned during our investor event in december, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. and in addition, we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-gaap eps to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. this is growth of 25% to 26% for the year.
now for the third fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. and we expect third quarter non-gaap eps to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%.
now, before opening the call for questions, i want to say we're extremely pleased with how we've started the first half of the year. we believe our strategies and our execution of driving the strong results we've achieved and put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year.
with that ruben back to you for q&a.

definitely, sir. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question is from tycho peterson with jp morgan.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. congrats on the quarter. mike, i want to start with the...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tycho.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
kind of outlook. i know in china, there's been a fair amount of noise about companies being able to do products in-country -- ports being shutdown, terminal shutdown. so, can you maybe just talk to some of the near-term dynamics in china? and it sounds like trade tension's also getting worse with the buy china policy. how do you think about that over the next couple of quarters?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. thanks for the congratulatory comments, tycho. and we really -- actually continue to feel quite good about our performance in china. as bob and i mentioned in the call script, i think 8% up on a 11% last year, and i think our stack growth is around 19% q3. it's actually up over our stack growth of 17% q2. we're seeing this good, strong, pharma and c&e demand in china. now, the funnels really remain quite robust. and i think now getting to your specific question, we're not seeing any significant changes in terms of ability to get product in. i mean, there's been a lot of noise for years, i have to say, between united states and china, yet the business seems to somehow get transacted. so, bob, i think we're not really overly concerned about those dynamics. we did have somewhat of a little bit of shipment interruption as some of our academia government customers were -- had to work through a vat tax exemption change, but i think that was relatively minor impact on the p&l. so clearly we're monitoring those developments and you have to continue to work to make sure you've got the logistics flowing through the country. but we've always been able to find a way and they're not overly concerned about it at this point.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, tycho. we continue to invest in china as we mentioned in the call and there are always bumps here and there, but long-term, we feel very good about the business in china.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's having one other thought here, tycho is relative to logistics. we have divested into a number of forward-looking stocking locations over the last few years, not really has paid us dividend, because we are less dependent on stuff coming directly into the  via the port because we have a lot of in-country inventory.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then it sounds like you've got a lot of underlying momentum. i know you don't like to talk about the order book, but any preliminary comments you can make on '22 at this point. you know, street has you up about 6.5%. curious if you think that's a reasonable bar and any comments on where you think margins may go next year?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, tycho. so, as you might imagine, i'll probably sidestep that question a little bit in terms of specifics. but what i can tell you is that we feel really good about the momentum of the business, the order book is continue to be strong and that's as of today, where we got the latest view of early orders through august. so, order momentum remains there. as i mentioned in our prior earnings call, we feel really good ability to meet and exceed those long-term growth goals we put out the margin goals. i think that's where we stand right now is. we will get to that in november, but we're feeling good about the trajectory of the business momentum we built here.
tycho peterson -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thanks. ill let others hop in.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.

your next question is from brandon couillard with jefferies.

hey, thanks. good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, brandon.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe to start with the biopharma business. i mean, 50% growth in large molecules is pretty impressive. can you just elaborate, given the sources of growth there, and what that would look like if you back out the nasd contribution?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure. and then i'm actually going to invite bob and i will also want to have jacob make a few comments on some of those new introductions here. so i think i used the word broad-based, at least five or six times, maybe 10 times in my prepared remarks and we're seeing that in the biopharma. so we had across the board double-digit growth happening here, cell analysis, lc, lcms, other platforms are going to biopharma along with our consumables and services. and then to your point, really outstanding growth in nasd. but while nasd was a big contributor, it was an agilentwide life story. and bob, maybe you can just answer the specifics on the numbers?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. and brandon, to your point, the total in large molecules was 52% as i mentioned before. but even if you back out the nasd businesses still grew in excess of 40%. so very strong business on nasd, but it shows that the rest of the business, both instrumentations, as well as the consumables pieces and the other elements on the pharma associated revenue in diagnostics and genomics also, very strong business in it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
new introductions into this space as well, which has been the focus and prioritization of our r&d pipeline. jacob, i know we had two big introductions in q3 as well.

yeah, thanks for that, mike. and as i said at the analyst day, i think we talked about in [indescipherable] that 70% of our portfolio above that was really focused on biopharma, so i'm really happy to see that momentum we have right now. and as you also mentioned in the prepared remarks, you know, i'm very pleased what we did with the bio-lc portfolio. in fact, we had and -- one of the [indescipherable] of our momentum is that with that bio-lc that we introduced here a few months ago. and we had a virtual conference with more than 1,000 customers participating, and we had more than 25 external scientific speakers, which i would actually say i know it's the best in in the industry by far. so that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum and it allows us to play for all the biomed, biocompatible space for the 2d-lc, but clearly, also into the mass spec, with the mass spec at the end of it. and we also mentioned compliance. the fda part 11 informatics compliances is another very important part that most of the biopharma sees as a requirement to do business with them. and we have invested in this for quite a while, so we ensure that data integrity, the audit readiness, and storage of data is the level of security. and right now, we have the offering both supporting our lc, but also all our major marketable mass spec instruments. and also, in spectroscopy, with the recent announcement here off the top in the q2 informatics solutions. so right now, we are -- we have a very strong portfolio and that truly drives our growth. well, i can continue talking about the cell analysis, but i will...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i'm going to bounce it back to brandon. hey brandon, thanks for allowing us to do an advertisement on the agilent portfolio strength. but, back to you, to see if you have any additional questions?
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah, i think just touched on maybe if we could just elaborate on the small molecule market. you mentioned kind of qa-qc refresh, curious what we might be in there and what you think the market is kind of growing for small molecule relative to your mid teens.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
it's our view that there is always a replacement market going on in the small molecule space, and sometimes, it picks up a bit more. but then -- and i think we're in that phase right now. i wouldn't say it's a huge acceleration, it's just the solid and probably high single.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, i was going to say, brandon as we think about this prior to the pandemic, we were probably slower growth than normal were some of the qa-qc refresh was probably elongated. and now we're starting to see that pick back up, and that typically is an 18 to 24 months kind of cycle. and i would say we're still at the beginning of that. and so, feel good about the continued performance of the refresh cycle going forward.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question is from vijay kumar with evercore isi.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey guys, congrats on the strong print this afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, vijay.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
maybe. mike, maybe on my first question here, resolution bio, the deal that you guys did, did that come in line with expectations? i'm just curious. the 50-basis points contribution seems a little light. is there some ramp-up phase here that's involved and not? maybe just talk about what the deal does to you and how it adds to the corporate growth rates here?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, you do some very good math. so, it's about half-a-point of reported growth rate, bob. and i'd say relative to q3, probably a little bit behind though revenue as we learn more about this business or some elements of this global lumpiness, so we're feeling pretty good about how our business will finish, but we're expecting a lot in the fourth quarter. i think this is a story of continued acceleration of growth in '22 and beyond. aand we're just super delighted by the early days of how the teams feel about being part of agilent.
and then we're really building scale around this business. so, i think it's still a relatively small part of the overall revenue picture today for agilent and we knew that going in, i think is roughly 50-ish kind of million, but we would expect really strong growth rates in the coming years and again, we really feel like we're off to a great start with this team. just interacting with mark li, who is the founder -- co-founder of resolution bio. he is really happy about the capabilities that we're bringing to his business to further scale it. so early days, but feeling good -- pretty good about things and bob, i dont know if youre...
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i was just going to say the other thing is, obviously, we're just now having more and more conversations with our existing cdx customers and the power of being able to have our established cdx business on the [phonetic] hd side coupled with ngs-based technology, i think is going to be a real significant competitive advantage for us going forward. so very excited about this business going forward.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, mike. and bob, one for you on expenses. in the year-to-date operating expense as a percentage of revenues, you guys were in the low 30s, sub 31%, that's well below your historical level. i guess my question is, is this all just associated with the volume leverage rate given the strong organic performance year-to-date, or are there some timing elements on expenses, thats aiding you, and how should we -- if there are how should we think about those factors coming back in '22?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, vijay, it's a great question. and i think if you remember, maybe a year ago we talked about some of these expenses that were going down, and our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. and these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities, and what we've been able to do is be very successful. certainly, volume is our friend. and the leverage that we've been able to drive across all three of our business groups has really helped. but if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs and digital investments, our digitals investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. and in fact, jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. and so those are our goals are for those to continue. they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic.
so, we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. and that's why mike talked about kind of our long-term margin expansion story is intact. it's not going to be 200 plus basis points like it was this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, vijay, this is mike. if i can just add one additional comment too, and i hopefully came out in my prepared remarks, but we're not holding back on investing for growth. so, we're quite pleased with the margin performance, but it didn't come at the expense of our ability to grow down the road.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's extremely helpful, mike. congrats again. thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from doug schenkel with cowen. your line is open.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. could i -- actually could i just build off of that last question with a quick follow-up. again, acknowledging and recognizing you're not going to guide on 2022 today. i'm just wondering though at high levels, should we assume that incremental margin is going to be a little bit lower than normal next year, if we're assuming a normalization of activity in the post-pandemic world? i heard what you said about areas where you're not going to need to invest as much, but at the same time, you are investing in growth. just mathematically, does the incremental need to be a little bit lower than normal next year?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're still building our plan. but our intent is to still be able to drive that margin expansion. i will say that we are having our new train b in nasd come online, which will add a little pressure to it. but, i think, we've been very good about being able to do 30% to 40% incrementals and sometimes even higher than that when the margin comes in. and i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that, doug.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay. super helpful.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
maybe what's -- yeah, maybe what's underlying your question is inflationary pressures and activities around that, i would say that we didn't see any material impact. obviously, there is some but we're planning to manage that going forward.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
yeah, that's in audits. it's supply constraints, it's inflation or refreshers. it's the hope that we're traveling a little bit more and there are real conferences and real site visits, things like that. so that's the spirit of the question. just making sure that the capture of those dynamics, we don't have to think about something other than that 30 to 40 traditional range. so that's helpful, bob.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i would just add sort of. [indecipherable] we're under 22 now. sorry to interrupt there, but i'd just say that some of our programs, and such are really geared towards making sure we can manage our way through this in '22, so we're on this already.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
got it, okay. in terms of full-year guidance, as it's been noted a few times, you increased the outlook by more than the magnitude of the q3 beat. i guess i'm just wondering what gives you confidence in this change. is it backlog data? is it pacing across the quarter? is it activity through the first month of the quarter? maybe it's all of the above and maybe more importantly...
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
[indecipherable]
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
you just checked everyone? okay. perfect.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah [indecipherable]. bob and i are smiling in the room here, and, i think, we can probably put a checkmark on all, first of those three things you mentioned.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and then throughout the year, you've consistently beaten your own targets pretty maturely, and it definitely makes sense to skew the error bars a bit more conservatively when you set your targets, given the state of the world. that said, given how well you performed relative to those targets, and recognizing we're not out of the pandemic, but we've got a little more experience with it at this point. is it fair to say that you're at the point where you could adjust the philosophy a little bit and maybe kind of change the positioning of those error bars as you set guidance moving ahead?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that that's fair. i think, what we've tried to do is set prudent guidance as we've talked about in the past. but certainly, as we've and our customers, more importantly, the market is getting used to dealing in a covid world, there are fewer variables to be able to understand. and i would look at just what we did in q2 to q3, we dramatically increased our q3 guidance and then did the same thing here for q4. so, i think our visibility is improving. you should take that away for all the things that you rattled off. certainly, the momentum that we're seeing, the general economic improvements, and so forth. but as you mentioned, there's still a delta variant out there, and so well, as mike mentioned, we haven't seen any impact of that yet. we also recognize that that could change during the course of the quarter. so, we're trying to take all those kind of factors into account, but also try to provide some realistic guidance going forward.
doug schenkel -- cowen -- analyst
okay, all right, thanks again, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you're welcome, doug.

your next question is from derik de bruin with bank of america.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hello and good afternoon.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
hey. can we talk a little about environmental and sort of that? and i i want to dovetail that question to -- i know it's probably a little bit early, but any signs of how we should think about the gc portfolio picking up or you just replaced -- is it just sort of like catch-up spending right now in the industrial or any initial indications that the replacement cycle that you were going -- you were in the midst of prior to the pandemic is likely to restart.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, derik. i would like take the first one and bob -- i mean, bob and jacob, you may want to add additional comments here. but let me talk about the question around gas chromatography, so we are seeing that, and that's really behind a lot of the fairly bullish comments, if you will, around c&e space. so, we're seeing it in our gc revenue, and we're also seeing it in our gc order book. and i've been very reluctant to call that hey, we think this business is now in a situation of returning to growth, that reluctance has now passed. i think we're now into what looks to be the start of some really good potential business on our gc side, as that replacement cycle turns back on. and jacob, i know you're a lot closer to the detail. anything else you could add to that?
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yeah, mike, you're absolutely right. i think first of all of the -- i think what bob mentioned that also, the chemicals and engineered materials market is certainly on fire right now, where we see a lot in semicon and in the mining industry, including lithium for batteries, but we also see the traditional petrochem markets really start to see some momentum now. and there's a lot of talk about the future of petrochem, but this market is going to stay for quite a long. and i think that all the analysis shows that there'll be newer cycles here, so we see investments coming into this market right now. and the new market that's also coming along is renewable energy, which will also use many of our technologies. and we see a great opportunity there also in the future. they're still in a development phase, but as you know, there's a lot of investments coming in here, so we are participating in that also. so, we see a lot of opportunities in gc and the gc is actually seeing momentum both first in the chemical markets, but now into the energy markets.
derik de bruin -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, so following up on that. so, you're feeling good about your more industrial expo experiments, even with some of the choppiness in the chinese market, some of the data there. so, are you seeing -- is it the u.s. and europe can start bringing more or is it just that you're seeing turn on in that one? and then where were we -- what remind me in annoying baseball analogies where we were in innings on the gc replacement cycle?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so bob, i think it's fair to say that there really is no difference across the regions. i mean, china actually was area of strength for us in c&e, and i think we're seeing good strength globally, which i think points to the importance of global economic outlook for this segment. and i'd say we're probably early or middle innings on the -- going to pause there for a while because we got rate run going with the new portfolio, but a pause. i'd say we're like early innings, middle innings.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i would say derik just to give you a frame, china was more than twice the china c&e market was -- was in line with the overall, c&e growth rate that we saw.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks for your question.
operator 
your next question is from dan leonard with wells fargo. your line is open.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
yeah. thank you and good afternoon. i was hoping you could -- mike, i was hoping you could address the 5% to 7% core revenue growth model that you've introduced in december. is that still relevant or do you think something has fundamentally changed in the markets from that time period.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say it's relevant till we change it. so i'm not ready to on the fly here, revise our long-term growth. but as you may recall, in our december outlook, we said, think about us being more of the high range in that area. and i think, i've together the tougher, so i put a 7 out there in any type of long-term growth guidance. i think what's changing is the nature of our portfolio, which is we continue to build very quickly, much bigger positions in faster-growing segments. and i think it's probably fair to say that the pharma market, in particular, the biopharma market is -- remains very robust, but again, we're sticking with those long-term growth goals at this point in time.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, dan, to build on what mike is saying, particularly the pharma market. we do feel that that market, and in fact, mike talked about it in his prepared remarks that we're emerging as a stronger company. we do think that the pharma market, really driven by that large molecule area, is a faster-growing market coming out of the pandemic than going into it. and i think if we look at where our investments are and the performance that we've had in particularly the large molecule, now again, small molecule has been doing very well. that, in and of itself, would elevate that overall long-term growth rate to be faster than what we saw going in, which certainly helps us, given that is -- that's our largest market. so, i'll leave it at that
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. that's a helpful clarification. and just a follow-up on china, could you elaborate further on the drivers of that 50% growth rate you called out for dgg in china?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm going to invite sam on this call. he hasn't had a chance to work today in this call. so, sam, your thoughts of what's been going on in china, i was doing a little bragging on your growth rate there.
sam raha -- senior vice president, president, diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. mike, happy to give more perspective on china. we actually had a good quarter across the board for all of our business groups within dgg. specifically, we continue to see real momentum in clinical diagnostic testing, led in pathology. we've seen really good pick up of our pd-l1, and our diagnostic -- or companion diagnostic there, as we've continued to train more pathologists there in the use and so forth. genomics also had a really, really, good quarter, both on the consumable side. and we've also just recently announced within the quarter, the launch of our new v8 xome, which is being well received in china and globally. and i will tell you one of our absolute strengths in china as it is elsewhere, remain our core ngs and genomics qc portfolio. so, all of those elements, along with mike, as you mentioned now, the signing of our first companion diagnostic development agreement with the biopharma there, i think foretell a continued story of strength in china for dgg.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and just to build on sam's comments, i mean, we've been working really hard the last several years putting in the right foundational capabilities, building the right commercial channel, the right ability to handle diagnostics products ourselves, and it's really great to actually see those investment starting to pay off in near term growth.
dan leonard -- wells fargo -- analyst

your next question is from patrick donnelly with citi. your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
mike, maybe one on the chemical & energy side to follow up on some of the earlier questions. i know that's one where you pretty closely keep an eye on the order book and your confidence goes with that. are you getting more visibility as the order book builds there? i'm just trying to compare it to pre-pandemic mid-pandemic, i know you guys had a pretty short leash on in terms of how you would guide for that segment, how comfortable you would allow yourselves to get. just wondering how the order book is looking there relative to some of the past quarters and how you're feeling about that segment. certainly, seems like the tone is pretty positive here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. now i'm glad you picked up on that. we really want that to come through in the call. and i think the confidence is coming from not only the revenues that we've reported, but as bob mentioned in general, and i think it also holds for c&e, we just have much better visibility into our funnel. and you may have recalled i was talking a lot of -- in prior calls, i talked a lot about a conversation we're having with customers and we knew there was activity, but now that conversation is turning into orders. so, we're feeling much better about the trajectory of the c&e space. historically i've been very cautious to give any real kind of positive trends in this area. but i think we've seen enough over the last few quarters and what we're seeing with our customers and the order book is really the basis for this confidence.
and again, it's tied to not only the pent-up demand they've had in terms of even replacing aged equipment in their laboratories, but they are also -- what we hear from our customers, they are much more confident about where the global economy is going. so, they're willing to make investments. another couple of positives here and there and there will be some ups and downs because of outbreaks here and there of covid, but in general, the trend remains very positive, i think as bob mentioned earlier, our customers have learned to deal with this. so, bob, i know this is -- we've talked a lot about this, anything i missed there?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
okay.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate it, mike. and then on the diagnostic side and just given commentary that you guys are above pre-pandemic levels, can you just talk about the pace of the recovery in the quarter and then expectations for the further ramp from here. and i just want to clarify and make sure you haven't seen any impact in delta up until i guess this week. i just want to make sure i have that clear. thank you.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we saw continued recovery. i think we mentioned at the beginning -- at the end of q2 that we were at pre-pandemic, we exited there. the average was still below. and that steady improvement across our business, across really across all of the regions continued into q3. and by the end of q3, we were above. and patrick, to your specific question about delta, we have not seen any impact to date associated with that.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks, bob.

mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
just on acg, you guys had a pretty impressive operating margin, over 29% for the quarter. i'm just wondering what you feel about the sustainability of those margins and then any progress that you've made on attachment rates in that business? i know you mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but any additional color on that would be helpful.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think i'll pass it on to padraig, who can provide some additional color to the acg and answer your questions. go ahead, padraig.
padraig mcdonnell -- senior vice president, president, agilent crosslab group
yeah. great. thanks, mike. and we're getting back to more normalized service support with our customers, which is more cost associated, of course, with travel, but we're starting to see an accretive margin in q3 and we're seeing that come through to improve in q4. so very, very strong in that. in terms of attach rate, we're seeing increased attach on our services and consumables and of course, with the larger install base, this bodes really well for the future, as more attach rates for services and consumers will be available. so very strong outlook.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey matt, maybe just to build on what padraig is saying in terms of sustainability, we feel very good about the ability to continue to sustain those levels of margin. it gets back to the work that our service engineers do in servicing our customers. it's mission-critical for our customers, keeping those labs and those instruments up. and our ability to continue to invest in digital, as well as, be there on-site on the labs or with the labs is really important. one piece that i would add is we continue to invest in that digital as i mentioned before, and our online orders actually grew faster -- our revenue grew faster than the overall acg business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space. and obviously, that's good for our customers in terms of either doing business with agilent, but it also helps from that margin perspective as well.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for that color, it's very helpful. and then just one more on c&e. i know you've answered a lot of questions already, but i'm just wondering how the competitive landscape might have changed. obviously, it had a challenging time during covid. it took a while for it to recover, and now, it's certainly in recovery mode. i'm just wondering, as you look out of the competitive landscape, have you seen some competitor's slow investment; and therefore, there are some share gain opportunities in that growth that you're seeing?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i don't know where they slowed. i'm not sure they're investing for that segment. so, and we're not seeing much happen on the competitive side. we're by far this is -- we're the clear leader in this space, we've continued to invest in our core portfolio pre and throughout the pandemic. so as you can tell, i'm pretty bullish about our ability to outgrow the competition in this space.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, let me add. it seems like a long time ago, but we have launched two new gcs back in 2019, both at the high end and a mid-range gc. and we talked about one of the reasons that we did that is we've got a leadership position in the gc market. but when you look at it, we're over-indexed to the high-end, and so the ability for us to be able to have this mid -- mid-range, what i think was really critical, and we're starting to see that benefit. and maybe jacob wants to jump in that conversation. yeah.
jacob thaysen -- senior vice president, president life sciences and applied markets group
yeah. exactly. you're actually right, bob, on the gc and our strength in our gc, but i think we should also mention our spectroscopy business and the icp-ms, where we have done a lot of work also icp, oes, and ms, where weve done a lot of work that is -- that has a very strong market share for the material science. and we continue to take market share in that space also. so, i think you'll see us being very strong here. and we have also a site that we will continue to invest into this market going forward. so that's a lot more there for the costumers going forward.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst

your next question is from josh waldman with cleveland research. your line is open.
josh waldman -- cleveland research company -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions, just two for you. mike, you mentioned overall orders outpaced sales in the quarter, and it sounds like book-to-bill in the lsag business was likely positive. just wondered if you could provide us with your assumptions for core growth in the lsag business in the fourth quarter.
and then as we look beyond fy21, given the broad-based strength you've spoken about on the call today, i guess, is it fair to assume that as we look to fy '22, this business should likely grow something above kind of low to mid-single-digit longer-term average?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me talk about the fourth quarter and i'm not sure we're going to answer the last one just yet as we're going through our plan, but...
josh waldman -- cleveland research company -- analyst
had to try.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that was a good try. but i would say for q4, you're accurate in the belief that our book-to-bill was positive for the quarter, and if you think about q4, our guidance comprehends high single-digit, low double-digit growth for the lsag business core growth. and so, i'll leave it at that.
josh waldman -- cleveland research company -- analyst
got it. and then it seems like year-to-date, pharma has outperformed what you expected coming into the year. i just wondered if you could comment on any current thoughts you have around the potential magnitude of any year-end budget flush, i guess, given -- it seems like investments from these customers has -- have been fairly consistent and strong throughout the year. does that deflate any year-end spending?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we'll address that in the q1 call. but to your point, we've been pleasantly surprised, and it has continued to be more stronger than what we've anticipated throughout the first three quarters. and what i would say is we don't expect that to slow down any in q4 either.
josh waldman -- cleveland research company -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and your last question is from jack meehan with nephron research. your line is open.
jack meehan -- nephron research. -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. you talked about the job that your team is doing, managing the supply chain. was wondering if you can elaborate on a hotspot you're seeing in terms of inputs, shipping, or labor. and when you look at the fourth-quarter guidance, is that -- are you taking any more prudent or conservative type approach based on what's going on in the supply chains?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i mean, this has been a lot of discussion on that. i think everybody is talking about the supply chain constraints on a global basis. it's been a challenge for us, but as bob noted in this call script, our team has just done a tremendous job getting the agilent products to our customers. and we're really good at this about managing situations. so, we will work on a number of commodity areas for some time. and we also have done things as identifying a chain in alternatives source supply, so we've been able to do that.
we've had a last-minute changes to notification from logistics suppliers that they won't pick up our boxes, and so we switched to another supplier.
so, we've been able to manage our way through that. and it was conspicuous, it was absent in our call script a lot of details because while we continue to monitor it, we don't believe theres a material risk to the company at this time, and we still likely factored all that into our guide for the fourth quarter. and bob, i know that you've done a close study of this as well, anything else you'd add to that?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. the only thing i would say is it's the usual suspects that other folks have called out, things like resins and chips and our team has done to date an outstanding job of being able to continue to satisfy demand here.
and our expectation is that that's going to continue to happen into q4. and we've got a continuous improvement program that continues to drive productivity and efficiency gains and we're expecting that to combat some of these inflationary pressures as well as continuing to deliver to our customers and we will continue to do that into '22 as well.
jack meehan -- nephron research. -- analyst
great. and then one other follow-up is on covid.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
jack meehan -- nephron research. -- analyst
so, the fourth-quarter guidance assumes it's a 1-point headwind, though we're obviously in the middle of another delta wave here. so, i was curious what you're seeing on the ground or whether your products are just starting to wane in general and any preliminary thoughts around how, you have 100 million this year, just how you're going to guide as you go into 2022 related to that?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. what i would say, jack, it's a good question. and our products are directly tied to the testing. we didn't see the dramatic increase, but also didn't see the dramatic decline with the testing there. ours is more around expanding capacity both in, in testing and over this course of this last year, we've actually seen it migrate to more therapeutic capacity or excuse me, vaccine capacity in demand there. and so, we don't see it spiking up or not building that into q4. i think it's a little too early to tell for fy22. it's been reasonably steady the last couple of quarters and we do expect contribution in '22 and we'll provide more color as we get through our planning process, but we don't see it dramatically dropping off.
jack meehan -- nephron research. -- analyst
sounds good. thanks, bob.
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah.
operator
i do apologize. but we do have an additional question, the last question is from dan arias with stifel. your line is open.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. hi, guys. thanks for getting me in here at the end. hi, mike?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
no problem.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
just one for me. just bob, maybe a high-level question. just sort of to the idea of getting to a post-covid world whenever that might be. i'm wondering which of the three segments you think might stand the best chance of maybe rebasing at a higher level of the up-margin line, just by virtue of some of the success that you're having, and then to your point, some of the fundamental changes that might come to the expense structure. is that something you think is possible? and if so, would you be willing to help us with which one is looking most promising there?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
i do think it's possible. i'm not going to call out because i'm not going to let -- if i call out one, i'm not going to let the other two division presidents off the hook. they must have paid you. i think we could continue to do it across the board. certainly, we are making investments across all three of the businesses to continue to grow. but we certainly feel like we have opportunities to continue to drive margin enhancement across all three of our business groups. sorry guys.
dan arias -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thanks so much.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.

mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, parmeet, and welcome to your first agilent's earnings call as our new vice president of investor relations. and thanks everyone for joining our call today.
before covering our third quarter financial results, i want to acknowledge the recent passing of dr. tachi yamada, a giant in our industry and a former agilent board member. tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved agilent board member for nine years. as many of you on the call already know, tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others. i know that the agilent team is not alone and recognize that tachi yamada will be greatly missed and we extend our deepest sympathies to tachi's family.
now, on to the third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year. in q3, the very strong broad based momentum in our business continues. the agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. q3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. this is against the mass decline of 3% in q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. in addition, as other positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. our growth is broad based across all business groups, markets and geographies. the combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share. our q3 operating margin is 26%, this is up 230 basis points from last year.
eps is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. agilent's success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess. we are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability. since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure agilent emerged even stronger as a company. while we have yet to leave covid-19 in the rearview mirror, our q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results.
bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but i want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, pharma and chemical energy. we continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid 20s just a few years ago. in chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. this is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half and our order funnel continues to strengthen.
looking at our performance by business unit, the life sciences and applied markets group generated revenue of $680 million. lsag is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core, off just a 4% decline last year. lsag's growth is broad based across all end markets. our performance is led by strength in pharma, which is up 22% and chemical energy up 31%. all businesses delivered strong growth led by cell analysis at 38% growth and our lc and lcms businesses, which grew 22%. we continue to strengthen our position in the fast growing large molecule market segment. during the quarter, the lsag team launched three infinitylab bio lc systems at the well attended infinitylab lc virtual conference in june. these new products further extend our lc leadership position.
in addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance ready lc/q-tof and lc/tof solution to our portfolio in the quarter. the agilent crosslab group posted revenue of $560 million, this is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. these results are on top of 1% growth last year. the business is benefiting from increased activity and customer labs and instrument connect rates. this is leading to more contracted services, on-demand services and consumables consumption across all end markets. all end markets grew mid teens or higher with the exception of environmental and forensics, but still grew 9%.
the pandemic has shown acg to be our most durable business, with acg grown each quarter since covid-19 first emerged. our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends. looking forward, instrument placements and demand bode well with continued strong performance by acg as we drive attachment rates and increased customer lifetime value.
the diagnostics and genomics group produced revenue of $346 million, up 44% reported and up 37% core, compared to an 8% decline last year. the growth was broad based across product lines and regions and was led by our nasd gmp oligo business. the ramp of our facility in frederick, colorado continues to go very well. the quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily surpassing the $30 million revenue milestone, while one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing the output in a high quality manner. this gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate of revenue with existing capacity.
in addition, the train b manufacturing line expansion is well underway and on schedule. our genomics instrumentation and consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter as did our pathology-related businesses. for the first time in several quarters, we saw a diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. while we are watching delta variant very closely, to date we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes.
i also want to highlight our performance in china. while still less than 10% of dgg revenue, our china business grew 50% in the quarter. we continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger china market position. in q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a china based biopharma company. earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our sureselect product line. we are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in china for our dgg product and services offerings.
in addition, the integration of resolution bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast growing ngs based cancer diagnostic market. it was a busy quarter at agilent. so, i have a few other achievements i'd like to share with you. last month, we published agilent's 21st annual corporate social responsibility report. at a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a company. we've been addressing these issues since our founding more than two decades ago. i would encourage you to review our report on the agilent website.
we're also very pleased to receive recognition of the great place to work in united states by the great place to work institute. this result is just one more example of agilent having a highly engaged and energized team, and as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. looking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be an outstanding fiscal year 2021. as a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. i will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth and earnings generation. while the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, agilent is well positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. i remain very proud of the agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders.
thank you for being on the call today and look forward to your questions. i will now hand the call off to bob. bob?
robert w. mcmahon -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon everyone. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional details on q3 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
as mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the third quarter. revenue was $1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%, core revenue growth was 21%. currency added 4.5% for the quarter and m&a added 0.5 point. in addition, covid-related revenues were in line with the prior year. all end markets performed well with pharma and chemical and energy as standouts versus our expectations. our largest market pharma grew 27% during the quarter, after growing 2% last year. the performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business growing 52%, while our small molecule business grew mid teens, and all regions in the pharma market grew double-digits.
our large molecule business was driven by our nasd division and demand for lc and mass spec instrumentation and solutions, while our small molecule business was primarily driven by qa-qc refresh. chemical and energy also performed well this quarter with 23% growth. even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. this result was driven by increasing momentum in demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. our view is that the chemical and energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward.
the diagnostics and clinical market grew 28% against the decline of 10% a year ago, our softest quarter last year. we are very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth. on a regional basis, all regions grew with china up 41% and americas delivering 38% growth. in the academia and government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. on a regional basis, europe led the way. the food market continued its double-digit performance growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity.
a developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the u.s. also contributed to growth in this market and regionally the food market was led by the americas and europe. rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth. on a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the americas at 32% and europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. the performance was broad-based across all markets. and as expected, china was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. all three business groups grew in china during the quarter. pharma, chemical and energy and diagnostics were the key drivers.
now turning to the rest of the p&l, third-quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 80 basis points from a year ago despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency. our strong top line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team drove the year-on-year improvement. and our supply team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers, despite the increase in demand. gross margin improvement -- performance along with continued operating expense leverage resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. putting it all together, we delivered eps of $1.10, up 41% versus last year. our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 306 million shares, as expected.
we delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year while crossing the $1 billion mark in nine months. during the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. accounting for our q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. we are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of $6.29 billion to $6.32 billion, up $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4% and core growth of 14.5% to 15%. included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from m&a.
in addition, we are on track to deliver roughly $100 million in covid-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. we expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-gaap eps to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year. this translates the fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion. this represents reported growth of 10% to 12% and core growth of 8.5% to 10% on top of the 6% growth in q4 of last year when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns.
in addition, while covid revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high watermark in our covid related revenue. and as a result, we expect to see roughly a one point headwind due to covid revenue in the quarter. so, our core growth excluding covid would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. we are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. non-gaap eps is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%.
now, before opening the call for questions, i want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses and expect to close the year extremely well. we believe our strategy is the right ones for agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results weve been producing without the excellent execution by the team.
with that parmeet, back to you for q&a.
parmeet ahuja -- vice president, investor relations

of course. [operator instructions] our first question for the call today comes from tycho peterson from j.p. morgan. tycho, your line is open.
rachel olson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. hi. this is rachel on for tycho. thanks for taking my questions.
so first off, great to hear about companion diagnostic package for fda review. so can you just give us the expected timeline for when you think you'll get that back? and if anything is expected in contribution for this guide for '22?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
rachel, thanks for that question. i'm going to pass it over to sam.
sam raha -- president of the agilent diagnostics and genomics group
yeah, rachel, thank you very much for the question. we are very excited about having completed all the modules and made the submission for the companion diagnostic related to mirati's adagrasib. as you know now, we have done what we need to and we'll engage with the fda as they come back with questions. we can't, we don't exactly -- are able to control the timeline.
and as you likely know, the actual approval would be very much tied to the approval of the drug itself, which, of course, we have no control over either. but we are very excited about the progress.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i would say to the following question.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think bob had to build on that.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. just to build on that, as was recently disclosed, the pdufa date is scheduled for the end of this fiscal -- calendar year. so there's not any material revenue associated with this built into our fiscal year guide, but we're very excited about the opportunity in 2023 and beyond.
rachel olson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
noted. and then for the acea guide, can you just give us a rundown on the updated outlook by end market for what's assumed in the new guide?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
for the full year or second quarter, rachel?
rachel olson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
both would actually be great.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i going to let the witness. so i think very similar to what we had talked about at the very beginning of the year. the two strongest markets will continue to be our pharma and chemical and energy market. i think as we look at those, certainly, both of them performed better than we expected in q1.
and our expectation is that those will continue to be the driver of growth for the full year with pharma probably at a roughly double-digit growth and chemical and energy about that high single-digit, double-digit growth as well. and then followed very closely by diagnostics in -- at high single digits. and then food, environmental and academia, and government are probably in the low to mid-single digits, which is pretty consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. and it's slightly different, but same directional for q2 with pharma probably being a little stronger.
rachel olson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and then for chemical and energy, can you just talk about if you see any risk coming from russia and ukraine? and then also, if you could just touch on that decline of 11% this quarter in environmental. how much of a headwind with covid for that segment? or is there anything else underlying in that market that's really changed relative to your prior expectation?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would say for chemical and energy, as you know, i mean, our business is really globally based. and so as of right now, we don't see any material impact to the chemical and energy market or our forecast going forward. obviously, we're watching that closely.
and then i think for environmental and forensics, it's our smallest market and can be lumpy. there was some impact associated with chinese or lunar new year in china. but we haven't seen any impact there. what i would say is we are starting to see some of the disbursements more in our order funnel than in revenue associated with the infrastructure initial bill here in the united states.
so i wouldn't read anything into it in terms of changing in fundamental demand.
rachel olson -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. 
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
you're welcome. 
operator
our next question today comes from matthew sykes from goldman sachs. matthew, your line is open. 
dave delahunt -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hi. this is dave on for matt. it was great to see the strength in biopharma end market. given the challenging funding market for these biotech firms.
any additional color you can give on what you're seeing in the biotech end market and productivity there?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, yeah, dave. first of all, thanks for the recognition. we're really pleased with that 32% growth print, and we see the underlying demand remaining strong. and bob, i think it's fair to say we haven't necessarily seen any impact at all from what maybe happened in the biotech funding arena.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we are very excited about our portfolio and how it plays into that space and are believing that that strong growth will continue going forward.
dave delahunt -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fantastic. and any additional color on the drivers of the strong margin expansion in lsag? and how sustainable is this margin expansion over the rest of the year?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll jump in there. yes, the team has done a fantastic job really driving margin. and if we look at it, it's a combination of being able to cover our costs from the standpoint of the increased logistics and material costs, as well as very strong management discipline in the operating expenses. so it's a combination of being successful in our price, which we had talked about before, and covering those costs, as well as being able to leverage kind of our infrastructure across all three of the groups.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and bob, i think you also called out the digital investments we're making. so that's in particular showing up through the sg&a line as we leverage digital investments.
dave delahunt -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fantastic. congrats on the quarter, guys. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. you're welcome, dave. 
operator
our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. vijay, please go ahead.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on a nice quarter here, and thanks for taking my question. bob, maybe one near-term question here on the second quarter guide. the 200 basis points range, that's wider than your normal -- typical range, your annual guidance range is 100 basis points.
any reason for a wider branch and it comes to it really hard in 2q. so i'm curious, what's giving you the confidence to get to that upper end of 8.5%, which would imply sequentially flattish with 1q trends?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me take the second part first. as mike mentioned in the call, our demand continues to be very strong, and we actually had order growth that exceeded revenue growth almost two times. and that gives us confidence around the order book going into q2 really across multiple end markets.
and so that gives us the ability to deliver the -- or expected to deliver the high growth in q2. in regards to the range, there are still uncertainties out there. as omicron continues to impact mainly asia right now and then some other uncertainties. so i think that's just taking a little wider lens, but we still feel good about the business for the full year.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i appreciate the recognition, i think, bob, what we posted 19% core last year.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
so i appreciate that recognition, vijay. and as bob mentioned, the book of business is really quite strong, plus also our services business is really strong diagnostics. so the recurring revenue side of the house is quite strong.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, mike. and maybe on the comment on the acquisition contribution here in the second quarter, it seems to be sequentially down. is there any seasonality to that business? and what is the guide assuming for -- you didn't note the strong order book for 2q? is the guide assuming perhaps their order book momentum tapers down in the back half?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no, it doesn't. there is an element of getting tougher comps, but the momentum continues. i would say for q2, it's more timing than anything else relative to the m&a.
it is down slightly sequentially, but i would say in the overall scheme of things, not material.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome. 
operator
next, we have a question from brandon couillard from jefferies. brandon, your line is open. 
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. mike, on the ai acquisition, it sounds interesting. it's definitely a buzzword. would you expect to be making incremental investments with this deal? and could you just comment on how and why the ai tools are kind of used in the instrumentation today and when you sort of expect this to be, i guess, more of a reality of feature?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, brandon, happy to do so. i'm going to actually invite jacob on the response here because, yes, we hear a lot about the buzzwords. and when the team first came to be and started talking about this opportunity, we said, well, in actuality, there's a lot more than buzzwords here. we actually have some lighthouse customers using this capability already.
and as you hear from jacob, it really drives productivity for those high-volume labs. so we think for certain segments of the market, this is actually going to be a reality. and jacob, why don't you build on my comments there, if you don't mind?
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yes, sure. thanks for the question here, brandon, i'm very excited about this also on bringing the best control team here into agilent. it might be a buzzword, but we have really seen that it really makes a difference. and first of all, it fits very well into an informatic strategy, where we're all about digitalizing the lab and create that detail inside both scientifically and productivity-wise for our customers.
here, the first product realization, which has already been prototype, we're aiming to what a part of the -- that is very prone for ai right now. and that is really the manual interpretation of commercial graft, as mike also mentioned. usually, labs are spending a highly trained chemist to go out and do manual peak integration, which is a tedious process. and you can imagine if you have a high-volume lab, there's a lot of investment going into this area.
an active virtual control here have already proven with the customers that they can take a substantial part of that work and actually automate that. so we're very glad about that. we're going after the pcms business first. we have a substantial installed base and we actually believe that we can implement this here in the second part of fiscal '22.
now long term, we do believe there's a great opportunity to provide those algorithms also across our analytical platforms and also for other applications like qc release and predictive maintenance and all things. so even though it's the buzzword, there is a lot of real products behind this, and i'm very excited about it. mike?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jacob.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
just one follow-up for bob. just if you could just elaborate a little bit more about the book-to-bill in the first quarter and then a couple just housekeeping was the move of the year impact kind of in line with the plan. and i think last quarter, you talked about $15 million of kind of delayed orders. were all those recouped in the first quarter? just kind of an update on that.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
brandon, as usual, your notes are quite accurate. and so let me address a couple of those things. so the lunar new year impact came in kind of as we anticipated, which should come back into q2. that transit time or that $15 million that came in, but we haven't seen really the improvement.
so there's still opportunities in the second half of this year. our end of the quarter coincided with the large snowstorm in the u.s., but the shipments were out and we still were able to deliver. in terms of -- the first question was about lunar -- i'm thinking sitting on both. i think on both.
brandon, did we miss something?
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
just if you could quantify the book to bill, if you're early.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
oh, yes. quantify the book to bill. yes. i knew that there was something else.
i was trying to avoid that one on purpose because we're not going to provide that. but what i can tell you is that the growth rate of our orders was twice as much as the revenue growth, and i would say our backlog is the highest it's ever been.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and brandon, this is mike. i would just add one comment. there was one word in my script. i really wanted to make sure that i emphasize here throughout the quarter.
so this wasn't just a calendar december year-end kind of story, we saw this order strength throughout the entirety of our fiscal q1.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from puneet souda from svb leerink. puneet, your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
mike and bob, thanks for taking the question. so. the first one is just a follow-up on the order book. wondering if you can quantify that? obviously, that's been growing strongly.
and maybe just help us understand, once that you have the strong order book, you have confidence in the rest of -- i mean, the guide throughout the year based on what you're providing. but maybe just talk to us about the sort of the cadence wise in terms of supply chains. obviously, we're hearing -- we have a number of questions that we get on supply chains frequently. so just wondering what's your level of confidence on the supply chain and turning those order books into orders?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, i'd say that the supply chain environment continues to be quite challenging. on the other hand, i remain quite confident because our team has found ways to continue to navigate through those and meeting the expectations of customer terms to delivery times. in fact, if i recall correctly, our order cancellation was actually lower this year than prior year.
so while i don't want to imply that it's all sunny out there in terms of the supply chain, we've been working on this thing for a while. i mean many quarters ago, we were working on this quarter and the second half of this year. so while the environment remains challenged externally, i remain confident in our ability to actually get product to customers when they need it.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and pardon me, to your -- puneet, to your first question, on the quantification. we're not going to provide that other than what i had answered.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
there's that one, bob. but we did find the two times order growth rate versus revenue.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. fair. and in terms of cell analysis, mike, i mean, that franchise has been growing. you highlighted lonza, the cocoon platform, a couple of other capabilities.
maybe can you -- i know at one point, you had sort of quantified that business. i'm wondering if you can do that again. and what sort of growth rates you're seeing there? and what's the expectation this year given the acceleration you're seeing in overall in biomolecules? thank you.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for that question. we love to talk about the cell analysis. it's been a really great addition to the company over the years, and we continue to grow and expand that.
so first of all, i'd say that business remains to be very healthy. we're seeing really good strong end-market demand. and bob, i think for the year, we're expecting the double-digit growth out of cell analysis business. and really excited the fact that in addition to the manufacturing expansion of heightened chicopee, that kind of gives you an indication of our confidence in future growth.
and i believe we're close to bob and jacob close north of $400 million for this business this year?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
this year, yes.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. super helpful, guys. all right. thank you. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
puneet, you're welcome. 
operator
our next question comes from patrick donnelly from citi. patrick, your line is open.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the questions. guys. mike, maybe one on china. between the tough comp eluded year, obviously, a few layers there.
can you just talk about, i guess, the core performance is going to stripping that out a little bit, what you're seeing there, what you saw through to your point there throughout the quarter, i guess the cadence, and then the expectations going forward there as well, just between the different markets there. just curious what's going on.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's interesting. sometimes you can get kind of diverted on the headlines out of china because our business remains quite strong. and we're seeing good strength in pharma.
it's really been a key driver for us, which bob highlighted in the script. but also our diagnostics business, dgg grew, i think, over 40% in the first quarter, services growth in the mid-teens. so other things that i've talked to you about, which is in addition to continuing to grow and strengthen our instrumentation portfolio market share in china. we've also been talking about our ability to grow our acg business in china with that large installed base.
and the fact that we've historically viewed ourselves of being underpenetrated in diagnostic and genomics, and we're really starting to see traction on both of those growth factors. so again, we feel really confident about the state of the china business because the amount of order book we have, but also these other areas of recurring revenue are really growing, growing well for us. and we continue to invest for our customers in china, as i mentioned in my call script. so i think there's a lot to like about the opportunities in our business in china.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. patrick, just one other thing, while we grew 3% as we mentioned, if we add back in kind of the lunar new year estimate, it was high single digits, which was in our -- in line with what we had expected. and our expectation is that that's going to be for the full year as well. now q2 will be stronger than that, obviously, as it comes back, and we also saw mid-teen, mid- to high teens growth in orders in q1.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then maybe just on the academic and government market. you're not alone, obviously calling that out as being a little sluggish to come back.
maybe just what you saw there in january, mike, i know you called out the remote learning maybe caused a little more of a pause even as we go into '22. and then just expectations there going forward, you expect the market to kind of normalize a little bit. and what are you hearing from customers on that front?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks for that, patrick. we see the omicron impact as transitory. and we saw that in the u.s., for example, and we'd expect to -- i think bobby called out in the script back to normal kind of levels in february.
so we actually expect the environment to improve over the year. i think we are flattish for q1. but bob, i think we're calling for mid-singles-or-so growth for the full year. so that would imply a pickup in growth in this segment later on this year.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, for everything that we see, patrick, funding levels continue in activity within our order book continues to be strong. so not as strong obviously as the pharma and c&e areas, which are leading the growth in the diagnostics. but we're not seeing any fundamentally different performance in that market going forward.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you, guys. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.

up next, we have a question from jack meehan from nephron research. jack, your line is open.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, guys. i was hoping you could elaborate on the pricing actions you're taking in the market? how do they compare to kind of normal periods? and what areas of the portfolio have you had success when it comes to pricing? 
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that, jack. and i think we mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were estimating roughly a point of growth associated with that was about half of what we had seen normally to cover the increased costs. and what i would say is through q1, we're ahead of schedule, which is good.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
ok. and then the other area i was hoping you had an update on is nasd. so over 45% growth in the quarter. maybe just any update to what your guidance is for the full year? it seems like you're tracking ahead of schedule here.
and just when the new line opens up, just what sort of pace you expect to be able to take advantage of that capacity?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i was going to say, we -- the team continues to do a fantastic job and continues to drive even more revenue and product out of the existing capacity. and it was a great first quarter and slightly ahead of our expectations. we had expected double-digit growth, and that continues to be our expectation before the new train, train b comes online at the end of this calendar year.
and the order book continues to be strong. that team continues to actually build the order book for '23, in building that demand for that train. so we are extremely excited about that business and are looking forward to not only bringing that up, but also looking for other ways to expand our capacity.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you, bob.
operator
our next question comes from derik de bruin from bank of america. derik, please go ahead. 
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. this is mike on for derik. i want to ask a little bit on the diagnostics and the clinical end markets. in particular, you called out sort of the expansion of lc/ms into some of the applications here and you're seeing a new vector of clinical growth here.
i was wondering if you could elaborate on that. just sort of what are the specific drivers you're seeing there and where some of that uptick happening.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question. i'm going to pass it over to jacob for some more details here. but also, i would also just remind, we also had a very good print on the pathology side of our diagnostics business.
but i think you'll hear from jacob, lc/ms is an indication of some future traction, we're already getting some good growth. so jacob, your thoughts there?
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah, absolutely. we have closed the year have a good lc/ms clinical business in the u.s. but over the past year, we have also expanded ourselves into china, really good tractions. we both have our own product line there, our direct sales, but we also have an oem partner.
so in that sense, we are both addressing the customers that we know, but also a lot of customers that we want to get access to. and that's been quite successful. and hence, we are right now looking to expand the portfolio even further. we have the ultivo, of course, with our lp connected, and we're looking to other parts of our portfolio, both within lc/ms but also beyond lc/ms here over the next period of time.
but we do see china as a great opportunity. but here over the next period of time, we will also enter into other areas like europe and other places.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and, jacob, on the ultivo, i think the customers love the combination of performance and the size of the footprint really fits nicely into the diagnostic lab.
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yes, exactly. we spent a lot of energy of both making it a size that fits very well into the lc stack. but more than that, we also made it more easy to work with. so it's actually an ease-of-use solution.
so we're very excited about that and even better the customers are also super excited about that. i do want to mention also that we also have a strong clinical business within the flow cytometry. with the ultivo business, and that continues to drive growth and particularly china, where we see a lot of demand there also. as you might recall, the flow cytometry from the ultivo business is really focused on decentralized lab also again with ease of use, and we see a lot of interest in that.
and i do expect also that u.s. will be a future market for us here.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. any color you can give us just real quick on sort of how meaningful lc/ms is within that 15% of your exposure? is it just to give us a sense of the scale of that relative to genomics and cancer diagnostics and pathology things like that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob, do you want to take it or do you want me to?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, yeah. i'll take it. it's -- it is still relatively small but growing very fast, which the market itself is quite large. and so the opportunity here is really in front of us going forward.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and if i could ask a quick follow-up on -- just on the capital deployment side and on m&a. obviously, you've done some smaller deals in the last couple of years, and you continue to invest in technologies and you've got some -- you've had m&a deployed into sort of life science solutions and cell analysis, you've had things in liquid biopsy and now artificial intelligence. so it's kind of showcase that you can deploy capital in a variety of different end markets.
but just looking at where the balance sheet is now? any thought on larger acquisitions and sort of scaling up to do a bigger deal? and what excites you? what markets would you be looking to? what sort of how would you go about setting to deploy that capital?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. happy to address that, mike. so i appreciate, by the way, the recognition of the variety of where we deploy capital. but there's a consistent theme across where we deploy capital, which is high-growth end markets, which will drive increase to the overall core growth of the company in places where we can leverage the scale and the capabilities we have in the company to really make those businesses even more successful.
so i think there's a timing kind of an underlying theme behind all those acquisitions. so that would continue to be our thesis and our approach, as well as staying focused in the private sector, which we think there's -- really fits well the agilent model and often, the potential acquired companies and leadership teams really find the ad and culture, a good place to be. and they also see how well we've done with previous acquisitions. so we've got a track record as well that they can point to.
and i'm on record saying that we wanted to deploy our balance sheet as part of our overall growth story. it's part of what we've been calling our build and buy growth strategy. and as you may know, the largest deal that we've done to date has been -- was the acquisition of biotek, but we believe we can do multiples of that deal and be willing to deploy capital if the right opportunity comes along for us. 
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks.

our next question comes from thomas peterson from baird. thomas, your line is open.
thomas peterson -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. 
thomas peterson -- baird -- analyst
just wanted to circle back on pharma. and just wanted to know if you had seen any benefit within pharma from both onshoring activities and manufacturing redundancies and kind of, if so, where has this tailwind been? and what are your expectations for any potential durability here?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
great question. so i think this is actually a story both for the pharma, as well as elements of our chemical and energy business. and i'd say right now, not yet material in terms of order book or revenue, but we believe it's coming. there's a lot of discussions with customers that are building new capacity.
i would say it's probably more of a '23 kind of event. but i think it speaks to the durability of growth that we think we have in agilent's two largest end markets. so we're hearing lots of discussions about dual sources of critical components, onshoring of previously offshore critical supply chain elements. so i think the continued supply chain challenges that the world is seeing is only putting more emphasis on that direction.
so i'd say right now, it's in the longer-term planning phase. as you know, the analytical laboratory instrumentation is often the last thing that's added when they bring on new capacity, but we believe it's coming, but it's not been material yet to the company's performance. 
thomas peterson -- baird -- analyst
great. that's super helpful. and maybe just to finish for me. just any updated thoughts on the one agilent commercial organization transition? anything that surprised you relative to expectations, sort of how is that incorporation gone internally?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'm going to have padraig jump in here with some additional specifics. as you know, i've asked padraig to take on this role in addition to his leading the overall agilent services business. but we're just delighted with the start of this new structure.
and i think i always say the proofs in the results, and we're off to a good start with the fact that we had such a strong q1 order book throughout the quarter. and padraig, i know it's been just a few months where you've been pulling your team together and -- but i think you're already starting to work with customers differently. and maybe you could share some of your thoughts here.
padraig mcdonnell -- president of the agilent crosslab group
yes. thanks, mike. i think we're starting to see the benefit of an enterprise approach to both sales and service and the associated functions and of course, selling the complete agilent solution to customers, which includes instruments, services, and consumers with aligned sales approach is really giving us a lot of scale with customers. what we're also seeing a doubling down on our investments in our digital interaction with customers, and we continue to see strong momentum with accelerating digital growth of about 25%.
so great start, mike, and more to come.

our next question comes from dan brennan from cowen. dan, your line is open.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, mike and bob. thanks for taking my question, and congrats. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
i was going to go back to c&e. mike, could you or bob unpack -- kind of unpack the customers there, chemical r&m, just kind of give us a flavor for what you're seeing? and i know the question was asked earlier about the impact of what's going on. but just wondering, as oil price spikes in the past, kind of what kind of impact have you seen if the oil price spike is sustained?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'd say if you look at the three subsegments of the c&e marketplace, we often talk about the chemicals, energy, and advanced materials market. i think it's the chemicals and advanced materials market segments that are driving the growth here. now theoretically, when -- although be it now much -- it's a very small part of the total number these days.
higher oil prices would tend to lead to more investment in that energy segment portion of the whole market segment. but i can't remember the exact percentage. i know it's evolved a bit over time. but i think what's most interest to us is how does the world view global growth were pmi.
so yes, i think the highest correlation of growth in this segment relate to pmi and the global growth outlook. but we would -- there could be some more money to invest in exploration, perhaps if oil prices stay high, but it's really also really driven by the pmi view. that's why they still remain positive and that's why we're optimistic about our ability to grow this overall market throughout the rest of this year.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, dan, to build on what mike was saying, if we looked at those three big areas, over 90% -- or roughly 90% of our c&e business is actually chemicals and advanced materials. and so the energy piece is an important component, but that demand around new types of chemicals, advanced materials, and so forth is really what's driving it. and so whether it'd be batteries and other areas around these is the growth driver today.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. got it. thanks. and then just related to the oligo business, the nasd business.
just can you remind us, at least from the perspective of like within your high single-digit growth for pharma, kind of how many points of growth should we be thinking that business is contributing?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
pharma, it grew -- it was roughly 2 to 3 points of growth for pharma in q1.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then for the year, sorry? yes, yes. sorry about, mike. i misspoke. so for the year, i think you're talking low double now for pharma.
so what's assumed from the oligo business within that low double?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
1 point or 2.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think the message here is the pharma growth was strong for the biopharma and asd, but also across the rest of the company's portfolio as well. so it's an agilentwide story.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. and then maybe just one final one to sneak in. just the lc market. mike, it's always interesting to hear what's going on and that's a big part of your business, what the competitive trends there like in lc?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
all i can tell you about is what's going on in my business, which is it's doing very well. so we've got -- we had -- we continue to see very strong business momentum. the market demand is very robust. you may -- if i recall in my script, i tried to call out demand in our chromatography systems remains very robust.
we saw double-digit growth again in q2 -- q1 '22 off double digit over the prior year, backlog strong, orders growing faster than revenue. so there's a lot to like about what's going on with the lc business.
dan brennan -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.

our next question comes from paul knight from keybanc. paul, your line is open.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
it's always tough to ask a good question late in the day, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
come on, paul, i know you're up to it. i know you're up to it.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
as i look at the 32% biotechnology growth, which seems extraordinarily good, would you attribute this to the cell and gene therapy market and specifically biotech instruments? what's behind that really high growth rate?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
bob, why don't we tag team on this, but i'd say it's really being driven by not only the nasd business we talked about earlier, but our core lc/ms business. i mean there is some contribution from cell and gene therapy, but it really is coming from the lc/ms business, along with really strong growth of services and consumables as well. so i'd say it's really a broad-based story, but really around our core instrumentation platforms, along with services and consumables.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, spot-on.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and then goes for that. sorry, paul.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
sorry. you've mentioned lc/ms more than, i think is typical. is this a result of -- are you seeing a result of benefit yet from the avantor jv. and in addition, i know crosslab, you mentioned higher connectivity.
i think you're implying you continue to gain some share there. if you can talk to those two topics.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, happy to. acg has been what we're doing has been near and dear to our overall growth strategy for a number of years. and we're very excited about the new relationship we have with avantor. i'd say it's still very early days.
so not yet a material contributor to the top-line revenue. and that really was all -- so it's proceeding according to plan. so i'd say there's more to come in that regards. and then on the connect rate, yes, in fact, we called that out on purpose to say we continue to see higher connect rates with our consumables and services business, and we think that bodes well for future growth.
and padraig, maybe you want to just comment a bit on what you're seeing on the services side on the connect rate.
padraig mcdonnell -- president of the agilent crosslab group
yeah. well, overall, the attach rate for both service and consumables in the high 20s, but we believe and we have significant headroom for growth going forward as we target into higher technology spaces. and on the services side, in particular, we have a strong demand for contracts, and that's driving a lot of connect rate with new instruments as well, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i think we had double-digit contract growth and probably more than 10% of agile's revenues is now under service contracts.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst

hello, and welcome to the q1 2022 agilent technologies earnings conference call. my name is emily, and i will be coordinating the call today. [operator instructions] i now have the pleasure of handing the call over to our host, parmeet ahuja, vice president, investor relations at agilent technologies. please go ahead.
parmeet ahuja -- vice president, investor relations
thank you emily, and welcome everyone to agilent's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. with me are mike mcmullen, agilent president and ceo, and bob mcmahon, agilent senior vice president and cfo. joining in the q&a after mike and bob's comments will be jacob thaysen, president of the agilent life science and applied markets group; sam raha, president of the agilent diagnostics and genomics group; and padraig mcdonnell, president of the agilent crosslab group. this presentation is being webcast live.
the news release for our q1 financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with a recording of this webcast, are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. today's comments by mike and bob will refer to non-gaap financial measures. you'll find the most directly comparable gaap financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year over year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis.
core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. guidance is based on exchange rates as of january 31. as previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. we have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes.
these changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. the company assumes no obligation to update them.
please look at the company's recent sec filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. and now, i'd like to turn the call over to mike. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, parmeet, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. our momentum continues. the agilent team delivered a strong start to 2022 in q1, exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line. our q1 revenues are $1.67 billion.
this is up 9% core and up 8% reported. this is on top of growing 11% core in q1 a year ago. excluding covid-19-related revenues, our core growth is even better at 10% this quarter. we continued to see strength in our order book with robust order in-take throughout the quarter.
in fact, q1 orders grew roughly twice as fast as revenues. q1 operating margins are a healthy 26.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. earnings per share of $1.21 are up 14%. the eps increase is versus a tough comparison of 31% growth in the first quarter of 2021.
these strong results have been achieved in a very dynamic environment. i could not be more proud of the agilent team's ability to execute and deliver. let's take a closer look at some of what's driving our strong results. bob will go into more details later in the call, but our two largest markets continue strong double-digit growth.
our pharma business, agilent's largest market, continues to lead the way for us, growing 17%. global end-market demand for our products and services remains very strong. biopharma grew 32% while small molecule growth came in at a robust 9%. the momentum in our chemical and energy business also continues, delivering 15% growth in the quarter.
this was driven by mid-teens revenue increases in chemicals and advanced materials. pmi's remain positive, along with our overall outlook in the chemicals, energy, and advanced materials markets. on a geographic basis, our results were led by 13% growth in the americas. this is on top of 13% growth in q1 a year ago.
china grew 3% on top of 25% growth in q1 of last year and was impacted by the timing of lunar new year as noted in our november call. demand in china remains strong as orders grew high teens in the first quarter. we continue to invest in china for china, to further strengthen our ability to serve our customers. we recently announced a $20 million expansion of our shanghai manufacturing center to meet growing demand for our locally made liquid chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass spec systems.
looking at our performance by business unit, the life sciences and applied markets group generated revenue of $976 million, an increase of 7% on a core basis. this is versus a 10% core growth in q1 of 2021. lsag's growth was led by strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. from a platform perspective, customer interest in, and purchases of our chromatography systems and mass spec offerings are very robust.
our chemistries and supplies business, which moved over from acg this year, continues to do very well, delivering double-digit growth. we also continue to invest and strategically partner for future growth. late last week, we announced the acquisition of very exciting artificial intelligence technology that will be integrated into our industry-leading chromatography businesses. this technology has the potential to significantly improve lab productivity and accuracy by automating manual interpretation of chromatography data.
we believe that this capability will be very well received by the high-throughput labs agilent serves around the world. this acquisition is an example of our build and buy growth strategy, as it complements the work our internal r&d teams are doing to develop these types of capabilities for other agilent platforms. during the quarter, we also announced a partnership with lonza to integrate agilent's analytics technologies and techniques into lonza's cocoon platform cell therapy manufacturing workflow. the collaboration has the potential to transform the way personalized cell therapies are manufactured.
in addition, to ensure we can meet the strong and growing demand for our cell analysis offerings, we also recently announced plans to invest more than $30 million for the construction of a new manufacturing site in chicopee, massachusetts. the agilent crosslab group posted services revenue of $359 million. this is up 10% core against a 11% q1 2021 core growth compare. this growth is broad-based with strength in service contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services.
our focus on providing a differentiated customer experience that leverages our large-scale and talented customer support team continues to pay off. our connect rates continue to improve and our installed base continues to expand, both boding well for continued strength in our services business. the diagnostics and genomics group delivered revenue of $339 million, up 14% core versus q1 '21 core growth of 15%. our excellent growth is broad-based across pathology, genomics, and nasd.
our pathology business grew roughly 10% with strength across all regions. our core genomics business grew low teens, with strength in target enrichment and our genomics quality control product lines. the nasd team continues to deliver, driving 45% plus, growth in the quarter. meanwhile, the additional capacity expansion at our frederick gmp oligo manufacturing facility continues to proceed as planned.
we continue to expect this capacity to come online by the end of calendar year 2022. our resolution bioscience team achieved a major milestone in the first quarter by completing the pre-market approval submission for the resolution ctdx first liquid biopsy assay as a companion diagnostic. this was done in conjunction with mirati therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer and is currently under review by the fda. it is the first of what we hope will be several indications for liquid biopsy assays.
i am pleased with how we have started the year. building on our q1 results, continued order strength, and execution prowess, we are increasing our full year financial guidance. we are raising our core growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8%, up 125 basis points at the mid-point from our prior guidance. fiscal year 2022 non-gaap eps guidance is increased to a range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, growing 11% to 13% over last year.
bob will be providing the q2 outlook, along with more detail on our improved full year guidance. we're very pleased with our q1 results and are looking forward to another strong quarter and year ahead. i'm also very confident in our team and our ability to execute and deliver for our customers and shareholders, no matter what the challenge. thank you for being on this call today and i look forward to taking your questions later.
however, for right now, i will now hand the call off to bob. bob? 
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks mike, and good afternoon, everyone. in my remarks today, i will provide some additional details on revenue, take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our improved outlook for the full year and our guidance for the second quarter. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
as mike described, we posted very strong results in q1 and exceeded expectations. revenue was $1.67 billion, up a reported 8.1%. core growth was even better at 8.9% as we overcame a greater-than-expected negative exchange rate impact of 1.3 points, while m&a added 0.5 points to growth. q1 core growth was 170 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance.
in addition, after adjusting for the 1-point headwind due to covid-19 revenues, our core growth outside of covid was roughly 10%, and as mike said, order growth was even better. again, a very strong start to the year. now moving to our end-market performance, our results were driven by a continuation of strong growth in pharma, led by biopharma, while momentum in chemical and energy and our strong results in diagnostics and clinical also led the way for us in q1. our largest market, pharma grew 17% during the quarter, on top of 20% growth last year.
the small molecule subsegment delivered high single-digit growth, while large molecule continued its strong performance, growing 32%. we are seeing our ongoing investments in biopharma paying off as demand was strong throughout the quarter. we continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the pharma market and that our business will drive above-market growth. chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 15% during the quarter.
growth in chemicals and advanced materials led the way and we expect continued growth in this business. diagnostics and clinical grew 11% on top of 9% growth last year, with all three business groups again expanding revenues nicely during the quarter. our expansion of lc/ms equipment into the clinical space continues to do well. and our growth in china was particularly strong, increasing more than 30% as we continue to penetrate this market.
the academia and government market was flat in q1. the business remained resilient despite omicron impacts in the u.s. as some universities delayed in-person learning in the period following the holiday break in december and reduced lab activity in january. we have seen lab activity improve into february and believe the funding environment remains positive.
the food segment declined low single digits against a very strong 22% growth comparison from last year. the americas were a bright spot for us, growing in the mid-teens while europe was flat and china was down due to difficult comparisons and lunar new year timing. closing out on the performance of the markets, environmental and forensics, our smallest market, was down 11%. for agilent, overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in q1, led by the americas at 13% and europe at 6%.
china grew 3% on top of 25% in q1 last year and in addition to the effect of lunar new year timing, which should benefit us in q2. now turning to the rest of the p&l, first quarter gross margin was 56.1%, up 30 basis points from a year ago. our team has done a good job increasing productivity, and pricing has helped offset higher input and logistics costs. operating margins of 26.3% increased 80 basis points even as we have increased our r&d investments.
our investments in digital technology for our internal operations also continue to pay off as we leverage our infrastructure across the company using our one agilent approach. our tax rate of 14.25% came in as expected and we had 303 million diluted shares outstanding, slightly lower than projected. putting it all together, we delivered eps of $1.21, up 14% versus last year after growing 31% in q1 of fiscal 2021. we continued to produce strong operating cash flow, generating $255 million in the quarter, beating our forecast, while we also invested $75 million in capital expenditures during q1.
and during the quarter, we took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $447 million worth of shares. we also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $510 million to shareholders. our balance sheet remains very healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. and given current market conditions, we expect to continue to be aggressive in deploying capital.
now, let's move on to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the second quarter. as mike indicated, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 7% to 8%, up from our initial guide in november of 5.5% to 7%. excluding the covid-related 0.5-point headwind this year, our new full year core revenue growth results in 7.5% to 8.5%. this new guidance takes into account our strong q1 results and an improved outlook for the rest of the year on a core basis.
while we've increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has strengthened considerably, doubling the estimated exchange rate headwinds from our initial guide to $110 million for the year, while the m&a impact remains relatively unchanged. putting it all together, we're expecting full year revenues to be between $6.67 billion and $6.73 billion. in addition, we've increased our eps guidance for the full year to $4.80 to $4.90 per share, up from the previous range of $4.76 to $4.86, and representing 11% to 13% growth versus fiscal year 2021. for q2, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.595 billion to $1.625 billion.
this represents core growth between 7% and 9% after adjusting for an expected 0.5-point impact related to covid year on year. and we expect reported growth in the range of 4.6% to 6.6%. exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 2.3% in the quarter while m&a is expected to contribute 0.3 points to growth. and closing out our q2 guidance, non-gaap eps is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.12, up 13% to 15% versus the prior year.
this is based on a 14.25% tax rate and 303 million diluted shares outstanding. again, the agilent team performed extremely well in q1 and with the solid growth we're seeing in orders and the team's willingness and ability to take on every challenge that comes their way, i'm confident that q2 and our full year results will also be strong. with that, parmeet, back to you for q&a.

operator
certainly. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of matt sykes with goldman sachs. please proceed.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, mike, bob. congrats on the quarter. thanks for taking the questions.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
maybe just starting on lsag, where you had a really good quarter, just interested to know, one, what drove the operating margin expansion in the quarter relative to your expectations and last year. and then, specifically, i know it was broad-based strength across instrument categories, but was there one or two areas that really surprised you to the upside where you feel is either underappreciated or could see continued momentum in the back half of the calendar year?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll take the first part of that, and we'll jump in and have bob and jacob add their thoughts here as well. so i think relative to the strength and why the operating margin was so high is, one, is i think we've been -- we rightly benefited from the leverage impact of having those higher-than-expected revenues. but more importantly, we've been working on the pricing side and really ensuring that we are receiving the value for our offerings.
and bob, i think we are well over 3 points of price appreciation overall for the portfolio in lsag, i believe.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's correct. that's correct.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and we are -- as you may have picked up in my script, it was across-the-board a great quarter for lsag and across all product categories. but jacob, i think a couple really stood out for you, don't -- didn't they?
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah. i think, as we know, we continue to do really well in the lc, lc/ms space, but this quarter is really spectroscopy that was standing out. we have, especially in our atomic spectroscopy field, we have really seen a lot of momentum, based, of course, on the dynamics in the markets, but also the innovation that has been created over the past year. and i think we really see the impact of that these days.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it was a real race to see who had the highest growth, right, spectroscopy or lc and lc/ms. they both did extremely well.
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
they were close.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
anything else, matt?
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and then maybe just as a follow-up. i know europe --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, i did just say for a follow-up. can you hear me?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, yes.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. sorry. just for a follow-up on europe, 6% growth. i think getting a lot of questions on just the spend environment in that region, what are you seeing there? and are there any kind of concerns you might have in terms of demand, either from the currency fluctuations or just overall demand in certain end markets within europe?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, matt. so we posted a 6% growth rate, core growth in the third quarter, albeit there was actually 2 points of headwind from the curtailment of our russia operations. so really it was high single digit, 8%, on a restated basis.
and europe clearly is a watch area for us, but we haven't seen any significant signals of movement to the downside.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think, matt, to build on what mike is saying, i think, in particular, we continue to see very strong growth in our pharma business. and that really is a global phenomenon. and -- but we also saw very nice growth in our chemical and energy businesses as well.
and so as mike mentioned, it is a watch area. but the demand from what we're seeing in the health of the order funnel continues to be there.
matt sykes -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies. please proceed.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, thanks, good afternoon. mike, could you elaborate just on the core order growth that you saw in the third quarter? and given the strength of order momentum over the last several periods, how does that inform kind of your initial thoughts on '23? i mean should we still think about 5% to 7% still being relevant? and then bob, should we expect normal 30% to 40% incrementals next year? any headwinds to consider, maybe the new asp line?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, brandon, we're probably not ready to talk about '23, but i would just leave you with a couple of thoughts here, which is, very clearly, the business has momentum. and our -- even though we had the highest revenue quarter ever for agilent in this recent third quarter, we still build backlog, both globally and also in china. so our orders that exceeded our revenue is in those. so that sets us up nicely, i think, for '23, but we'll get to '23 guide when we get there.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and i think, brandon, on your core incrementals, i mean, i think that if you look at, historically, that's where we've been. obviously, we do have some start-up costs in '23 for nasd, and we'll spell those out when we get to the numbers. but i don't think that there's going to be anything fundamentally different on an incremental basis going forward.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then on the nasd train b line, mike, you said it was pushed out a little bit in terms of the launch time line. is that like one or two months? i thought the plan was already mid next year.
could you elaborate a little more specifically on kind of where the supply chain issues, exactly what those are, that are kind of pushing the delay?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you got the right time frame in there, which is a month or two. it's really been sort of specialized steel that's required. so i actually had a chance to see it myself, where you go into a room or you're -- the steel pipe fitters are working and they're getting the area ready, and they can't close things off because they're missing one valve or something.
so we've had bits and pieces that have been missing that actually caused us certain delays. i mean the team has been all over. i think the global supply chains are pretty well-publicized. but we thought it was -- we thought we should, in the spirit of transparency, let you know we're still on track for revenue coming out of the facility in '23, but maybe a month or two later than we had thought initially.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and i think, brandon, there is one more important piece. i think based on what we know today, we still expect to be at capacity at the exit of fy '23 as well in terms of a ramp-up.
brandon couillard -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of vijay kumar with evercore isi. please proceed.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys, congrats on a really strong quarter here. hi, mike, congrats on the print. and one maybe on the guidance here. q4, at the midpoint, is at 11% organic.
you guys are just at 15%. the comps will get easier for q4. i'm curious, sequentially, when you think about it, is the change just because of the cadence of how the china deferred revenues were recognized more in 3q versus q4? can we just talk about the sequential assumptions here for the 4q guidance?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, vijay. and again, we are very, very pleased with the print. so thanks for the feedback. and bob, we didn't use it in our script, but i think the word prudent may apply to our q4 guide as well.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. yeah. i think, vijay, if you think about kind of the moving pieces within china, what we did was we pulled forward some of the revenue that was deferred into q3, but we also pulled q1 revenue into q4. so q4, i would say, we didn't have a material change one way or another.
we actually feel very good that we're going to realize that full $50 million to $55 million here in the fiscal year versus having it bleed a little into q1. and as mike said, i mean, we're not out of the woods, certainly in supply chain challenges and in covid situations, and so we thought, at this point in time, a double-digit core growth is very good but also prudent, as mike said.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
i love that word, prudent. maybe one on some of the moving parts for '23, mike. and i'm not asking for a guidance, but if i look at pricing contribution, i think we started with the year at 100 basis points. we're running at 300 basis points.
i think that pricing should continue until it annualizes until mid of next year. you did mention orders coming in about revenues. what is the backlog conversion? is that a three-month or a six-month or a 12-month visibility that you have from backlog? any impact from nasd? and sorry, on c&e very strong, but obviously, with the macro, should we perhaps be prudent for '23?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so great question, vijay. so i think i would like to -- the headline here was, as the way bob closed off his prepared remarks, we're building a strong foundation for the future. so we've got -- we had record revenues in q3, yet we still build backlog.
and some of that backlog, obviously, will carry into '23. and we -- it's probably a three- to six-month visibility for sure on the revenue coming from the backlog. and bob, i know you see that. and we agree with your thesis around pricing and the impact it will have on our '23 business as well.
and bob, maybe you want to add to --
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the only thing -- i think you're spot on, vijay. i would say there's not a material change right now in terms of how we're thinking about nasd. and if i think about the various pieces there, they certainly set us up for a good momentum going into fy '23.
now there's still some unknowns in terms of kind of the macro environment. but we're expecting to have a stronger-than-normal backlog. we certainly have that right now and are expecting to continue that into '23. and then, obviously, pricing is continuing to anniversary, and i would expect it to be a higher contributor to growth next year, all things being equal.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you, guys.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, vijay.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of puneet souda with svb. please proceed.
puneet souda -- svb securities -- analyst
hi, mike and bob. thanks for taking the questions. so first one, just lsag, obviously, a very strong quarter. and i mean, obviously, congrats on the quarter here.
when you look at the 25% growth that you're seeing in lc, overall, the order book being strong, can you maybe just characterize sort of, from an end-market perspective, it seems like biopharma continues to do well, but geographically, can you just characterize, is this contribution from biopharma china in the quarter? and how should we think about the sort of order book? can you maybe characterize the order book more geographically? and do you expect this -- again in line with sort of some of the other questions, is that sort of how should we think about this order book flow through -- flowing through into 2023?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
puneet, you packed in a lot in that one question. but we'll try to address it. sorry, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i was just saying, maybe you want to take that, bob. but i think the answer was really across the board. i mean both -- i mean, clearly, biopharma and pharma, our portfolio is doing really, really well there. and as i mentioned to the team the other day, we just got the most recent [inaudible] report, which shows market share movements.
and as my danish colleagues like to say, it was green as a danish forest. did i get that right, jacob? so --
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
that's right. that's right, mike.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
it was across the board, but i think it's -- the same story holds geographically well. so it really is a nice global story. but i think it's more than just pharma. i know you're getting some good c&e growth, right, for -- in the advanced materials, with lc, lc/ms.
we posted some really good numbers in food and the environmental market, which also are big users of lc and lc/ms. so i think it was really a broad-based story there, if i remember correctly, jacob.
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah. correct, mike. i think we've really seen good performance across the board, as you're saying, mike. and we are also seeing that the customers are really interested in our full solutions.
i think pfas is a good example of where we see a lot of interest right now, both right now, but also where we see some of the big builds that is coming through in the u.s., where pfass have a prominent exposure. so we expect to continue to see momentum in that space.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think, puneet, just to build on what mike and jacob were saying, i think one of the things you're really seeing come out in q3 is just the strength and breadth of our portfolio. and why we haven't talked about spectroscopy a lot in the past, it continues to be a very important part of our portfolio and solution set. and i think it fits nicely across multiple end markets. and the lc and lc/ms get a lot of headlines, but we're more than just an lc and lc/ms business.
puneet souda -- svb securities -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then just -- i'll keep it simple for my follow-up. polymer standards acquisition, can you characterize sort of what's the contribution this year? and how does that enhance your offering for columns and sort of biomolecules? and should -- how should we think about that overall acquisition, overall fitting into the lsag group?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
you want to take the first piece of that?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, i'll -- it's not a material business. we estimate that's less than $10 million annualized today. that's the 0.1% that we built into our guide for q4.
but more importantly, i think, strategically, i'll let jacob talk about the merits of the portfolio and how we think it's going to continue to drive growth for us.
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah. thanks for that. and we have a long-standing relationship with pss, so we knew exactly their strength. and we've been very impressed with what they have done in the polymer business for the -- for a long period of time.
and particularly, our interest was intrigued when we also see polymer science going from advanced material, into biopharma, where we see a lot of opportunities. and pss have done a wonderful job using our instrumentation together with their columns and also an informatics pack they have built, to really go after a segment of the market and also the expertise in the field. they have more than 500 application nodes within this field. so we can really leverage that with the strong presence we have across the globe to really accelerate that business opportunity that has developed over the past decades, really.
puneet souda -- svb securities -- analyst
got it. ok. great. thanks guys.
congrats again.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of rachel vatnsdal with j.p. morgan. please proceed.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the nice quarter. so first up, on china --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, rachel. thank you, thank you.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. great to hear that some of that catch-up in china was pulled forward there. and then you also pointed to double-digit growth in the region for that ex acceleration recovery. so first off, can you just walk us through specifically what drove that pull-forward on the catch-up from lockdown? and are you seeing an acceleration of demand catch up in china? and then second, how are you thinking about that longer-term growth within china? and could that be a source of upside for the year?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
great. so i'll start, bob, here. so i would have to say, it was the extraordinary effort of our team in china. i mean people sacrificed and worked tremendously hard.
we had people coming into our factories and living at the factories. they slept and worked at the factories for the entire period of when before you couldn't really get out beyond -- back to your local community. so they did that for several weeks, both in our logistics operations, as well as our factories. and that allowed us to get our global gc production going, as well as the import/export of our products as well.
so i have to say, really, it was the extraordinary effort of the team that made that happen. and we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow well in china. in q2, i think we talked about a greater than 20% order rate. we posted a number of 29% growth in q3.
yeah, we still built backlog in the third quarter in china. so i think we're well-positioned for the fourth quarter. and bob, i say that probably does represent a level of upside, potentially with things continuing to develop as we hope. the wildcards, from my perspective, are how much money could come into the segment from government stimulus.
i know they're talking about some of the things. we haven't seen any specifics. so that would be something that would be there on a positive. but again, our demand really is coming from the core private sector, commercial sector around pharma and c&e.
we think those things are sustainable.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. exactly, mike. i think you mentioned q2 kind of order growth rate, and q3 was in that same range. and so we're seeing very strong demand and been able to do a fantastic job of ramping up that capacity, and we expect that to continue into q4.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great to hear. and then last one for me, just on the c&e segment. so 22% growth is quite impressive, and that growth has really continued to accelerate in recent quarters on that end market. so how should we be thinking about that longer-term outlook for c&e, especially given some of the macro dependence on that portfolio?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
well, we think that the structure of this marketplace has changed over the last few years. and yes, that's still a segment that's tied directly to what happens to the global gdp situation. but we've highlighted in my comments, there's secular demand happening here, particularly in advanced materials, when there's investments being made in battery technology, more sustainable materials, semiconductors, onshoring of production. so we think those trends are here for a number of years.
i think our view is the sector has probably got a higher growth rate than we viewed it having a couple of years ago because of the secular aspect of growth in c&e. and bob, what else might you add there?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, as you said, i think one of the things that i think is really important, don't take '22 and take -- build it into your model because we don't think that that growth rate is going to continue. we certainly are pleased with it. but i think the other more important piece is we have a very strong right to win in the c&e business. we're a leader in this space and feel good about our portfolio.
and as mike said, this is an area that we are seeing kind of a renewed sense in some of these areas that we do think that has many years to come in terms of investment.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
i'm going to use the word, undisputed leader in the space.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i won't disagree.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, rachel.
rachel vatnsdal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of derik de bruin with bank of america. please proceed.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. this is mike ryskin on for derik. i want to follow up on your comments on price.
you sort of indicated that price continues to sort of grow as you go through the year. is that a factor of the timing of when orders are converted to revenues and when you're recognizing those revenues? so it's just more of a dynamic of that, or is this an incremental price increase that you're building in as you go through the year? and just alongside that, any comments you could say in terms of reception to price? any pushback or any particular areas where you let it take more versus last? just sort of give us an update on the pricing dynamic as we go through the year.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. hey, mike, this is bob. i'll take that in here. it's the former.
and so when we take price, it takes some time to get through the backlog. and so we're seeing the price realization from the orders that -- the price increase that we took back in the beginning of the calendar year. and really, what we're trying to do is cover our costs. and we're seeing increased logistics costs and increased material costs.
and so we've taken it across the board, but also recognizing where the costs are higher, we've taken those prices up higher. we haven't really heard any pushback, i think, as evidenced by our strong order growth. and then also we look very closely at cancellations or -- within our order book, and that continues to be very low. and so i think our customers understand why we're having to raise prices because of the inflationary environment.
and i think, to date, we've been able to actually generate more price than i think we anticipated at the beginning of the year.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. and then for the follow-up. you've commented on the balance sheet, that you're getting the leverage lower and lower.
i've done a couple of deals here and there in the past couple of years, but they definitely had been -- to be on the much smaller side. so could you talk about your willingness to lever up a little bit, to put a little bit more of that capital to work? and if so, what are the types of assets are you looking for? sort of are sellers willing to engage in this market? or is the -- how are things proceeding on that front, on the bd front? thanks.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think we've been public about being willing to take on bigger deals than what we have had historically. i think we're still -- we have the benefit of having a very strong balance sheet. we're going to first invest in our business.
we think that that's the greatest opportunity, but we're always out on the lookout for m&a. and as you said -- i would say the pipeline continues to be healthy. the dynamic has certainly changed in the last nine months, particularly on the public market side. and i think there's some good assets out there.
it's probably taken a little longer on the private market side, which is where we tend to focus our efforts. but i can tell you that we have -- the beauty of our model is that we have organic growth first and m&a as kind of an adder on top of that. and so it is something that we're continuing to look at and would be not uncomfortable levering up a little higher than where we are today for the right deal and if the economics work.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, bob.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
is that, [inaudible] to be the four times lever or --
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i'm not -- that's pretty rich. but i think it all depends on what the right asset and what it looks like.
mike ryskin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks.
operator
thank you. next question is from the line of josh waldman with cleveland research. please proceed.
josh waldman -- cleveland research -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. just two for you guys. first, mike, wondered if you could provide more context on the supply chain situation, how supply and cost could track versus your expectations over the last 90 days. have you seen any relief on supply? and then it sounds like you built backlog in q3.
curious whether your fourth quarter guide assumes any work-down in the backlog given recent order rates?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll let bob handle the second question, and i'll start with the first one. so supply chain challenges are still out there, but our team continues to do an excellent job navigating them, getting the material that we need for our customers. we continue to have very, very low order cancellation rates.
it's something we watch like a hawk. and i think we're managing the price changes. so i think in the early days of things, we were kind of surprised at what things would cost on the market for chips and others. but i think we have now found ways to work that and then offset that with some of the pricing actions that we -- i mentioned earlier.
so i think, if anything, it's probably trending in a more positive direction, albeit is still challenging out there.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and i would say, on the second question, josh, i would say, first and foremost, demand continues to be very strong in our marketplace. and so we're expecting order growth to continue into our fourth quarter. as you know, that typically is one of the larger quarters that we have for our sales organization and certainly, for our customers as well.
that being said, i would expect maybe some slight degradation in backlog just given, again, the deferral that we're talking about within china. but don't interpret that as us seeing anything slowing in the marketplace.
josh waldman -- cleveland research -- analyst
got it. and then kind of along those lines, wondered if the group has any initial thoughts on pharma budget flushing this year given the strength in orders from these accounts. curious at this point if you're getting any indication that maybe the strength in the order book is reflecting pull-forward or just not seeing that yet?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, josh, i'm going to pass this call over to padraig. he's the closest to what's going on. as you know, he heads up our one commercialization, in addition to running our acg services business. so padraig, what's your thoughts on that?
padraig mcdonnell -- president of the agilent crosslab group
yeah. no, i think it's pretty steady, mike. we're not seeing any pull-forward at this point. and of course, the team are very focused on key end-market workflows, where we have the best chance to meet the customer needs.
so we're seeing a very steady-state order rate with not much pull-forward.
josh waldman -- cleveland research -- analyst
got it. appreciate it.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, welcome.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of jack meehan with nephron research. please proceed.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. so i wanted to ask about the chemical and energy -- good afternoon. so the chemical and energy acceleration.
my first question is on the chemicals customers. so your commentary sounds pretty bullish. there's certainly been some headlines from some of the big european chemical players that have been a little bit more mixed though. so it would just be great to get your perspective on how you feel about the durability of that customer class and kind of squaring your view versus what we might be hearing from others in the market.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that may be more regionally specific to europe, where we did see a level of growth a little bit slower than we've seen in the americas and china. so i would say that's probably more regionally specific. and as we mentioned earlier on the call, europe remains sort of a watch area for us because of, obviously, all these challenges in that region right now.
but i think we think it's pretty durable right now. i mean i think it's -- remember, the chemical pieces, going into some of these supply chains as fabs go up and other things, so it's fueling some of the efforts in the advanced materials area. and bob, i know that you and jacob looked at this a little more closely. i don't know if there's anything else you would add to that?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. i think you're spot on, mike. i mean if we looked across the -- all regions grew in c&e as, mike, you were saying. but -- or europe was below the average.
and so -- but i think over time, that investment in some of these areas, we think, is ongoing demand.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
great. and then it was only a week ago, the chips and science act got signed into law. i'm not sure if you have any early perspectives as to what this might mean for agilent. if you could call out kind of the businesses that you think could benefit from some of the funding that's going in? and can you just maybe call out what could be advanced materials business to grow this quarter? thanks.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'm going to -- i'll let bob handle the second question. he's got more numbers on the pages than i do in front of him. but relative to the recent enactment by congress, we see some real upside for us.
and we actually were just talking about that before this call. i think the big debate is when is it actually going to release. but jacob mentioned earlier, pfas. there's -- what we can see, there's some funding in there for pfas, which will help our lc/ms and gc/ms business.
and then tied to the chips, both the upstream and downstream side of semiconductor fabs that play right into spectroscopy strength that we mentioned as well. and jacob, perhaps you want to add a few others --
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah. i think, i mean, actually, even though spectroscopy and gc are the big winners in the -- related to the chips act, we actually see, across the board, it's both the mass spec business, also the lc and lc/ms, that mike was mentioning and then, of course, a lot of our consumables also. and so we see a lot of opportunities here. i think both the chips act, but also the other bill, the -- what's it called, the --
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
inflation bill, and yes --
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
[inaudible] and the inflation bill here, all of them are driving some of our technologies. so we see a lot of opportunities in that. now it all comes down to timing here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and the answer to your last question, it was above 30%.
jack meehan -- nephron research -- analyst
thanks. all right. super. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of elizabeth garcia with ubs. please proceed.
liza garcia -- ubs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you so much for taking the question. congrats on the quarter.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, elizabeth, no problem. thank you very much.
liza garcia -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. great. so maybe i just didn't catch it, but i know there was the planned shutdown this quarter for nasd. but just thinking about kind of how we should think about kind of to close this quarter and then maybe sequentially as we head into the next quarter for the 4q.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and bob, you and sam want to tag-team on this one?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so yeah, we had a planned shutdown this quarter, expect return to strong growth in q4 for nasd.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and sam, i don't know if you want to add some comments about what you're seeing on the market as well.
sam raha -- president of the agilent diagnostics and genomics group
yeah. thanks, mike, and thanks for the question. i mean listen, it was a good quarter. we had the planned shutdown you already heard about.
but i want to note that we are very pleased with the trend that we're seeing, that increasingly, these very therapeutic oligos that we're working on, that the treatment modalities beyond the more rare indications are expanding into diseases for larger populations. for example, you might have seen just the recent news from alnylam that reported favorable results on their phase 3 study for patisiran. and this is for patients with attr for cardiomyopathy. and as alnylam's supplier for the api and patisiran, we're, of course, excited.
we also think this is indicative of just generally the trend that we're starting to see in the promise of therapeutic oligos. and our book of business remains strong as we go into the quarter and as we will go into next year.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, thanks, sam. i probably should elaborate a little more, elizabeth, on the routine. i think it's also important to understand why we were shutting down, right? it's both for routine maintenance, but also a critical milestone in the construction of train b.
so we tied the infrastructure together. so that's why we're speaking with confidence about our ability to get revenue in '23.
liza garcia -- ubs -- analyst
great. great news. and i guess, just one more for me, staying on the theme of kind of biopharma. so you kind of -- you've announced the collaboration with apc for real-time process monitoring.
you also had an announcement with merck around downstream pat. it would be great to kind of get your thoughts around the space and kind of the work you're doing here.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll make just some high-level comments, and then maybe, jacob, you want to provide some specifics as well. so we love this space. and we've been putting a lot of our investments over the last several years, targeted at the biopharma space.
and you see it reflected now in the growth rates and actually how we're shifting the mix of our pharma business, both in the lab but also plays outside the lab. and jacob, i know you've got a lot of interesting things happening there.
jacob thaysen -- president of the agilent life science and applied markets group
yeah. thanks for that, mike. and we are very interested in the bioprocessing space, especially from the [inaudible] perspective, where we truly believe that that instruments will start to move into the manufacturing. historically, we have had, in the small-molecule space, the qa/qc sitting in a different lab.
and now we see the opportunity to bring online, lc and lc/ms technologies, into the bioprocessing space itself or manufacturing space itself. and hence, we have decided and we have made collaborations with leaders in that space, merck being one of them, where we're developing, of course, based on our individual strength, new solutions to address that. but we're looking at multiple partnerships in this space here, and we're really bullish around that.
liza garcia -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of patrick donnelly with citi. please proceed.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions. mike, maybe one for you, just on china specifically, in terms of the linearity of the quarter. can you just talk about it? i mean it sounds like things clearly picked up as we went, obviously, on the supply side and you guys kind of got back online.
can you talk about the demand environment as well? obviously, you guys are the only ones who have kind of a full july in the quarter. so just curious what kind of ramp you saw throughout the quarter. and then again, as we work our way through august here, i mean, it certainly seems like the order growth has been encouraging. but maybe just talk about how things trended there throughout the quarter and kind of going into this quarter.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
great question. yeah, sure. happy to do so. i think it's a great question.
and i'll parse my response into two areas: orders and revenue. so i think, i would say, the order intake throughout the quarter was there. it was linear, smooth, no big lumpiness and in fact, as what we saw in the second quarter as well. so now, as you know, the revenue side has been a different story because the ability to get product in and out of china, as well as produced in china was affected by the covid-19 shutdowns.
and that's where we saw maybe a slower start, first few weeks of q3, but then the team's efforts really started paying off when we were able to get back into our facilities. so i think the ramp rate of revenue had looked at a little different profile throughout the quarter. and bob, i don't know if you would add anything.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. no, that's exactly right. i mean if you think about the months in our quarters, may was very light. as we talked about, we were ramping up, and i think we exited may at like 25% capacity.
and then the teams really started kicking it in gear as the covid restrictions started to ease. and july was very strong as they not only got the production up to full capacity, but then were able to not only satisfy existing demand, but also some of that deferral to bring it in.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
right. and they were really focused on meeting the expectations of our customers who wanted the product. and as i mentioned earlier, in my earlier comments, we had teams working a lot of overtime, working in the factories over the weekend. so really, some heroics that got us back on track.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
yeah. it's encouraging to hear. and then, bob, maybe one for you, just on the margin side. you talked about pricing a few times on the call.
can you just talk about, i guess, the flow-through to the margin side? you basically said it's offsetting some of the increase in costs. maybe just talk about the give and take on that front in terms of the pricing increases, the cost increases and how we should think about kind of that algorithm going forward on the margin piece.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think if you looked at our 150 basis points year on year, it was roughly 50 basis points in gross margin and then 100 basis points of leverage on the sg&a opex side. and i think if you looked at that, there was some productivity. as i mentioned, price probably would have kept things flat.
and then the other 50 basis points were a benefit of some productivity that the ofs team did and then the volume. that's the thing that really, i think, really helped drive a benefit in gross margin as just the amount of product that was able to be produced through the factories. and so that, i think -- think about pricing as covering our costs and then if those incrementals around better-than-expected revenues drove the margin improvement on the gross margin side. what i would say is we continue to leverage the opex side to drive our productivity as a company overall.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
helpful. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. the last question is from the line of tim daley with wells fargo. please proceed.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, everyone. thanks for the time. just quickly, i wanted to touch back on nasd here. so if we're just thinking about when we're past the train b buildout, things have kind of normalized a bit, you're starting to leverage those investments and upfront costs here, what's the clean run rate margin profile to think about in that business, i guess, initially when we get past that capacity buildout here?
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
and tim, that question brought a smile to bob's face. i'll let him answer that.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would say very good. i'll leave it at that.
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
at least 12 is the company average, right?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yup.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
all right. i can work with that. and then, i guess, just a quick one here on capital allocation. so another strong quarter of buybacks.
just thinking about the go-forward outlook, how should we be sizing this in our heads? the $1 billion, you've already hit in '22, with a quarter left to go. is that a good base for the out-years? just kind of -- just general thoughts on the capital allocation hierarchy as some assets are probably getting a bit cheaper and more attractive here.
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean i think our methodology really hasn't changed. and i think what we do is invest for growth, first internally, and then we look for value-accreting m&a. but if there isn't anything imminent, we're also not going to keep cash on the books.
and if i looked at historically, we've generated roughly 2% of earnings-per-share growth kind of below the line through share repurchase. and i think that that's probably a fair way to look at it going forward. but in terms of -- to be very clear, our priorities are investing for growth internally and then m&a before we would do share repurchases. and we're also committed to continuing to grow our dividend as well.
operator
there are no additional questions waiting at this time, so i will turn the call back over to parmeet for closing remarks.

operator
good afternoon. thank you for attending today's agilent technologies q3 '22 earnings call. my name is hannah, and i will be your moderator for today's call. [operator instructions] i would now like to pass the conference over to our host, parmeet ahuja, with agilent.
please go ahead.
parmeet ahuja -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, hannah, and welcome, everyone, to agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. with me are mike mcmullen, agilent president and ceo; and bob mcmahon, agilent senior vice president and cfo. joining in the q&a after mike and bob's comments will be jacob thaysen, president of the agilent life science and applied markets group; sam raha, president of the agilent diagnostics and genomics group; and padraig mcdonnell, president of the agilent crosslab group. this presentation is being webcast live.
the news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. today's comments by mike and bob will refer to non-gaap financial measures. you'll find the most directly comparable gaap financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year over year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis.
core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. guidance is based on exchange rates as of july 31. as previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. we have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes.
these changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. the company assumes no obligation to update them.
please look at the company's recent sec filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. and now, i would like to turn the call over to mike. 
mike mcmullen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. in the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable one agilent team. we delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. revenues of $1.72 billion are up 13% core, this is on top of 21% core growth in q3 of 2021.
third quarter operating margin of 27.5%. operating margins continue to expand and are up 150 basis points from last year. earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%. our strong results in q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business.
the momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. let's take a closer look at our q3 results. from an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our two largest markets, pharma and chemical and energy. our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago.
within pharma, both the biopharma and small-molecule segments grew double digits. the momentum in our c&e market segment continues, with q3 growth of 22%. this is on top of 23% growth a year ago. the c&e market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space.
we're also very pleased to achieve double-digit growth in the food and environmental and forensic markets, with both markets growing 11%. in our last call, i shared our belief that the business impact of the shanghai covid-19 lockdown would be transitory. i also expressed that we remain confident about the ongoing strength of our business in china. in q3, the china team delivered 29% growth.
these stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the shanghai area lockdown. we are also very pleased with this result, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the agilent china team. strength in americas continued as we posted another quarter of double-digit growth on top of 32% growth last year. our european business grew 6% against the 23% last year despite a 2-point headwind for the curtailment of our operations in russia.
in terms of business unit performance, the life science and applied markets group generated revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. growth was broad-based, with continued strong demand for our lc and lc/ms offerings, where we posted high-20s growth. our spectroscopy business grew low 30s driven by the strength in the advanced materials market. chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our gc business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
lsag's end-market growth is broad-based, with particular strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%. we had an excellent showing at the recent asms conference, introducing several important lc/ms and gc/ms instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. these innovative and intelligent lc/ms and gc/ms systems have been designed to make the lives of our customers easier.
to build an instrument intelligence and a higher-level instrument diagnostics helped maximize system uptime and improved lab productivity by allowing operators to focus on their analysis rather than their instruments. in addition, we introduced an industry-first hydroinert source for gc single-quad and gc triple quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas, to lower-cost hydrogen. and rounding out the list of new products announced at asms, we introduced the masshunter bioconfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow targeted at the fast-growing oligo-based therapy development market. these new products have already been well received by customers and represent the latest addition to agilent's history of leadership in mass spectrometry.
our lsag business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560c ion mobility lc/q-tof system, winning the scientists' choice award for best new spectroscopy product. earlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of pss, polymer standard service, a leader in polymer characterization. we're extremely pleased to welcome the pss team and their technology to the agilent family. the agilent crosslab group posted services revenue of $359 million.
this is up 10% core. we grew 10% core even as lab activity continues to ramp in china. growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. strong instrument placements and increased connect rates continued to be a driver for our service business as customers continue to see value in our acg offerings.
another critical important factor on our results is the scale and execution capability of agilent's world-class global service delivery organization in service of customers to meet their needs as we're seen as the trusted company to work with among our global customers. the diagnostic and genomics group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. this is versus that compare of 37% growth last year. the solid results in our clinical cancer testing and ngs businesses were partially offset by covid testing headwinds in the qpcr portfolio.
in addition, the dgg business in china continues to ramp from the covid-related shutdowns there. nasd revenues were up modestly in line with expectations. as we noted last quarter, q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown in our oligo manufacturing line in frederick, colorado. the shutdown of frederick was for both routine maintenance and development of key elements of our train b., our new manufacturing line to increase our capacity, $150 million-plus, when fully ramped.
while we continue to make good progress in the construction of train b, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeting a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. we see continued strong demand for oligo-based therapies as the number of approved drugs continues to increase and the pipeline of drugs in development are targeting disease states with larger patient populations. we are more confident than ever in the long-term trajectory of the market and our business. in addition to these highlights, i would like to also point to the recent release of agilent's 2021 esg report.
while we've always published our progress and sustainability in addressing societal needs, this year, we've taken our approach to the next level. we addressed these issues in a new format, that for the first time, that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues. we hope you have a chance to review our progress in esg by checking out the report on the agilent website, learning more about how we're executing our mission to advance the quality of life. agilent's q3 results again point to the strength of our diversified business and the outstanding execution ability of the agilent team.
we continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. acceleration in digital orders growth continues, as well as new customer acquisition. in addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create one agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. the strength of our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our one agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination.
and you see it in the results we're delivering. customer satisfaction hit another all-time high this quarter. we continue to outgrow the market. as a result of our strong q3 performance and continued momentum, we're once again raising our full year revenue and eps guidance.
bob will share more of the specifics. it's an exciting time at agilent, with the best yet to come. thank you for being on the call today. and now, i will hand the call off to bob.
bob?
bob mcmahon -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everyone. in my remarks today, i'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. i'll then finish up with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-gaap results.
we are extremely pleased with our q3 performance. results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. fx was a 4-point headwind to growth or $76 million.
pricing for the quarter contributed over 3 points of growth year on year and improved sequentially. the performance was broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. as we mentioned last quarter, the covid-related lockdowns in china deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. our team in china did a fantastic job ramping production and shipments faster than expected following the shutdowns.
we estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in q3, exceeding our expectations. given the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. the acceleration of the covid-related shutdown recovery in china contributed to an already strong q3 for the company. for perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery.
as mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. this performance is against our most difficult comparison of the year as eps grew 41% in q3 of last year. now let me dive a little deeper into the end markets. our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations.
biopharma grew 18% and small-molecule was up 14%. biopharma is a focus area for us and now represents 38% of our overall pharma business. we expect that ratio to continue to climb over time. in addition, all three business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment.
and our lc portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us. chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. we saw strength in plastics and packaging for chemicals and ongoing demand in advanced materials coming from the markets for semiconductors and batteries. in the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago.
strength in the food market was led by the americas and china. our environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter driven by the americas and china. in the americas, we saw increased funding to support pfas testing, while china experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the shanghai shutdowns for gc and gc/ms. the academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations.
and rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. while not material at the agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with covid-related revenues being lower than last year. excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter. on a geographic basis, china led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the covid-related lockdowns.
and looking forward, demand in china continues to be very strong. the americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations. now turning to the rest of the p&l. our team continues to execute at a very high level.
third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding.
looking at cash flow and our balance sheet. we generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during q3 driven by our nasd expansion. during the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. we paid out $62 million in dividends in q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter.
year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment. our balance sheet continues to remain healthy, with a net leverage ratio of one. now let's move to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter.
we now expect revenues for the full year to be in the range of $6.75 billion to $6.775 billion. this takes into account our q3 results and an improved outlook in q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. this represents core revenue growth of between 9.9% and 10.3%. we are also raising our eps guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year on year.
this translates to q4 revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion. core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and m&a will contribute 0.1 points. in closing out our q4 guidance, non-gaap eps is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. this is based on a 14% tax rate and 299 million diluted shares outstanding.
the agilent team once again performed extremely well in q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. our diversified business, and most importantly, our team, have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in q4. and now, back to parmeet, as we take your questions. parmeet?
