vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir. i also wanted to say thank you, all, for joining today's conference call. if we move to slide 3, with me today, i have a number of my ecn colleagues, harry, susanne, marie-france, john tsai, richard, and shannon. and we'll be available to take your questions and also will be joining me for parts of the -- the presentation.
so, if we move to slide 5, over the past three years, we've been executing on a strategy we set out in 2018 to focus the company -- focus on certain geographies to accelerate our growth and to focus on five strategic priorities that we remain committed to and believe in the long run will enable novartis to sustainably grow and sustainably have impact on healthcare around the world and deliver on our purpose to reimagine medicine. now, when you look at some of the proof points as we've set out on this journey, we believe we're making good progress. always more to do, always things to learn where we're making good progress. we're 100% focused now as a medicines company; we have a leading pipeline across 10 therapeutic areas for advanced therapy platforms, unique in that having only 8% of our sales, and one product, and over 15 blockbusters; we have achieved $2 billion in cost savings over the last three years; a leading data science platform that's enabling us to weather this pandemic and i believe sets us up for the medium and long term; consistently improving esg scores, now with sector-leading performance in four key indices; and from a culture standpoint, record-high engagement scores across multiple different measures.
now, moving to slide 6, when you look at how the strategy is translated into operational performance, we see solid operational performance over the past three years with sales growing 5% from $42 billion now, approaching $49 billion core up and growing double digit at 10%, exceeding now $15 billion. and we've reached our goal -- our initial goal of innovative medicines core margin to 35%, on our way to our mid-term goal of the high-30s which we are well on track to achieve. now, turning to this year's perform -- sorry the 2020 performance and q4 performance on slide 7, you can see a breakdown of some of the key drivers. as you saw on our release, net sales for the full year were up 3% and core operating income up 13%.
our overall performance in q4, as well as the full year, were driven by our key growth drivers entresto and cosentyx continuing to demonstrate double-digit growth. a broad range of oncology medicines also demonstrating double-digit growth. and taken together. we now have over half of our sales coming from our key growth drivers and launches in innovative medicines, positioning us well for the future and positioning us well to overcome the patent expiries we have in this period and continue to drive growth through 2025 and beyond.
now, moving to slide 8, i wanted to dive into a few of the products and sandoz before turning it over to my colleagues. first, on zolgensma, full-year sales were $920 million in the first full year since launch. medicine is now registered in 37 countries. we're making very good progress in the rollout of this medicine around the world.
as you saw in q4, we had sales of $254 million which were lower than q3. this was driven primarily by covid-19-related impacts, delaying new starts as hospitals face disruption and we saw physicians delaying starts or switches to the product, as well as delays in reimbursement decisions in some of the european and emerging markets we're currently working with. we expect this impact to continue through the first half of 2021. we would expect sales in that q3-q4 range before an acceleration in the second half of the year.
but we remain confident in the longer-term potential of the medicine in the iv form to reach ultimately $2 billion. it remains the treatment of choice for newly diagnosed patients. we're seeing about 15% of patients in the eu in the older-than-2-year-age range. we're on our way to get access in nine eu countries which would be about 25% of the population.
and we have important formal reimbursement decisions in 15 countries over the coming year to two years. so, taken together, we think we're on the right track. when you look at the it program, we continue to await the animal data which we expect to have in the middle of this year -- to the back half of this year to remove the partial clinical hold if the data is -- confirms the safety profile. we are working with the fda to finalize the design of a pivotal confirmatory study which we would rapidly plan on implementing.
we continue to pro -- progress our 10 early stage portfolio -- programs in gene therapies with two inds and clinical trial starts planned in 2021. now, moving to slide 9, i also wanted to say a word regarding our performance in china. now, as you saw in our release, we were very, very pleased with our growth in china with sales growing 16%, second fastest among multinationals in china. our goal is to double our sales in the country by 2024, making china the second-largest market for novartis in the world.
our key growth driver is similar to what we see in other geographies. our entresto, cosentyx, as well as our other oncology strategic brands. what's very notable, i think, is the number of nrdl listings we achieved, we believe the highest in the -- in the industry in 2020. we also have a rich pipeline with seven approvals expected in 2021.
so, taken together, we think we're on the right track to reach our goals in china and really continue to dive -- drive dynamic growth in this important market. now, moving to slide 10. with respect to sandoz, you saw in the full year, sandoz matters the sales guidance largely in line for the full year and the quarter. importantly, sandoz was able to drive 15% core operating income growth moving its core margin up to 24.2%.
some of the pushes and pulls for sandoz a continued strong biopharmaceuticals performance with 19% growth, primarily in -- in the european market but also held back a bit by our retail -- retail declines we saw driven by covid-19 and the u.s. oral solids business that we now retained. i think taking a longer-term view on sandoz, we remain determined to build a business that can grow mid-single digit with margins in the mid-to-high 20s, really competitive with the top end of the peer set. and we expect to be able to do that through a robust biosimilars pipeline, as well as high loe coverage among small molecules through the 2024 period.
now, moving to slide 11, i didn't want to say a word about the company's efforts to overcome the covid-19 challenges we see in the marketplace. harry will talk a little bit more about our guidance. but certainly, when you look at the healthcare systems' performance over the back half of last year, we continue to see a situation where healthcare systems didn't return fully to their pre-pandemic levels. here on the left-hand side of the chart, you see two examples.
in dermatology, we continue to see patient visits and nbrx below the pre-pandemic levels. in the bottom, you can see in the oncology markets, depending on the cancer setting, you have biopsy and surgery rates below pre-pandemic levels, also in the cdk4/6 market. so, for the first half of the 2020 -- 2021, we expect to continue to see challenges for -- for certain therapeutic areas such as dermatology and ophthalmology, as well as in sandoz retail. we expect that some of our new launches will be impacted though we expect to continue to see solid progress and you'll hear more about that from marie-france on preparing for these launches to accelerate in the back half of the year such as kesimpta and mayzent.
and we also know products that involve hospital initiation such as kymriah, lutathera, and zolgensma will face a tougher situation in the first part of the year. again, we would plan to overcome that in this period and then hopefully see acceleration in the second half of the year. now, moving to slide 12. returning to our innovation performance and innovation milestones in q4, we saw the approval of leqvio in the eu six months ahead of schedule.
we saw the positive fda adcomm for entresto in preserved ejection fraction heart failure, as well as a number of other notable achievements, a number of designations achieved for iptacopan and ligelizumab, i think demonstrating the potential of these medicines as they continue to progress in late-stage development. we also signed an important in-licensing deal on tislelizumab with beigene for anti-pd1, which we hope we'll be able to file later this year in the u.s. and other markets. i also wanted to say a word, as i know there have been a number of questions on leqvio and an update on the crl.
now, first and foremost, it's important to note that there are no safety, efficacy, or product-related concerns with respect to leqvio in the crl. the -- as i mentioned, the eu fully approved this product out of the same facilities that we also filed for the u.s. fda. the crl was related to facility inspection related conditions, primarily related to documentation and controls -- certain control systems at a third-party manufacturer in europe.
we expect based on the third party's readiness to complete the request made by fda to be able to submit the documentation and other requests of fda in the q2, q3 time period. we still do not know if the fda will ultimately want to inspect this facility. as noted previously, the fda had originally planned to inspect this facility in may of 2020. they are currently not conducting overseas inspections in situations like this.
so, we'll continue to have to work with the fda to try to expedite that inspection. and we're concurrently working on a tech transfer to add our own novartis facility in shops now for the production supply chain of leqvio. so, we remain confident we will get this product approved as fast as possible and then continue our plans to launch this medicine, which -- in a highly effective way, which marie-france will go through in a bit more detail in a moment. now, moving to slide 13, other innovation milestones that we expect for 2021.
multiple major approvals, kesimpta in the eu, entresto -- have passed for an expanded indication for entresto, a number of major submissions you can see listed here including asciminib in cml. we have also a range of major readouts that -- which would enable submissions in 2021, notably canakinumab, sabatolimab, mbg453, and lu-psma, among others. we also will hope to see the readouts of ligelizumab and cosentyx which would enable submissions in 2022. and i also wanted to say a word on our next wave of assets, which you can see on slide 14.
here, we lay out the five life cycle management programs, five pharmaceutical programs, five oncology programs, and five wildcards we highlighted in our meet the management meetings. and in many of these programs, we have milestones expected in 2021. you can also see the milestone chart in the appendix of this document. i'll note a few.
we expect the paradise post-ami trial to read out in the first half of 2021. i already mentioned cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa, the kisqali-monaleesa-2 os in the second half of 2021. we'll see important mid-stage readouts for iptacopan in iga nephropathy at c3g. we'll see also an important phase iib start for branaplam in huntington's disease.
and then, of course, the range of oncology milestones as well across the oncology -- various oncology molecules. important to note, in all of these projects, we have full teams working to accelerate them and working as fast as possible to maintain their progress through the pandemic and beyond. particularly, we're looking forward to continue to advance our shp2 inhibitor and our c-raf inhibitor as well in the oncology portfolio. so, i hope that gives you an overview of our story -- well, mid- and long-term story, most importantly, but also our story in q4 and for 2021.
and with that, i'll hand it over to marie-france. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
thank you, vas. so, going on to slide 16. good morning, good afternoon. i'm pleased to update you on the 2020 performance for pharma.
we grew 5% year-over-year in a challenging environment. and our growth drivers, cosentyx and entresto, showed continued momentum and now account for $6.5 billion in revenues. but the story that stands out here is the shift that you see in our portfolio. the contribution from growth drivers and launches went from 33% to 43%, and that demonstrates our replacement power in light of several patent expiries expected.
we're delivering strong operational performance in the end-market growth drivers. we also made progress in the next wave of potential launches, providing the basis for growth in 2021 and beyond. slide 17, once again, cosentyx delivered double-digit growth and reached $4 billion for the full year. our focus is on continuing to compete strongly to maintain our position in dermatology and accelerate in rheumatology.
we know what we need to do to grow. we need to make sure we maintain broad access and balance that with a long-term value of cosentyx, and you can expect us to continue to do that. we'll expand into new geographies. in fact, we're now the only innovative biologic with broad nrdl listing in china.
and we'll make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace with our industry-leading approach to data and presence, as well as a number of new indications as we deliver on our ambitious life cycle management program. there is still tremendous opportunity in this market. and between the data, the access, and our outstanding teams, we have what it takes for cosentyx to continue to grow. on slide 18, entresto continues to deliver 44% full-year growth, and the momentum continues across all of the geographies.
as you know, we're the only single-use medicine proven to be superior to previous standard of care. and thus, we're in a strong competitive position. it's also great to see that the american college of cardiologists expert consensus now recommends that heart failure patients go direct to arni. and this puts entresto in a pole position for the 75% of patients who are still on standard -- standard -- sorry, previous standard of care.
we also have exciting opportunities for growth with expansion in china and japan as well as our life cycle management program for pef or preserved ejection fraction in post-ami. if we move to the next slide, the adcomm discussion for pef reinforced the unmet need as well as entresto's value in the treatment of preserved ejection fraction. and specifically, in patients with ejection fraction below normal. ultimately, the addressable patient pool will depend on the label.
what i can tell you is that the total pef population is about 3 million in the u.s. and about 2 million of them have an ejection fraction below normal. we know from our deep experience in ref that guidelines matter in this market. so, our update will be gradual as the guidelines evolve.
overall, we're very comfortable with entresto's peak consensus, and we're confident that entresto is going to continue on its impressive growth trajectory. if we move to slide 20 and on to kesimpta, we've said we have high expectations for this product. our team is executing very effectively on the launch. in fact, we have beat all of our plans on gaining access.
we're seeing broad adoption. we have leading share of attention, onboarding is fast, and initiation is simple. but we do feel that it is more challenging to launch during a pandemic. we cannot move as fast as we would like due to the limited face-to-face access to physicians.
and what we're also seeing is a hesitancy to switch as physicians and patients prefer to wait. but this does not change our ambition for this product. we think that b-cell therapies have the potential to account to up to 40% of market share in ms. and we're positioning kesimpta as a first choice dmt, as we relentlessly track for the highest customer satisfaction.
we have the foundational elements in place. we're focusing on breadth. and with our free drug program, once we're out of this pandemic and we can pool our full promotional power behind kesimpta, we will really see the potential of this product. if we move on to slide 21, we're also enthusiastically preparing for the launch of leqvio.
leqvio received eu approval in december, and we expect a slow and steady start. we also plan to roll out our first population health agreement with the u.k. nhs in quarter three. in the u.
s., as you've heard, we have a manufacturing-related delay which we're working to resolve. but what is important to remember is that we're thinking about this launch very differently. our aim is to partner with healthcare systems on ascvd management to overcome the non-clinical barriers to tackling this disease at scale. we're now using this time to advance our engagement with healthcare systems and to set up the needed infrastructure so that we can be stronger out of the gate once we get the green light from fda.
slide 22, 2020 was definitely a year like no other, but the external environment did not stop us from doing what we're passionate about and that is bringing medicines to patients. our teams have worked hard and demonstrated great agility and resilience, and i am very proud of this team. our 2021 strategy builds on the good work done. number one, we want to maintain the momentum on cosentyx and entresto, penetrating markets further and delivering on our life cycle management programs.
two, executing our launches, ramping up kesimpta, bringing leqvio to market, and restoring confidence in beovu. and three, getting ready for the next wave of launches. geographically, we have a clear focus on the u.s. and china, and we're putting our customers at the core of our strategy.
you will see us working in a much more personalized fashion with physicians, leveraging the investments that we've made in data and digital, and with healthcare systems to deliver access to more patients faster. over to susanne.
susanne schaffert -- president, novartis oncology
thank you, marie-france. so, moving to slide 24, the oncology business had solid performance despite significant generic erosion and covid impact, delivering 3% growth and reaching $14.7 billion. in q4, we have seen very good momentum across our portfolio, mainly driven by the strong uptake of our recent launches and continued strong performance of our growth drivers. and these brands could also more than compensate for the continued generic erosion of afinitor and exjade/jadenu in the u.s.
and sandostatin lar in the eu. due to the pandemic, some areas of our business, as mentioned by vas, like the hospital-initiated therapies and specifically breast cancer therapies, continues to experience delays in new patient starts, as well as concerns about patient management during covid. and -- but i have to say our team has really stepped out, and we leveraged our robust digital capabilities embarked on -- and embarked on omni-channel launches for tabrecta in the u.s. and piqray and adakveo in europe and are very pleased that this launch has continued gaining momentum despite limited face-to-face interactions with physicians.
moving to slide 25 and kisqali. kisqali delivered a very strong performance in 2020, with full-year sales up 45%, reaching $870 million. and this is driven by the unprecedented overall survival benefit from two pivotal phase iii clinical trials. we are also very pleased to see kisqali continue growing and gaining market share despite the overall slowdown of the cdk4/6 market, driven by suppressed patient screening and overall decrease in new patient starts.
at a recent congress in san antonio, we were very proud to share that kisqali demonstrated the longest median overall survival among all phase iii trials in advanced breast cancer, reaching nearly five years of survival in premenopausal patients. and additionally, we presented the pool data from monaleesa studies that confirmed efficacy across luminal and estrogen therapy-resistant her2-enriched patient subtypes. and these data confirm that kisqali's ability to selectively inhibit cdk4 may store endocrine sensitivity in these very aggressive tumors. on the development side, the natalee adjuvant study in intermediate and high-risk population is enrolling incredibly well, and we are on track for final readout in 2022.
so overall, we are very pleased with the performance of kisqali and remain very confident in this brand. moving to slide 26. also, kymriah had an excellent year with sales up 68%, driven by strong double-digit growth across all geographies despite pandemic conditions. we continue to expand our global presence with now over 290 centers qualified to administer kymriah across 27 markets.
commercial manufacturing for kymriah has been expanded with the recent approval of fbri in japan, and this is building on previous approvals of stein and les ulis earlier in the year. in 2020, we made also significant progress in expanding our global manufacturing capacity with a 70% increase compared to previous year. and we also continue to improve the robustness of our process, leading to an increased manufacturing success rates. on the development side, we were pleased to share the new data from the elara trial showing that kymriah is effective in pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.
submission for this important indication is expected later this year. and we have also presented the juliet updated efficacy results which showed continued durable responses for patients with relapsed or refractory dlbcl. we also continue to invest in our car-t cell therapies. there's already two new car-t assets in phase i trials being manufactured on a completely novel car-t platform.
with this technology, we expect to increase manufacturing reliability, shorten the turnaround times, and the preservation of certain t cell subpopulation. moving to next slide, we'd like to share with you the exciting data we have recently presented at ash on asciminib, our first-in-class stamp inhibitor that has the potential to transform cml treatment standards. in the phase iii ascembl trial, asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response rate at 24 weeks compared to bosutinib in patients resistant to or intolerant of at least two prior tkis. asciminib also demonstrated favorable safety profile, underscoring that stamp inhibition reduces the off-target adverse events typical for tkis.
the u.s. fda has granted fast track designation earlier in december and we are on track with the u.s. and eu submissions in the first half of '21. we also continue evaluating multiple development options for asciminib in early treatment lines in cml and looking forward to update you in the future.
moving to slide 28. i would like to give an outlook also on '21. we will continue to maximize our growth drivers and we expect continued growth from kisqali. we are going to leverage the increased manufacturing capacity to drive further growth in kymriah.
and for lutathera, we plan to unlock the potential in the community setting in the u.s. and grow use in earlier lines. we expect also continued growth from our growth drivers, revolade/promacta, jakavi, and tafinlar/mekinist. we are also committed to deliver on our launches.
we will further expand piqray in the u.s. and gain momentum in europe. and we hope to continue strong on adakveo, expanding to larger accounts in the u.s. and continue global rollout.
we will further maximize the first-mover advantage with tabrecta in the u.s., and we'll continue driving awareness of cml and the unmet need and the importance of stamp inhibitors. last but not least, we will prepare for our next big bet, lutetium-psma, by advancing our commercial organization for the readout of vision trial later this year and also focus in medical education on canakinumab to establish the importance of pro-tumor inflammation. another important focus for us is the medical education on sabatolimab to build awareness for the dual mechanism of action of tim-3 in mds and aml. and as vas said, we are advancing our early assets, tno155 and lxh254 in a broad range of combination studies.
moving to slide 29. just to give you an update on the recently announced deal to in-license tislelizumab from beigene. this is a late-stage pd-1 inhibitor specifically engineered to minimize binding to the fc gamma receptor on macrophages. tislelizumab has 15 potentially registration enabling clinical trials are currently ongoing with first ex-china filing expected in 2021.
with this deal, novartis obtains development and commercial rights on key markets, ex-china, including u.s., europe, and japan. it is a very attractive asset for us as we look to expand our presence in the checkpoint inhibitor space, and it provides us with an opportunity to launch a pd-1 sooner in broad and important indications such as lung cancer. we have identified also multiple potential combination opportunities with the novartis portfolio across all of our four therapeutic platforms. so, we are very excited about collaborating with beigene to bring tislelizumab to patients around the world.
and we are looking forward to provide you with more updates after the transaction is closed later this year. and with that, i hand over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
thank you, susanne. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide you with our 2021 guidance. as always, my comments refer to results of continuing operations and growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted.
so, turning to slide 31. we compare our actual results here with our 2020 latest guidance. and as you know, we've revised our core operating income guidance upward in october. and i'm pleased to say that we met both core operating income and the sales guidance.
on sales, given the resurgence of covid-19 in quarter four, we ended at a low end of the 3% to 4% range, as we mentioned during the quarter three investor call. now, on slide 32 showed a summary of the performance for quarter four and full year. i will focus on the full-year results on the right-hand side. full-year performance was solid, with sales growing 3% and both core operating income and core eps growing 13%.
sales were, of course, mainly driven by entresto, zolgensma, and cosentyx. core operating income growth was driven by higher sales, some lower spend, and significant productivity programs. operating income grew 19%, driving net income growth of 20%. we will come back to the free cash flow number, which was $11.7 billion, a little later.
overall, clearly, a solid yearly performance, especially given the challenging business environment we are all in. next, let's focus on the core margins, on slide 33, again showing on the right-hand full year and left-hand quarter four. for the full year, continuing operations' core margin was 31.7%, growing 280 basis points in constant currencies, with strong improvements in both divisions. innovative medicines margin reached 35%, as outlooked, up 220 basis points, allowing us to achieve our previously announced mid-30s core margin target a couple of years earlier than planned and sandoz margin grew by 330 basis points to 24.2%.
clearly, our full-year margins show we are well on track to deliver on our innovative medicines margin targets of the high 30s in the mid-term as well as our sandoz margin target of mid-to-high 20s in the mid-term. let's go to the next slide. as mentioned earlier, our free cash flow for the full year was $11.7 billion, down 10% versus prior year. obviously, this was because higher operating income was more than offset by the payments related to legal matters and higher divestment proceeds in the prior year.
now, turning to our full-year 2021 guidance on slide 35. we expect sales to grow low to mid-single-digit and core operating income to grow mid-single-digit, ahead of sales-driving core margin increase. within the divisions, we expect innovative medicine sales to grow mid-single digit and sandoz topline to be broadly in line with the prior year. the sandoz guidance is due to the impact of covid on our retail business and expected decline of u.s.
oral solid business. the key assumption for this guidance, importantly, is that we see a return to normal global healthcare systems and prescribing dynamics by the middle of 2021. and in addition, we assume that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics enter in 2021 in the u.s. please also note that the overall generic impact is expected to be in the range of the negative minus 3% of sales, similar to what we saw in 2020.
we expect there to be continued generic erosion on brands, including afinitor, exjade, gleevec, also with some mature ophtha brands and diovan. on slide 36, i would like to explain the dynamics that we expect to see in quarter one, given that we have quite a significant covid impact last year quarter one, which, of course, would impact the growth rate. so, as you recall, there was a significant forward purchasing in quarter one of last year and we had approximately three points of growth that largely reversed in quarter two with no overall impact on the full year 2020. so as a result, in quarter one 2021, we anticipate sales to decline low to mid-single digits year on year.
the quarter one underlying performance, excluding the stocking effect, is expected to be broadly in line with prior year due to the continued covid-19 impact on healthcare systems and patient visits. turning to slide 37. in 2021, we do expect further margin expansion, as mentioned earlier, with core operating income growth. and the magnitude, however, will be lower compared to 2020, where we increased core margins by 280 basis points.
expected positive drivers of future core operating income growth include the continued performance of our growth drivers, the launch uptake of kesimpta and other launches, as well as productivity programs and continuing adoption of our new ways of working. growth will be partly offset by increased launch and pre-launch investments, mainly kesimpta and leqvio, as well as development costs for tislelizumab which we recently in-licensed from beigene, of course, only after the completion of the transaction. we will also likely see further investments into growth drivers as we expect physician access to normalize from the middle of the year. on slide 38, i would like to add some perspective on other key financial elements of the expected quarter one performance.
as you can see, we expect core net financial expenses to be broadly in line with 2020 and also the 2021 core tax rate to be around 16%. next slide, please. so, as you can see here on slide 39, we are pleased to propose our 24th consecutive dividend increase to chf 3 per share, with an increase of 2%, with our dividend yield remaining above 3% and fully in line with our dividend policy of increasing our dividend every year in swiss francs. and finally, on slide 40, as currency is consistently -- constantly changed, i want to bring your attention the estimated currency impact on our results using the current exchange rate.
so, if late january rates prevail for 2021, we would see a full-year impact of currencies on sales around 3% to 4% positive and on core operating income 3% positive. for quarter one, as you can see here, sales would be positive 4% and on core operating income of positive 2%. and as you know, we update these expected currency impacts every month on our website. with that, i hand back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thank you, harry. turning to slide 42. just a final word on our esg progress as a company.
i think as many of you know, we've placed a high priority in being a leader in our sector on esg across our four main areas of focus through our materiality assessment. some of the highlights include the issuance of the first industry sustainability-linked bond for access to medicines. our commitment for full carbon plastic and water neutrality by 2030. we were just ranked today number two in the access to medicines index that was just announced and continued to see strong progress in our d&i and other corporate citizenship efforts.
all of this has led to improvements in our esg rankings, and we continue to work to being a leader in the esg efforts across the sector in the years ahead. so, moving to slide 43. as we noted in our meet the management meeting in november, we're confident we will grow top and bottom line every year to 2025 and meet external expectations of 4% growth, reaching $60 billion in sales in 2025 and reaching the consensus margin of 37.6% in 2025. and we look forward to continuing to demonstrate our progress on this front as we move through the quarters ahead.
so, closing on slide 44, as you see, we delivered on our strategic and operational commitments and advanced our strategic priorities in 2020 despite the challenging business environment. our third year of sales, core operating income, and margin improvement i think demonstrating the operational effectiveness of the organization. we're progressing our pipeline, deep, mid, and late-stage pipeline as well as important milestones in 2020. and as i noted, expect top and bottom-line growth every year through 2025.
so, with that, we can open the line for questions. [operator instructions] thank you. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. your first question today comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much for taking my questions. it's mark purcell from morgan stanley. so, just firstly for harry.
harry, could you just help us further with the sort of phasing of growth through the course of the year? so, as you said for q1, underlying growth roughly flat. should we assume a similar thing for q2 which sort of sets you out for 8% to 9% sales growth in the second half of the year to reach the guidance? and is there anything you see in terms of the phasing of sandoz which we may not have as much visibility on which is different to that pattern? and then secondly, vas, maybe one for you. with tislelizumab and the beigene deal, obviously, this is exporting innovation out of china, one of the first products to do so. so, is there a potential challenge here in terms of exporting the product at a lower price point when it comes to negotiating pricing agreements with the -- with governments globally? or is the lower price points in china potentially something you could use to your advantage when it comes to transferring the value into potential combinations of your next-generation assets, so thinking of things such as tim-3, shp2, cd73, et cetera? so, it'll be useful to get some context there.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thanks, mark. harry, on phasing of growth?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, mark. yeah, the last year was quite interesting with the forward buy, if you will, as healthcare systems try to get some inventory, and also at the patient level longer scripts have been given. so, we have this $400 million roughly effect of forward buy or stocking in quarter one and then they destocked in quarter two.
that's roughly three points on our quarter. so, of course, then, quarter two would have the reversed positive effect. another effect we had in quarter two is that lucentis, tragically many patients skipped or doctors skipped one injection. that's now fully back.
so, quarter two, we should see some good growth. and so, the first half, i would say we do expect to be broadly in line with prior year, maybe low single-digit growth as totality, right? first, decline in quarter one and then some good growth in quarter two is the expectation. that is broadly in line with prior year, especially what we have seen the last two quarters. as you think about the second half of 2020, quarter three was zero, quarter four was plus one, and that was the environment that we expect the next couple of quarters to be in.
so, that's why we believe that is a reasonable scenario. of course, there's unprecedented volatility and therefore, we have to plan in different scenarios. so, then as you say, you know, in the second half, we do expect some very good growth. but again, we talk ranges and have to see how quickly then the healthcare systems open up.
so, i think that phasing of half one, half two, and then if you have to do this quarter one stocking, quarter two destocking of last year should give good feeling for how to model the quarters. i don't want to get into innovative medicines or sandoz; i think it will get too granular. but you have seen last year, the quarter one, quarter two of both divisions and i think that should be helpful.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. on tislelizumab, you know, broadly speaking, our goal is to maximize the value of this asset. we have a -- asset that can participate in the $50 billion-plus pd-1 market around the world. we have the full commercial flexibility to maximize the value of the product.
and then our goal, of course, is to leverage the medicine across the full combination possible across novartis' oncology portfolio. so, we have a number of combination studies already planned, and we believe having a hopefully soon approved pd-1 in u.s. and then later also in europe will enable us to accelerate our own combination programs across the full range of our portfolio. i can't comment and it's too soon i think and premature to comment on pricing, strategies, et cetera.
but i think once the deal closes and we're further along we can, of course, provide more granularity, and susanne can provide more granularity on our commercial strategies.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello. thank you. two product-specific questions, please. firstly, for zolgensma in the u.s., i think you said at your last set of results that you had 74% newborn coverage and your goal now is, i think, 80% by the end of the year if i heard it right.
does that mean that you think that access is only really going to expand sort of incrementally in the u.s. this year and sort of in practical terms there won't be very much extra? or is there a more optimistic scenario in there? and then secondly on kesimpta, do you have a rough idea of when you expect that you'll start to see the majority of sales come from paid-for products rather than free products? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, laura. so, on zolgensma, what we ended up seeing in 2020 was newborn screening coverage in the u.s. in the high-60s, and our goal is to get that into the high-80s in the -- over the course of 2021.
and in that setting, we would expect, again, zolgensma to have a very high -- a very high market share in states that have newborn screening. alongside that, we also are working hard to get better, even further medicaid coverage with hopefully getting a significant number of additional states fully putting in place medicaid programs. so, we haven't seen this as a significant barrier. we do think that will ease the ability to get patients started.
i would still say in general, i mean, the biggest constraint right now on zolgensma growth is more the pandemic than the underlying demand. we see very good dynamics, very solid aav testing rates around the world. we see a strong interest for governments to put in place reimbursement programs. but it does take more time in the pandemic and we do see physicians delaying starts with zolgensma simply because of the initiation procedures involved with such a therapy.
so, we're hopeful that as the pandemic recedes or healthcare systems stabilize, we'll see an acceleration over the course of the year. now, turning to kesimpta, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
so, thank you, laura. our bridging program is available for commercial patients for up to 12 months. so, we've had a generous program, and i can tell you that the majority of kesimpta patients are currently on this bridging program. we expect the conversion to paid products with share of free goods to decline from 70% to 30% over the course of the year, and that will obviously drive up the sales ramp-up.
what's important here is that we expect three-quarters of 2021 sales to be realized in the second half of the year, and this of course assumes the pandemic recovery in line with group guidance. what i can say in the meantime is that the team is doing an incredible job with the launch. we've seen access and we've beat our own internal benchmarks on access. we're seeing naive patients at 17%.
we have leading share of attention. we've made sure that we focus on making fast initiations and making it easy, so we're in good shape. we're building the foundation. we have a good free goods program and we're hoping to accelerate the sales in the second half of the year.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, marie-france. thanks, laura. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matthew weston from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matthew weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. two questions, please. one, vas, at the cmd in late november you expressed confidence in consensus, and i think a lot of investors took that to mean each year rather than just 2025; now the 2021 guide seems to be somewhat below consensus. so, you obviously had good visibility on the challenges of covid in late november, so can you just tell people if there is anything that's fundamentally changed since late november, or really, it's just the pattern of growth out to 2025 that potentially was misinterpreted? and then secondly on entresto in pef, again, just referencing that meet management, you put it in the $500 million to $1 billion peak sales bucket.
now, that you've heard the adcomm commentary and you've obviously had further interaction with fda, do you think that peak sales potential is conservative given the number of patients that you've just laid out in the presentation today?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matthew. on the first point, you know, our intention in meet the management was to provide confidence over the five-year period and not to provide any sort of annual milestones with respect to consensus. so, certainly, if that was misinterpreted, i apologize that we were not clear enough.
i think what we did say is we plan to consistently grow sales and core operating income. we do that this year; we grow core operating income ahead of sales. we also have tried to be consistent that the margin progression will not be at a steady pace, but we will get to the high-30s as we outlined as well. so, i think we're on track.
nothing fundamentally has changed. and when we look at that 4% growth out to 2025 and the margin out to a rounded 38%, we feel very good with our ability to achieve that with the portfolio that we have in hand. now, with respect to hfpef, maybe i'll turn it over to marie-france to give a little bit of the range of patient numbers and potential.
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
thank you, vas. so, the adcomm discussion really reinforced the unmet need for entresto's value in the treatment of pef, and we see this specifically in this group of patients with ejection fraction before normal. but it's difficult at this point to give you a specific range because that's going to depend on the addressable patient pool which will obviously depend on the label. what i can say is that the total pef population is about 3 million patients in the u.s., and about 2 million of them have an ejection fraction below normal.
we also know in this market, and this is critical, i referenced it before, that it's important to have guidelines. so, our uptake is going to be gradual as those guidelines are updated, and we're going to continue to keep our consensus around $4 billion to $5 billion for total entresto sales. so, we previously guided $3 billion to $4 billion on refs and we are guiding $4 billion to $5 billion on refs and pefs together.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, marie-france. thanks, matthew. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of steve scala from cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. the inclisiran situation in the u.s. is perplexing. two months ago, novartis had been anticipating a year-end 2020 approval, then said the facility review only related to paperwork and might not be needed, and now the product appears delayed a year in the u.s.
so, something seems not right and i'm wondering what perspective you can add. the second question, vas, you said zolgensma potential was $2 billion. is that the first time novartis has provided that number? and what does that include for addressable sma patient groups as well as other indications? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, steve. on the inclisiran topic, it's been certainly a interesting journey for us as well. i mean, this is a situation where we had a facility, routine inspection would've happened in may.
due to the pandemic, the fda converted this to a paper-based inspection. the third party provided the documentation and the entire interaction has been purely based in writing. there have been no verbal conversations and these of course have happened in writing with -- with the third-party facility. our best estimates over the course of last year were based on our discussions with the review team and our understanding that there were no safety efficacy or cmc-related concerns that were product-specific.
we ultimately all learned and we did it as well with the crl that fda wanted additional documentation and some additional control changes within this facility. it's notable this facility is approved in our european medicines file, fully approved, and is part of the launch -- launch network for the launch of leqvio in -- in europe. we're working as fast as we can with the third party. ultimately, it's the third party's responsibility to provide answers to those questions to the fda.
i think we're trying to provide realistic guidance given that we're in a pandemic of q2 to q3 and then it will be up to the fda, ultimately, to determine if they still want an in-person inspection, when they want to conduct that inspection, and how long they take to complete that process and -- and review. i mean that's -- those are the facts as we know them and we'll continue to work as fast as we can to get the -- this medicine approved in the u.s. and launch. i think what's important is what marie-france and the team mentioned -- which she mentioned if anything this is an opportunity for us to prepare even better for the launch.
we don't have to launch this medicine in the midst of a -- of a pandemic. we have the opportunity now to build an even-stronger launch-preparedness effort and then hopefully get off to a strong start as soon as the product is -- is approved. with respect to zolgensma, i think historically we've said that we're comfortable with the 2025 consensus which i believe is in that range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. and so, that's the basis of -- of this -- of the comment that i made.
it's based on zolgensma iv and based on zolgensma iv in the current indications of under two years old in the u.s. and up to 22 kgs outside of the u.s. as i mentioned, we continue to work for -- to -- to get avxs-101 it fully licensed and we'll keep -- we'll give you an update once we clear the pre-clinical topic and we finalize the phase iii development program.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of graham parry, bank of america. please go ahead.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking my question. so, firstly a question on covid impacts on your '21 guide. so, roughly, how many percentage points do you think covid is negatively impacting revenue growth in 2021.
and on margins, how much wiggle room are you giving ourself there given the likelihood that you are going to get more covid savings. so, as we look into '22, you're really setting yourself up here for quite an easy base for '22 growth. and then secondly, question on canopy-1. it's been quite a lot of investor discussion around timing of interims.
i think some investors interpreted management comments made recently that there's definitely no interims in first half of '21. so, can you clarify if that's correct, or if you're just saying you're just not disclosing timing and just leave us guessing if it could happen any point between now and the final analysis in q4? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham. on covid-19 impact, i'll give it to harry. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
thank you very much, graham. so, very exact numbers are hard to grab, right, on what is purely covid. but as we compared to our forecast and of course then analytics around it which we're doing constantly, i would say starting with the -- the impact we ex -- we experienced in 2020 between 2% and 3% points of sales growth that we would attribute as a negative. on the bottom line, given the cost discipline as well as some of the natural underspend as we have -- as you have seen, we have made up more than that, you know, and it could even increase our core operating income guidance.
now, for 2021, a half-year effect. we have some little under 2% on the top line, what we expect. so, again, it depends very much on quarter two, quarter three goal. we have several scenarios which we tried to put here.
one, the guidance is never easy but i think we have to be a bit careful around when our patient visits and initiations back to pre-covid model which we do expect as of the summer as of q3. and then on the bottom line, i just want to mention one thing. as you know, and we had significant savings and underspend. of course, we keep our ways of working -- well, saving on travel and internal meetings and -- and so on, leveraging digital.
but we have -- we have basically put that into the base for '21 on the cost side. and now to assume we can do a significant effort like this again on top of already quite a lot of savings in -- in 2020, one has to be careful that we would not under-invest into the launches and pre-launches. so, we clearly see margin improvement but after 280-basis-points year in constant currencies, you know, to -- we have to also ensure the right level of investments as we expect the markets will open up for more face-to-face promotion also as of the summer.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and then on -- on interim guidance, maybe rather than giving specific on canopy-1, in general, we have interim data readouts across our programs. we were no longer disclosing the timing of those interim readouts. we'd rather have investors focus on the full-data readout -- full timing of data readouts based on the -- the powering of -- of these studies -- the power, of course, to read out, you know, at -- at the close of the study.
and so, we continue to guide to canopy-2 in the first half, canopy-1 in the second half, canopy adjuvant in -- in '22. thanks, graham. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. please go ahead. your line is open.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you very much. emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. a couple of questions, please. perhaps the first one if you take us on the shp2 just -- if you can give us a bit of clarity in terms of timing.
what we might see that first c-raf combination data on od and the clinics since q2 last year was, you know, partner in the u.s. monarche. so, just comment on timing and the degree of confidence you have based on the data you've presumably seen in-house that will have a major role to play in the future-targeted lung-therapy space. and then perhaps a second on the iptacopan -- iptacopan breakthrough designation and pnh, and c3g.
alexion has been historically quite clear they don't expect the oral complement assets to challenge c5 agents as the main stem of therapy rather -- or in, you know, refractory patients or those with breakthrough hemolysis. so, would you disagree with that view? was the breakthrough designation also covering naive patients or just the refractory subgroups, for example. and just a bit of thoughts in terms of the mid-term outlook in that space. and then maybe if i could just tack on in c3g.
we've had reasonably promising phase due to date from avacopan in the accolade early in december. company there is talking about potential for filing that would put you very significantly behind. so, just timings and indeed differentiation on that side of things as well would be helpful. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, emmanuel. so, on the shp2, john?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah, sure. thanks for the question, emmanuel. on the shp2 inhibitor, you know, we've been working with mirati and we have a clinical collaboration in terms of moving forward. there are couple of patients in combination with their c-raf g12c adagrasib.
we're beginning to see the initial results. i think there was one case study that was presented at an ontology conference at the end of the year last year. we hope that it reach proof of concept later this year and move forward based on those results. so, the exact timing in terms of the phase ii/phase iiis will be forthcoming and probably the mid -- this -- this time mid -- middle of this year is how we would move forward.
so, also, i think you had a number of questions regarding avacopan and i believe specifically you're asking about our approach with avacopan and pnh and combinations. as, you know, and just for the folks online here avacopans are first-in-class complement b -- factor b inhibitor that acts upstream of c3 and c5. and as alexion has their anti-c5, what we note is that we're targeting both intravascular hemolysis which is the c5 inhibitors which target the intravascular but we also target the c3. so, we know that about 70% of the patients currently who have pnh are inadequately controlled with c5 inhibitors.
so, we have designed a superiority trial in terms of moving forward in. so, we do feel like that would be a superiority trial that would give us the indication to move forward and send wage at.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then john, avacopan, and c3 -- c3 -- yeah, i think that's a c5 inhibitor. so, i think they're acting downstream the moment they can.
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
exactly that is downstream. and emmanuel, i think a third question on iga. if you could just ask that question because i didn't write down that specific third question.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
no, john. it was the -- that was a question on -- on timing of c3g and when we would plan to -- to get to a filing in c3g for avacopan.
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah. so, for -- for avacopan and c3g, what we've noted is that we have a phase ii data readout in the first half of this year. and based on that, we're looking to move forward in potential phase iii program and potential filing next year -- or 2023.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and i -- i just want to highlight again for avacopan, our -- our goal is a first-line -- a first-line indication. i think susanne and her team have a strong hematology presence in the u.s. so -- so, we believe we can launch this product successfully in first-line with respect to pnh. and then, of course, in the full range of indications and the -- in the coming year.
thank you for the -- the question. and next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard parkes from exane bnp. please go ahead. your line is open.
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. two questions. firstly, on kesimpta.
i just wondered to what degree the launch and the cost overall is being impacted by patients delaying treatment initiation due to either worries over immunosuppression or lack of -- potential lack of response to covid vaccination. i -- i've noticed a couple of recent complications underlying it. two times increased risk of severe covid would be so depleted. so, just wondered if you could comment on that and what degree that impacts on the c-raf might linger longer term as we come out of the pandemic.
and then secondly on entresto. just a clarification based on the patient populations that you're pointing to for the -- the present ejection fraction indication. it sounds like you -- you think the labeling discussions will be around kind of ejection fraction cutoffs rather than necessarily restricting by sex. so, just wondered if you can confirm that and if you are able to quantify what you think the opportunity for entresto is in the paradise-mi setting that would be really helpful.
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so, marie-france, both on kesimpta and entresto.
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so, on kesimpta, i think the important thing is that we're -- we're really leaving no stone unturned in this launch. and as i mentioned before, i think we're in pretty good shape on all our metrics to really bring this product as a first-line bmt to market. we are, however, feeling the effects of the pandemic and -- and you can see that mostly in the overall ability of our teams to perform their patient visits.
now, there is some noise in the market around vaccination or delaying hesitations by hcps on switching therapies. and -- and that's -- that is a -- -a reality that we're seeing right now. however, what i can say is that we are currently running some clinical trials in vaccinations. we also have data in this -- in this regard looking at other vaccinations and -- and b cell therapies and in other biologics that give us confidence that we'll be able to make sure that patients and physicians feel comfortable with using kesimpta in -- regardless of -- of covid and regardless of -- of vaccination.
so, there are currently a lot of real-world evidence, databases that are quite encouraging. we're looking at this not only for kesimpta but across a broad range of -- -of products including cosentyx as well. the important thing is that patients get treated. and despite the fact that our -- our selling cycle is a little longer, we're not slowing down.
we're continuing to build the foundation for this product. and i do believe that -- that you can expect to see the b cell market grow significantly not only because of the work that we're doing but because this is really bringing a high-efficacy therapy to patients upfront and that could radically change the way that physicians think about and -- and treat multiple sclerosis patients. so, we've said that we are ready, we just need this market to bounce back.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then, marie-france on the entresto hfpef ejection fraction versus male-female. and then also paradise-mi potential.
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
so, when -- when we go back to -- to what i said before, it really depends on the addressable pool of patients. we're very encouraged by the conversations that -- that we've heard coming out of the outcome. and now we're in discussions with fda around the exact wording of -- of the label. and it'll depend on the patient pool.
as i said before, this is a significant population but it's also an under-diagnosed population. so, we'll have to take things as it comes. it's very encouraging as we -- we have seen from -- from the -- the paragon data that there are groups of patients that do benefit. and there's a general consensus with physicians that -- that this is not an exact science.
so, having an ejection fraction below normal and looking at precise rates is not something that -- that -- that is an exact science. so, we're working to make sure that we can bring this product to the largest population possible and where it makes sense. and on ami, so we'll obviously have to wait for the side for -- for the -- for the results of the -- of the trials. but our data tells us there are -- there are about 7 million ami events every year across the globe and one in four will -- will develop heart failure.
so, in the u.s. alone, we're talking about 800,000 patients suffering from ami every year. and -- and these might benefit from entresto. so, we've got strong access for this product that we've built over the years.
we've got a great team and we, you know, we hope to bring entresto to -- to a -- a large incremental population if the results of the trial are positive.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, marie-france. thanks, richard. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes the line of simon baker, redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn partners -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. just two if i may, please. firstly, on the newer modalities. on zolgensma, vas, you gave us some details at the beginning on the countries you expect to add to reimbursement.
could you tell us the current number of countries where zolgensma is reimbursed.? and on kymriah, it was a particularly good performance in the fourth quarter against expectations. could you just give us some color on any pandemic disruption you've seen there and the extent to which that's been offset by the expanding footprint for kymriah that you discussed? and then finally a quick question on just eculizumab. could you give us the location of the manufacturer for the trial and commercial material that you will be using? thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. so, on -- thanks, simon. on -- on zolgensma, outside of the u.s., the -- of course, we have access in germany through the standard access pass there. we have reimbursement in japan and we're working very -- and we have a limited reimbursement program right now in a few other european countries particularly italy -- notably italy.
what we hope to be able to accomplish in the first half of this year is to establish reimbursement pathways in the u.k., italy, spain, canada, and a number of other markets. we'll see those -- those discussions as i mentioned have been a little delayed due to the pandemic. but we're hopeful we can accelerate them. and then on top of that, a key priority for us is to enable access in emerging markets, particularly turkey, brazil, but among other emerging markets as well where there are significant sma populations that could -- children who could benefit from zolgensma.
so, we hope to see a steady pace of getting reimbursement decision over the coming year. kymriah, susanne?
susanne schaffert -- president, novartis oncology
yeah. thank you, simon. so, i am -- we were really pleased with the performance of kymriah. it is also in q4, very strong growth, and this was really driven by double-digit growth across the geographies in the u.s., in europe, and japan and this despite covid.
i would say that that growth is partly driven by the expanding in new markets. as i said, there is now 27 markets that have reimbursements for at least one of the kymriah indications. the increased manufacturing capacity which means that we could serve all of the demand. and i have to say you were asking if there is impact from covid and yes there is because some treatment are delayed.
but on the other side, i think within the market, kymriah has performed exceptionally well. we have gained market share, and i think this is probably driven by the strong data that we, also in real-world evidence, could demonstrate that efficacy and also safety is even better than in the juliet trial. so, i think very, very strong and i think very safe product that would not require icu space, and i think this led probably to the decision by many centers to go for kymriah.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, susanne. and then on tislelizumab manufacturing, the product is produced by an established third party, european established third party. i'm not sure under our agreements what -- and given the ongoing review what i can and can't disclose.
i propose our ir team simply gets back to you once we do the appropriate checks, but a very reputable, top-class third-party manufacturer based out of europe.
simon baker -- redburn partners -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg. please go ahead. your line is open.
kerry holford -- head of global pharmaceutical equity research
thank you. yes, kerry holford from berenberg. a couple of questions left for me, please. firstly, on the beigene pd-1, i wonder if you can just talk through why you took the decision to bring that on board given you have spartalizumab, and what did that asset really offer that yours did not? was it just timing or is there something else here the world should be aware of? should we assume spartalizumab could now -- continue those ongoing combinations going to that asset as well? and then secondly on branaplam.
you highlighted in the slide phase iib is due to start in huntington's in the second half of the year. i wonder why not any earlier. is there covid-related delays, is there additional data preparation you need to do in the first half? and could that phase iib study be seen as a pivotal trial? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, kerry. on beigene, it does not change the status of our own pd-1. we view them as complementary.
our own pd-1 was primarily focused -- spartalizumab was focused on a few select indications. that was the strategy we took with that medicine. we'll continue on those indications. beigene has taken a very broad development program across the main pd-1 indications without overlap on spartalizumab, and so we're excited to bring that medicine to market across the full range of indications.
susanne, anything you'd want to add on this point?
susanne schaffert -- president, novartis oncology
yeah, vas. just to add, i think that really, we were impressed by the very broad development program that beigene is running in global programs, having really 15 potentially registration-enabling trials ongoing. and i believe for us also, advantage is that beigene has tested tislelizumab in very important indications in monotherapy that's different from spartalizumab like non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and so on. and therefore, we're excited to bring this product to market ex-china.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then, john, on branaplam timelines for huntington's.
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah, branaplam timelines. maybe, kerry, just one last item on the last question there is we also have a number of targeted therapies that we could use in combination. and if we have an approved pd-1, it actually fits very well in terms of a complementary portfolio. so, i think that's something that we thought about given timelines as you noted in the question.
specifically, on branaplam, as you highlighted, we will get the phase i results in the first half of this year. with those results, what we intend to do is take it to the health authorities and have discussions. and if timelines allow, we certainly will move as quickly as possible. if it's realistic, we will absolutely have a phase iib in the first half of this year.
but it really depends on the feedback from the health authorities because we will have to have discussions both with the fda as well as european agencies. so, your last question or the last part of that question was will this allow for a registrational study in phase iib. that really will also depend on the discussions that we have and as well as the data that we'll see in the phase i program. so, i think we'll be able to share more with you as we have these discussions and when we see the data.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. thanks, kerry. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of peter welford from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. yes, thanks for taking my questions. firstly, just going to another pipeline asset, iscalimab. wondering if you could just give us a bit of clarity on the path forward for filing of that now? i see a commentary that the regulatory interactions suggest that you can't file, based on kidney transplant -- sorry based on the ongoing study.
so, what is the planned timeline there? can you use liver and kidney together or is another trial started or planned to be started? and how do you think about that and what sort of endpoints the regulators are requiring? and then secondly, just on the generics. obviously, you're guiding toward no sandostatin gilenya generics during the course of this year, from harry, i guess makes sense on gilenya. i presume we're still going to wait for clarity from the court before you give us timing on that one. but sandostatin in the u.s., can you just give us some clarity on, i guess, what sort of research or visibility you have on that and sort of your confidence that we won't see a u.s.
sandostatin lar generic this year? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so, great. john, on iscalimab.
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah. thanks, peter. on iscalimab, this is our anti-cd40. as you know, we had intentions of moving forward, and we still have intentions of moving forward with two or three indications, renal transplant, liver transplant as well as sjogren's.
we took an aggressive clinical strategy given that there's really been no improvement or change of standard of care for renal transplant in 35 years other than calcineurin inhibitors. i think we noted previously in discussions, whether that was meet novartis management or other calls where we were using a digital endpoint, and we were having really good discussions with the agency on using this aggressive approach, using this digital endpoint. at the end of the year last year, they came back and they noted that they wanted to still use the same endpoint as previously which is bpar, biopsy-proven acute rejection. having that as feedback, we felt like we wanted to ensure that we have a path forward which would be a full phase iii, so -- which would be the same timelines as developing your traditional transplant drugs.
noting that, we do feel like there's also a potentially faster path through sjogren's, and we're awaiting the sjogren's phase iib result. and once we have those results, we'll be able to disclose the overall timelines on the sjogren's program which may be faster than the transplant program.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. on sandostatin lar generics in the u.s., susanne?
susanne schaffert -- president, novartis oncology
yeah, peter. i mean, as you know, there is one generic company that has achieved marketing authorization in europe and is doing a very targeted commercialization, currently being really commercialized only in eight markets, including germany, france, and u.k. our guidance for the u.s. is based on the fact that this same company has application running in the u.s.
since a while. we have no update at this point. but given also the situation, this covid, we expect that this process could take longer. but there is no concrete update and there is no new information.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, susanne. just a quick note for simon from redburn. we did a quick check and i can confirm that the tislelizumab is produced at the boehringer-ingelheim production site in shanghai. so, next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you. and first of all, vas, congratulations on the progress you've made on the esg front, especially with the access of medicine going up number two. now, kind of two questions for me, broad picture, please.
first, kind of your slide on the beigene collaboration suggests that you're open to a broader strategic collaboration with beigene. maybe i'm overinterpreting that sentence but would love to hear kind of what you are envisaging there. is this kind of a corporate collaboration? is it a collaboration from an oncology perspective? is this for novartis to sell stuff into china? why them for you to import innovation? just anything you can add to that would be great. and then secondly, as you look at kind of the bigger picture growth that you are suggesting, you are comfortable with consensus through to 2025 which is a 4% top-line growth.
to my mathematics, consensus has a 7%, 8% eps growth. if you aren't successful at delivering that, that would put you in the middle of or in line with your peer group. surely, your ambitions are bigger and higher than that. so, i was wondering if you might tell us what your kind of ambitions are and where you think you might actually get to.
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, keyur, and thanks for the comments as well on esg. we're very pleased with the collaboration with beigene in china and i think it fits with our broader goal to double the size of our chinese business. as i noted, we were one of the fastest-growing multinationals.
i noted all the nrdl listings and the upcoming approvals. we're continuing to explore partnership discussions with a number of local chinese players. i think specifically, beigene, of course, has a broader portfolio, has a strong oncology presence in china. and of course, we're looking forward to continuing a strong collaboration with them but also with other strong local chinese players as makes sense for our portfolio.
so, no specific plans or decisions, but i think more just to highlight that our ambitions in china are significant and we think we're on the right track with very strong teams across gdd and john's organization as well as marie-france and susanne's commercial teams. in terms of the mid to long-term ambitions, i think nothing more to add. of course, as a ceo who wants our company to lead and be the leading medicines company in the industry, i have very high ambitions. but i think more appropriate for me to keep those ambitions to myself and continue to simply say we're comfortable as we've stated with our sales and margin outlook from the consensus out to 2025.
and we'll do our best to deliver a world-class pipeline portfolio and execution across all five of our strategic priorities to get that. and then most important in my mind is to continue a strong growth trajectory beyond 2025 as well because we, of course, play this for the very long game. thanks, keyur. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
emily hutchinson -- citi -- analyst
hi, there. emily hutchinson from citi on behalf of andrew baum. just one question, please. on cosentyx, can you talk to the anticipated performance in the u.s.
in 2021 given i note exclusion from a couple of national formularies? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, emily. and this is the longest i've ever gone in an ir call in this role without a cosentyx question. so, marie-france, on cosentyx.
marie-france tschudin -- president, novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah, i'm very happy to get at least one question on cosentyx. so, the first thing i'd say is i really need to put this in perspective because our overall access position in the u.s. remains incredibly strong. in fact, you heard me say that before; early line access is a key pillar to our strategy.
however, we're always going to balance access with long-term sustainability for cosentyx, and you can expect us to continue to do that. now, specifically on the esi decision which is what you're referring to, you can obviously expect to see some impact on volume from this account, and that will also be reflected in our nbrx share. but know that we're confident in our ability to grow cosentyx based on our three strategic pillars. we talked about access, we talked about the competitive product profile across four indications.
and then very importantly, our lifecycle management opportunities that could bring us to six indications in the future. so, we've consistently delivered double-digit growth despite the competition and despite the fact that there is a lot going on in this market, and you'll see us do that again in 2021. these access decisions are short-term decisions. it's not going to change the long-term trajectory for cosentyx or our ability to reach $5 billion and beyond.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. i'd ask the next set of analysts to please limit themselves to one question just in the interest of time. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim. please go ahead. your line is open.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks very much. so, really just wanted to get an update on iscalimab in sjogren's disease. i think previously, you had stated that you were planning for either an interim toward the end of this year or perhaps even a final look at those data. so, just wanted to get an update on iscalimab in sjogren's disease.
and maybe if you could just give us a little color on the ability to recruit patients or continue recruiting patients into that study. if recruitment is completed, then obviously that question is irrelevant. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
john, on iscalimab?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah. on iscalimab, thanks for the question, seamus. as vas disclosed earlier, we're really not disclosing the interims moving forward. so, as we're moving forward, the recruitment has been a little bit slower than we anticipated.
we're not fully recruited in the phase iib for iscalimab yet. so, the recruitment continues and those timelines really will depend on when we finish recruitment. so, we'll provide further updates in terms of the exact timing of completion of that trial.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard vosser from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
richard vosser -- j.p, morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. a question on zolgensma and the intrathecal form. just could you give us some help on the design of the pivotal trial? would you look to broaden the age range beyond the two to five years which was the original, i suppose, strong trial design? and given the thoughts on what's happened to other gene therapies, what do you think the regulators would need in terms of duration, durability to see particularly in, i suppose, type-2 sma patients? thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. so, we're in discussions now with fda on finalizing that clinical trial design. i think the discussions are very positive both on dose and duration, but we haven't finalized the design.
hopefully, by q1, we'll be able to give you at least a perspective on what the agreed design of the study is, assuming we get off clinical hold later on in the year. so, still more to come and we'll keep you posted. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of florent cespedes from societe generale. please go ahead. your line is open.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you very much for taking my question. a quick one for richard on sandoz. could you please share with us how do you see the dynamic of the non-biosimilar business because we understand what is driving this business, but for the rest of the portfolio it's a bit more difficult to understand? could you maybe elaborate on this on mid-term dynamic of the non-biosimilar business? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
richard? see if we saw richard? richard, are you on the line?
operator
richard's line is still connected.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
no, i think --
operator
sorry, sir.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
richard's line is still connected.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
ok. well, i'll just quickly answer the question. i think the dynamics we see right now in biosimilars, primarily growth in europe and japan. in the u.s., it continues to be a mixed picture.
of course, hopeful that with our next wave of assets we can get a much broader set of assets launched in the u.s. with 15 projects now progressing through our biosimilars portfolio. in terms of small molecules, the softness we saw was primarily in anti-infectives in europe as well as the legacy -- the oral solids business we brought back from aurobindo. what we're hopeful now is that hopefully, we see demand start to pick up again over the course of this year.
but much more important is revitalizing our pipeline and revitalizing our first-to-file engine in the u.s. and being at market formation in europe. we think the combination of those two pillars, the biosimilars pipeline, and the first-to-file pipeline should get us to that mid-single-digit growth rate over time.
richard saynor -- chief executive officer, sandoz
thanks, vas. i shouldn't press my mute button.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
all right. next question, operator? i think we have just a few more left.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of naresh chouhan from intron. please go ahead. your line is open.
naresh chouhan -- founder, intron health
hi there. thanks for taking my questions. just one on m&a, please. you've had a couple of large deals which have resulted in some issues where we're arguing that those assets were developed internally.
the likelihood of those problems arising would've been probably much less likely to have occurred. i'm thinking the avexis data integrity issues, the leqvio cdmo issues. and given that even the most diligent acquirers would've been probably unlikely to have found those issues, does it dim your enthusiasm for future deals of this size given the risks involved? and if i may, just does the $60 billion sales number include m&a or is that just organic growth? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, naresh. on the second part, just organic growth. we're not including m&a.
i think less about -- i mean, look, i think when we go into new technology areas which we believe we need to do in the long run to be a leader, to be competitive to drive growth, we are going to learn new things. i think certainly, the fact that we are doing small interfering rna and novel gene therapies is part of the reason we have some of the challenges that we do. but i would say it's less about that and more -- we have enough on our plate with a full internal pipeline. we've done a number of deals which we're currently working on fully scaling.
we have four platforms we want to get to global leadership on, so we have plenty to do. always opportunistically thinking about m&a, but that's not in focus at the moment. we want to execute on the strategy and plan we have ahead of us and that's where we're focused on at the moment. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emily field from barclays. please go ahead.
emily field -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i just had a quick question on 2021 and the impact of taking on tislelizumab. i was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the order of magnitude of the incremental development costs that you'll be taking on with this asset.
and is that mostly coming from r&d and the initiation of these combination trials? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. harry, you want to provide some color on that or clarity on that?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah, thank you. so, it's a bit complicated. but first of all, we do account for the appropriate, if you will, share of development costs of the current registration trials in our core p&l. it's about one point of core operating income growth, if you will, from a dilution standpoint.
but it will not be a cash expense because the current portfolio is being executed by beigene and it's part of our upfront payment. so, it's not a cash expense but an expense given the structure of the deal. we always want to ensure that our core results and the core accounting is of the highest quality as well.
emily field -- barclays -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. last question, operator?
operator
thank you. your last question today comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
well, thank you for taking my follow-up. vas, there's just another clarification, investor question actually on tislelizumab. the question was the 15 registration trials that susanne mentioned. i'm being asked which of those -- which regions and in which indications are you going to be able to file? so, i guess the question is really reflecting if you need any additional data in a specific country such as the u.s.
or parts of europe in any specific indications. thank you for the follow-up.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, mark. so, i'll just quickly take it. we have rights in u.s., europe, and a number of other ex-u.s.
markets. beigene keeps rights in parts of asia and latin america. the clinical trial portfolio -- clinical trials currently being conducted are already conducted with support filings in a full range of indications, so second-line lung which they hope to complete this year, first-line lung, colorectal cancer, head, and neck. susanne, are there others that i'm missing?
susanne schaffert -- president, novartis oncology
no, i think gastric is also there. yeah, head and neck you mentioned. and, i mean, these are global programs; that's probably worth to mention. they're enrolling not only chinese patients but also from other geographies.
and i think what is important in this setting that the comparator is strong. and for example, we are excited about the second line data in non-small cell lung cancer; beigene reported very strong overall survival data versus doce. so, i think that's how you have to see this, that the clinical program, we believe, is very robust and would allow for filings ex-u.s. -- sorry, ex-china.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark. and thanks everyone for joining today's call. we appreciate your interest in our company as well as all the investors, i appreciate your support of novartis. and we'll look forward to keeping you up to speed over the course of this year.
please stay healthy and thank you again.

2021-Q1,NVS,2021-04-27 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q1 2021 results release conference call and live audio webcast. please note that during the presentation, all participants will be on a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call including the q&a session will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. [operator instructions] with that, i would like to hand it over to mr.
samir shah, global head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much, and good morning and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for taking the time to join us on the q1 results conference call. we appreciate that you're taking your time. before we start, i just want to go through the safe harbor statement.
the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. these may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f and its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that respectively were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission.
and with that, i'll now hand it across to vas. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir. and thanks again to everyone for joining today's conference call. with me today, i have harry kirsch, our chief financial officer; marie-france tschudin, our president of novartis pharmaceuticals; susanne schaffert, our president of novartis oncology; john tsai, our head of global drug development and chief medical officer; richard saynor, our head of sandoz; tom kendris who is our chief legal officer ad interim; and samir who you just heard from. so moving to the next slide.
what i'd like to do is give you an overview of our performance and then dive a little bit deeper into the four key areas as part of the overview section before handing it over to our business leaders. first and foremost, we feel confident in the growth outlook of the company particularly given the momentum we're seeing in innovative medicines and the expected stabilization we foresee in the sandoz business. from a productivity standpoint, when you control for -- forward purchasing we continued the expansion of our core margin and i'll say more about that in a moment. we had multiple important milestones from an innovation standpoint, and i'll go into a little more depth as to some of the upcoming milestones and some of the updates we have in our phase 2 and phase 3 pipeline, which we view as one of the leading pipelines in the industry.
and lastly, in esg, we continue to our march to being a sector leader within the pharmaceutical and bio biopharmaceutical sector as well as being a leader across sectors, ranked no. 2 in the access to medicine index and no. 1 in sustainalytics, and i'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. so going to the next slide, starting with the growth outlook.
our key growth drivers really demonstrated that they're returning to momentum over q1. we had strong performance brands such as entresto, zolgensma, and cosentyx on the pharmaceutical side, as well as a very good performance from brands like lutathera, kymriah, and solid performance from kisqali on the oncology side. in addition, kesimpta is up to a very strong start and marie-france will talk more about these, the kesimpta launch. then when you take it together, our key growth drivers and launches, we're growing 20% and amounting to 48% of our total sales.
and we expect this number to continue to climb over the coming years, enabling us to deliver the mid-term growth we outlined in the mid to march -- to novartis management presentation we had last november. as a proof point, when you exclude forward purchasing, our innovative medicines business grew 3% in the quarter in constant currencies. and moving to the next slide, we're also confident that we can continue to deliver the core margin expansion that we've committed to. in the near term that would be in the mid to high 30s, in the near term, excuse me, in the midterm, it would be in the high 30s.
and when you look at our q1 underlying performance when, again, you take into account forward purchasing that we saw last year, the core operating growth is plus 6% and core margin growth of a point bringing us to 36.3%, well on our way to getting to that high 30s goal. the drivers of that expansion were sales momentum on our key -- on our key products as well as the continued productivity program in novartis technical operations where our goal is to deliver $2 billion in savings in the next few years. and we continue to evolve our ways of working, delivering savings from our newly created customer technology solutions organization, which integrates data and digital as well as novartis business services to even accelerate the overall way of working inside of novartis. moving to slide 8.
sandoz did have a difficult quarter, which was impacted by price erosion as forward purchasing and a historically low cost in the cold season. the first thing to note is we were cycling an exceptionally strong prior-year quarter and you can see some of the figures here. but for example, the total sales of sandoz were up 11% in q1 2020 and of course, this quarter was down 13%. now some of the underlying factors that we see impacting this, many of them are sectorwide price erosion of 10% which we saw across europe and the u.s.
in our key markets. i mentioned the forward purchasing as well as weak demand and cough and cold retail as well as some of the impacts of the retention of the aurobindo business in oral solid in the -- in the u.s. on a positive note, our biopharma business continues to grow and continues to be a leader in many regions around the world. we expect business -- the business to stabilize in the second half as the pandemic eases.
we expect -- expect our biosimilars to outperform in the competitive european market. we expect to see our retail european business rebound and we also have an increasing number of launches both across biosimilars in geographies outside of the u.s. and europe as well as in small molecules in the second half. so that'll be a key area of focus for us as we continue to get sandoz back to growth.
moving to slide 9. from a pipeline and innovation standpoint, it was a busy quarter. you're well aware of the approval of entresto in patients with a below-normal left ventricular ejection fraction update to cosentyx label and approvals in kesimpta. in terms of readouts, the division study readout positive on both radio -- pfs -- rpfs as well as on overall survival.
we look forward to presenting that impressive data at an upcoming medical congress. we had the positive readout of cosentyx in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which we now are moving toward filing and we'll continue to enable us to expand cosentyx indication where we have a goal getting to nine indications or formulations to enable cosentyx to drive -- to continue to drive dynamic growth over this decade. lnp iptacopan had a positive readout in iga nephropathy and we'll look forward to presenting that data in the upcoming congress. we've already initiated the phase 3 program.
you'll remember that iga nephropathy is one of the larger indications we have for this medicine. we also had the positive readout, which has already stated in pnh and the phase we started there. and we're expecting additional results, which we'll talk about in a moment. we did have the results of entresto in the post-ami setting where it had a high hurdle trying to demonstrate superiority to ramipril in a very fragile patient population.
these are patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction. entresto had a consistent positive trend across all the primary and secondary endpoints but did not meet statistical significance for superiority, it did demonstrate a very strong safety profile and we'll look forward to discussing the data further with -- with regulators in the months to come. and lastly, you're aware of the canakinumab second line readout. so some other designations and submissions in the bottom of the slide.
but i'd like to move to the next slide and take a little bit of time to go through some of the updates on our expected milestones across our -- our key programs in lifecycle management pharmaceuticals and -- and oncology. i already mentioned the entresto and consentyx information, we are -- on consentyx we are on track for the hidradenitis suppurativa phase 3 readouts in the second half of 2021. in kisqali, importantly, we have completed enrollment of the agilent study in medium and high-risk patients, richard saynor will say a bit more about that with the readout in 2022. with respect to leqvio, we remain on track for a crl response to be submitted in the q2, q3 timeframe.
we've also completed a tech transfer into our schaftenau facility in austria and are evaluating the best way to submit that response now with the fda. and -- and i think those are some of the key highlights on lifecycle management. now turning to the pharmaceuticals portfolio, i've already mentioned on lnp023 some of the key milestones. but i -- i think the key thing here is that we're continuing to rapidly move across a broad range of indications into phase 3.
the other highlight i wanted to mention is branaplam where we have completed the phase 1 study and we look forward to providing that information in the upcoming medical congress. we have also completed discussions with regulators to finalize the phase 2b study design and plan to start that study in the second half of 2021. and then moving to oncology. i think it's very important the canakinumab studies remain on track in the first line in agilent.
but as important in many ways now the lu-psma study studies in the early lines of therapy and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is -- have -- have begun and we look forward to enrolling the studies rapidly with a plan readout in 2024. now, moving to the next slide. you probably will have seen that we've completed the -- our in-licensing agreement for tislelizumab with beijing. and we did have the readout of two important readout -- studies that will enable submissions over the course of this year.
first and second-line non-small cell lung cancer at aacr. you can see the data here on the right with solid overall survival data. and then also in esophageal cancer, where the study is met -- met is primary endpoint prolonging os versus chemo and we'll provide that data release as well in the upcoming congress. so these -- these studies will enable ex-china filings, which are on track for 2021 and we have 15 potential registration enabling studies ongoing as well as a broad range of combination studies in the program.
then moving to the next slide. i wanted to close just by noting our -- our commitment across the company in areas of high materiality for novartis to advance our efforts in esg in returning and building trust with society. i mentioned the ranking we have now on sustainalytics, we're the only company among our peers that now ranked with low risk in the sustainalytics ranking. also, in access to medicine index, the no.
2 ranking. but we were very proud of our no. 1 ranking in product delivery, our ability to bring our innovative medicines to patients most in need in low and low-middle-income countries. other highlights include an agreement with bill and melinda gates foundation on bringing transformative therapies to patients in sickle cell disease as well as being included in the bloomberg gender-equality index.
and of course, you're aware of our ongoing efforts in covid-19 to provide our manufacturing capacity as well as to collaborate with molecular partners as well as our own in-house oral programs for covid, our oral protease inhibitor to hopefully bring therapeutics overtime to help with the long-term control of covid-19. so that gives you a little bit of an overview. i'd like to hand it over now to marie-france to dive a little bit deeper into pharmaceuticals. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
thank you, vas. good morning, good afternoon. i'm pleased to update you on our q1 performance for pharma. we had revenues of $6.3 billion this quarter and while the overall growth rate was affected versus q1 2020, our growth drivers and launches are showing excellent momentum with 23% growth versus the prior year.
what is noteworthy is that half of our revenues are now coming from our growth drivers and launches. this is the result of clear portfolio prioritization and a relentless focus on commercial execution. we've -- we've also doubled down on early launch preparation and our investments reflect that. if we move to slide 15, cosentyx, our largest brand delivered double-digit growth.
as we said in q4, we've seen an access change in one u.s. account which has impacted volumes. although the shares were affected, we will continue to deliver double-digit growth in the u.s. based on the rebate upside realized and the volume growth over time.
our overall access remains strong in the u.s. and continues to be a key pillar of our strategy. the other constant is that customers continue to experience cosentyx as a tried and trusted complete treatment. now that the shares have adjusted to the new access levels, we are back to our position that we will grow with the market in dermatology and outgrow the market in rheumatology.
in the u.s., our focus is on accelerating volume growth. we're off to a great start in china following our nrdl listing in march. in europe, cosentyx continues to be the leading originator biologic across all three indications. as we bring the newer indications to market.
we expect some pricing concessions in europe and that will only further enable volume-driven growth. the full year, we're confident that the cosentyx team can deliver double-digit growth based on our strategic pillars, focus on strong access globally, geographic expansion, and our leading industry approach to data. beyond 2021, our ambitious lifecycle program provides further upside opportunities for the future. slide 16.  entresto is doing extremely well with strong growth across the globe.
in the u.s., we're seeing a convergence of events. physicians are adopting the atc expert consensus recommendations for entresto in the first line. we're seeing recovery from covid and enthusiasm around the expanded indication. it's great to see the growing confidence to go direct to arni, which is reflective of the strong evidence behind and entresto.
we're seeing all-time highs in nbrx. the label in the u.s. now covers five out of six patients with chronic heart failure and this makes it easy for physicians to initiate appropriate patients. we now estimate that about 3.2 million patients are being treated with entresto today.
this is a big achievement and is a testament to the exquisite execution of the teams in the field. we now have a 30% share of the hfref patients in the u.s. so there remains significant room to grow as 70% of ref patients are still on the prior standard of care and we've only just started to promote in the ref population. if i move to slide 17, zolgensma had a strong quarter, which was driven by reimbursement wins in a number of european markets while the u.s.
continued its steady trend. as every eu country initially has both patients and then moves into a steady state, you can expect to see some volatility in the quarterly sales pattern. we have new compelling data on zolgensma's efficacy in the pre-symptomatic patient. we're also initiating a new phase 3 trial called smart to strengthen the confidence of children up to 21 kilograms in the eu.
we're on track with our preclinical studies for the it formulation, which would also allow us to bring zolgensma to older children. our five-year durability data confirmed what is this medicine can offer in one single treatment. and this is what really sets zolgensma apart and why we are relentlessly progressing our gene therapy agenda with two more inds plan this year. if we move to slide 18, with kesimpta, we're bringing a high efficacy b-cell therapy to patients early in their disease.
our new pira data builds on the strong efficacy profile already shown in our pivotal trials. kesimpta can reduce disease progression that happens independent of relapses by up to 60% when used early. we believe this is incredibly meaningful data for patients because pira actually accounts for the majority of progression, the state is unique in this early patient population. while the pandemic is still impacting the dynamic market and the prescribing behavior, all the metrics that are in our control are tracking positively.
we're seeing more than 50% use in the first line for a switch, which is exactly aligned to our value proposition. the team has also done a great job on access. in fact, the conversion from the free-to-paid product is ahead of plan. this is reflected in the q1 numbers, which also include a $9 million revenue adjustment relating to q4 2020 and why we now expect 65% of sales in the second half of the year.
recent data also shows that the igg levels of patients on kesimpta are maintained over time, which is important to fight infections including covered and reinforces our safety profile. once the market bounces back, we expect strong uptake for this product based on the compelling product profile and the growing evidence base behind the brand. remember that we designed this brand specifically for multiple sclerosis. as you can see from the data, we are achieving sustained depletion with monthly dosing and we're not seeing a rebound between doses.
with a high and sustained efficacy and the opportunity for at-home treatment, kesimpta has what it takes to fundamentally change how we treat multiple sclerosis. slide 19. leqvio was launched in germany and austria in february in the limited population of patients at very high cardiovascular risk. physicians seem happy with the immediate drop they see in ldl-c levels and with the ability to have the sustaining effect with only two injections per year.
in europe, we need the outcomes data, which we expect in 2026. so in the meantime, we want to advance discussions on population health approaches as our goal is to bring this medicine to a broad population as quickly as possible and this way significantly lower the burden of ascvd on patients and systems. the u.k. nhs agreement is our first such agreement and is on track for launch in q3, more to come.
in the u.s., we're on track to resubmit our file in q2, q3. while we're preparing our filing, we're also actively engaging with a large number of u.s. healthcare systems to lay the foundation for broad uptake.in summary, we continue to focus on executing our strategy, maximizing our growth drivers, delivering our launches, preparing our next big best. our growth drivers are doing very well.
our launches are gaining momentum. now, these accounts for half our sales. as we see a more dynamic market environment, we will continue to accelerate our portfolio shift and double down on patient hcp and healthcare system engagement in order to enable access to more patients faster. i want to thank the teams around the world who worked so hard to achieve this every day.
over to susanne.
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
thank you. marie-france. so let's move to slide 21. our oncology business has delivered solid performance in the first quarter.
its net sales of $3.8 billion broadly in line with the previous year. our key growth drivers continue to perform well including kymriah, kisqali, promacta/revolade, and jakavi. both our growth brands and recent launches together grew 15% versus the previous year and contributed to almost half of the overall oncology sales, allowing us to more than compensate for the continued generic erosion of afinitor and exjade/jadenu in the u.s. and sandostatin lar in the eu.
the first quarter was marked by the continued impact of the pandemic on certain segments of our portfolio with a more pronounced effect on hospital-initiated therapies, our breast cancer portfolio, and recent launches. due to the pandemic, patients did not see their physicians at the same frequency in diagnosis, and treatment initiations remained below pre-pandemic levels. however, we remain confident that patient visits to hospitals will resume and treatment patterns will normalize leading to acceleration of growth in these segments. moving to slide 22, just to remind you that we are the only pharmaceutical company which is pursuing four different cancer treatment platforms.
these include radioligand therapy, cell and gene therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy with an opportunity to combine these platforms for better outcomes. today, i wanted to especially reflect on our progress, this radioligand therapies. since the acquisition of aaa in 2018, we have established strong global expertise in commercializing radioligand therapies, supported by a specialized supply chain-manufacturing capabilities across for radioligand therapy production sites. with lutathera, our radioligand therapy for neuroendocrine tumors, we have gained a lot of momentum and in partnership with now 400 centers.
we are able to deliver this life-saving treatment to more than 9,000 patients since launch. we have generated a unique skill set and experience in manufacturing, supply, and commercialization of radioligand therapies, and we will leverage these to maximize the potential of our future launches in this space. on the development side, we're advancing four clinical programs and around 11 preclinical and discovery programs to identify the next wave of radioligand therapies for cancer. we continue to invest in our radioligand pipeline through the in-licenses of a library of fibroblast-activating protein or fat-targeting agents.
the investment into active oncology for development of alpha-based radioligand therapies and our most recent collaboration with artios pharma to discover and identify novel combinations of dna damage response inhibitors with rsgs. moving to slide 23, earlier in march, we're very excited to share with you data from the vision study with lu-psma in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and the trial met both primary endpoints of improved overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival versus standard of care. just to remind you, prostate cancer is the second-most diagnosed cancer globally. and in the majority of cases, patients, unfortunately, develop metastases by the time of castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis.
there is a significant unmet medical need in this population with a five-year survival rate of approximately 15%, and they have very limited treatment options. the vision study findings confirm that lu-psma has the potential to become the targeted treatment for more than 80% of men with late-stage advanced prostate cancer. we intend to initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and prepare submissions to the fda and ema by the end of this year. on the commercial side, we are effectively preparing for the upcoming launch with a focus on hospital and community centers.
more than 70% of prostate cancer patients are treated here. given the prevalence of the disease, we are working with treatment centers to better understand their operational needs for capacity expansion in order to administer targeted radioligand therapies. additionally, we are raising awareness on the clinical relevance of psma and the potential value of targeted rsgs as a new mechanism of action in advanced prostate cancer. on the development side, the vision trial findings are supporting our confidence in moving into earlier lines of advanced prostate cancer.
we are planning a phase 3 study with lu-psma in the pre-taxane metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting and in the metastatic hormone-sensitive setting. we anticipate that both of these studies will start in the first half of 2021. moving to slide 24, kisqali delivered a solid performance in the first quarter with sales up 19% reaching $195 million, driven by unprecedented overall survival benefit from two pivotal phase 3 trials. we are very pleased to see kisqali continue to grow strongly and gaining market share ex-u.s., especially on european markets.
in the u.s., kisqali maintains share despite the overall slowdown of the cdk4/6 market, driven by the suppressed diagnostics rate and overall degrees in new patient starts. we believe kisqali has a unique profile, supported by the longest-reported median os among all phase 3 trials in advanced breast cancer reaching around five years in premenopausal patients. therefore, we remain confident in the longer-term potential of kisqali. on the development side, natalee adjuvant study in intermediate and high-risk population has completed enrollment ahead of plan, and we are on track for final readout in 2022.
so, overall, we are confident with kisqali resilient performance in what continues to be a challenging market environment. and with that, let me hand it over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
thank you, susanne. good morning and good afternoon, everyone. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the first quarter, as well as provide you with an update on our '21 guidance. as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless otherwise noted.
so, slide 26 shows a summary of our operational performance for the first quarter. as we indicated at the start of the year, quarter one growth was negatively impacted by prior-year quarter one forward purchasing which amounted to around minus 3% points on sales and minus 7% points on core operating income. this quarter also still had a continued demand impact for covid-19, particularly at dermatology, ophthalmology. our breast cancer portfolio and for the sandoz retail and anti-infectives businesses.
free cash flow was impacted this quarter by the $650 million upfront payment for tislelizumab in-licensing from beigene. i would give more detail about free cash flow later in the presentation. with these caveats, you can see the changes in net sales and core operating income, minus two points and minus eight points, respectively, which flowed out into eps and free cash flow. turning to slide 27, we have shown the change with the prior year for sales core operating income and core margins in the first quarter as reported on the left-hand side of this table.
on the right-hand side, as we did a similar chart last year quarter one, we have illustrated what the underlying operational performance looks like if we excluded the prior-year forward purchasing. innovative medicines had a solid underlying performance. sales grew plus 3%, core operating income plus 6%, and core margin was up plus 1% point. innovative medicines' performance was driven by continued strong double-digit growth of all the key growth drivers like entresto, zolgensma, cosentyx.
and our oncology growth drivers, partly offset by mature product declines and generic erosion. for sandoz, we would still have seen a challenging quarter. excluding prior-year forward purchasing, sandoz's sales were still down minus 9% and core operating income was down minus 29%. as vas explained earlier, some of the key challenges for sandoz were the pricing impact, and historically low cough-and-cold season, and softer retail demand as a result of covid.
at the group level, underlying performance adds up to plus 1% of sales, and core operating income declined minus 1%. let's now go to slide 28. one way of better understanding the underlying performance, given the distortions caused by covid over the last year, is to compare to what you could call a normal first quarter in 2019 with quarter one 2021. on this slide, we have showed what happens to group and innovative medicines over the last three quarter ones for both top and bottom line.
we show the cagr for both and you can see that for group sales, cagr was a solid plus 5% and core operating income cagr was plus 11%. this is clearly driven by innovative medicines with the top line growing at a 7% cagr and the bottom line even at 13% cagr, which shows the strong operational performance of our innovative medicines division. innovative medicines' core margin increased by 300 basis points over the two years was the result of our good top-line growth, combined with very good progress on productivity programs. on slide 29, you can see that free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion.
the most significant reason as mentioned for this decrease was the $650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from beigene and lower operating income adjusted for non-cash items, partly offset by favorable changes in working capital. now, turning to our full-year 2021 guidance on slide 30. we confirmed full-year guidance both for group and innovative medicines for sales and core operating income. for innovative medicines, we continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth in 2021.
for sandoz, reflecting the start of the year, we now expect sales to decline low to mid-single-digit revised downwards from the prior proudly in-line guidance for sandoz. now, as an exception to our regular guidance format and due to the impact covid had on sandoz's quarter one results, we're also going to provide for this year the breakdown of core operating income guidance by division. we expect innovative medicines' core operating income to grow mid to high-single digits ahead of sales. and for sandoz, we expect core operating income to decline low to mid-teens.
the key assumption for this guidance remains that we see a return to normal global healthcare systems and prescribing dynamics by mid-2021. and in addition, we continue to assume that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics enter in 2021 in the u.s. turning now to my last slide, several of you asked for a bit more detail on quarterly saving. on slide 31, i've tried to explain the dynamics that we expect to see in quarter two and for the full year, given the impact on covid -- of covid both in 2020 and '21.
as you recall, at the start of the year, we guided to expect quarter one sales to decline low to mid-single digits. and underlying sales, excluding prior-year forward purchasing to be proudly in line with prior year. this was the case, and as already explained, sales excluding prior-year forward purchasing grew plus 1% on quarter one. for quarter two, we expect sales to grow mid-single digits benefiting from approximately plus 3% points of prior-year forward purchasing reversal.
for core operating income, in the first half of 2021, we expect it to decline low-single digits due to prior-year, lower-cost base, and investments in quarter two of 2021 to support the second-half growth. in summary, quarter one showed a solid underlying performance for innovative medicines, challenging for sandoz but allowed us to reconfirm our full-year guidance. in quarter two, we expect to benefit from the reversal of forward purchasing and some improved momentum in the u.s., given the speed of vaccinations in that key market. our current and expected performance also allows us to reiterate our confidence that we will grow top and bottom line every year to 2025 and meet external expectations.
and with that, i'll hand it back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thank you, harry. i wanted to highlight before closing that we do have a catalyst-rich period coming up for the remainder of this year. a number of submissions, as you see here on the chart, a -- a number of important readouts that would enable submissions either this year or next year.
so, we'll look forward to keeping you up to date on these readouts as they happen over the course of this year and also present the data at major congresses. so, moving to the next slide and in closing, i think you've heard now from all of us that we have confidence in our growth drivers and launches to continue their strong momentum. you've seen that underlying performance is starting to come through and momentum is picking up. solid im top and bottom-line performance and even when you take into account the prior-year purchasing, you really see the underlying performance come through.
our broad pipeline of novel medicines in phase 2 and phase 3 continue to progress well and we're confident in delivering our 2021, and more importantly, our longer-term top and bottom-line growth outlook. so, with that, operator, we can open the line for questions. i would ask questioners to limit yourself to two questions as we have a -- a lot of people in the queue. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much for taking my questions. so, one on cardiovascular outcomes studies, one on kesimpta piece. in terms of the orion-4 study, i -- i just wondered if there's anything more you can say about the delay from december 24 to 2026.
and whether, given you're still recruiting patients, this study i think is run by oxford university where there's the options to add more patients to try and expedite the readout. the reason why i asked is that there's been a recent update for tqj230 and the horizon study is still on track to complete in march 2024. so, i'm not sure what's unusual or otherwise about orion-4. and then secondly on -- on kesimpta, marie-france, one for you.
could you help us understand the -- the latest nbrx share trends in the united states? and as the sort of patient flow comes back and your promotion there responds in kind, where do you feel the nbrx share should evolve during the course of this year? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, mark. so, john, do you want to take the cv outcomes study?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
sure. will do. thanks, mark. thanks for the question on adakveo.
as we noted in meet novartis management last year at the end of the year that our expectations for adakveo at that time was conclusion in 2025. we've seen a pretty significant impact, as you know, we're doing this study with -- with the oxford group where the majority of our patients are recruited from the u.k. and as we've seen both with covid and then the additional variants with the impact of covid in the u.k., recruitment has been challenging. initially in december as we saw, there was an uptick in covid cases in the u.k.
and then subsequently, throughout the first quarter of the year in the u.k., there was a significant impact of covid. so, based on the recruitment timelines, we actually have deferred the study results to 2026. because during that time, i think the healthcare systems were overwhelmed with taking care of covid patients, so it was very difficult to recruit these patients. as we've had discussions with the oxford group, i think recruitment is starting to tick back on track and we're working very closely in terms of a report -- report out of the results in 2026.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank -- thanks, john. just one additional note. across other studies like tqj where we had a global footprint, we've been able to flex our recruitment around the world to maintain timelines. in this particular study, we've been given a high proportion of patients in the u.k.
nhs, so this was a -- a bigger impact. we, of course, look at all ways to expedite the -- the study in the meantime. on kesimpta, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so, thanks for the question. the first thing to note is that our -- our u.s. launch is progressing really well.
and as i said in my opening remarks, the areas that are under our control are -- are progressing really well. we talk about positioning, we talked about the first line, first switch at 50%, ease of initiation which was very important for us, and access where we already have 75% of commercial lives covered. so, based on that, we -- we saw that paid product is going faster than expected. and we're also looking at 65% of sales in the second half of the year, previously we had said 75%.
if i pivot to nbrx, we're currently at 10%. but as you know, the dynamic market is still suppressed, and we see hesitations to switch patients or to initiate patients on b cell therapies prior to vaccinations. as the market bounces back and as we see vaccination campaigns progress, i believe that we'll -- we'll see a significant uplift in the nbrxes for kesimpta. we're also bringing in additional markets or kesimpta to additional markets and can also expect strong uptake based on the efficacy.
as we said, you know, we talk about one relapse every nine to 10 patient years. and now, we've got additional evidence that shows that kesimpta reduces risk of progression independent of relapses by up to 60% in naive patients. so, all of this points to a tremendous opportunity for -- for patients and for this product. we're also very confident that we'll see a -- a big expansion in the b cell market.
so, currently, we see around 30% in the u.s. and we expect that number to get to 50% over the next couple of years.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. next -- next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of graham parry from bank of america.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so, another one on kesimpta [inaudible] and the free versus paid-for. i think you previously said it was around 30% paid for you're aiming to get that to 70% by the end of the year.
so, if you could just give us an update on where you are now and where you expect that to be at the end of the year that drives the -- the 65% number. and then secondly on sandoz, just -- you talked about stabilization in the second half of the year. but some -- if, you know, margins are down largely because of price, is there a risk this does -- just doesn't reverse thereafter. so, perhaps help us understand what happens in 2022 and -- and where are you in terms of the separation of sandoz into a fully autonomous unit inside novartis? i think you said it was probably around the middle of this year that would be complete, and is that the point to which you then decide whether novartis remains the best owner of sandoz? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham. on -- first on kesimpta, back to you marie-france.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so, currently, we have about 2,400 patients treated on kesimpta. and as you pointed out, we have a 12-month bridging program. when we -- when we discussed this at the end of q4, we -- we were actually looking at 30% paid with 70% free.
that -- that is radically changed. so, it looks like we flipped those numbers and we're currently at 70% paid product. we expect that to get up to 80% for the -- the rest of the year and that's why we've changed our percentage sales for the second half of the year from 75% to 65%.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. and then on sandoz's stabilization and dynamics, richard.
richard saynor -- chief executive officer of sandoz
thank you, graham. we've already assumed the level of price erosion going through the rest of the year. you got to remember, a lot of that's been driven because of volume declines we saw in q1. and with volume declines, you saw a stabilization in the market, service levels go up.
and invariably, that means that the competition for price goes up as well. we've seen that will start to wash through and wash out as we go to the second half. we also assume that will be a normalization in demand, patients start returning back to hospital elective surgery. and we also anticipate a slightly stronger cough and cold season, given that it really had very little this season with social distancing.
so there's a number of drivers, and we've already assumed a level of price erosion going on through the rest of the year.  i'll let vas comment on the sandoz in autonomy.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. so -- and thanks, graham. on sandoz, we've now successfully separated the manufacturing unit with links to our global manufacturing.
and i think in most of the relevant area, sandoz is now enabled to compete at the relevant cost structure and flexibility to be successful as a leading generics player. our focus now is to get sandoz, as we've stated consistently, to a consistent mid-single-digit sales growth and core operating margins that are in line with the top end of the peer set, which would be in the high 20s. and that's where our energy and focus is. a lot of that is getting to world-class launches and biosimilars, getting our oral solids business and launches back on track in the u.s., as well as being at market formation for key launches in europe, and that's what we're really focused on at the moment.
thanks, graham. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. the next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions, please. with inclisiran, you attained a pre-approval agreement with the u.k. i'm wondering whether you have or will be entering into similar agreements with european territories for your pd-1 license from beigene? that's the first question.
second question is, could you talk to which subpopulations [inaudible] within the u.s. where you may be able to get on trade with tislelizumab. and then finally, if you have a second to comment on how you look at the competitive outlook for the centers given we've been surprised by ophthalmologists' feedback on brolucizumab ahead of anticipated approval. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, andrew. so both pd-1 questions in europe and u.s., susanne.
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah, sure. thank you, andrew. so, you know, our ambition is to provide global access to tislelizumab is in the broad array of indications. as, you know, beigene is running a very broad development program, you know, and that is really our first ambition.
we really want to establish tislelizumab in key indications, where pd-1s are currently market, and also pursue novel combinations with our portfolio. so really, short term, the focus is on getting first indications filed. we plan to file in non-small cell lung cell cancer and esophageal cancer. and we expect these to be submitted in the second half of 2021.
you know, on specific agreements, i don't want to comment. you have seen the data. we have very solid os data presented at aacr. and we believe that tislelizumab is a very differentiated pd-1.
so in terms of subpopulations, we, of course, want to make sure that we focus on the areas where tislelizumab is differentiated. and i think the two data readouts show that i think there is still space for a strong pd-1. so that's for now, and then we work through reimbursement agreements while we then prepare for launch.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, susanne. and then on lucentis, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so lucentis did really well in q1. it's growing 4% due to the steady performance in europe. so there is some rebound.
we can expect to see that to continue. and also the strong nrdl-driven momentum in china, which is definitely where we're looking to see a good chunk of our growth this year. so for the remainder of the year, we expect to see lucentis grow at low single digits, and again, with china being a major driver. in terms of the competition, just to remind you that lucentis is really established in the market, and we believe we'll continue to do well.
one of -- one of the key drivers is just a very complete indication portfolio that lucentis has and that newer products will not bring to market immediately.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. thank you, andrew. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line -- so your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from goldman sachs.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. two, please. one, vas, i know you kind of suggested that the sandoz separation is kind of the independent company is kind of on group.
but can you just remind us conceptually the positive, the negatives from a novartis perspective of keeping sandoz in-house, kind of it's been a drag on your growth as long as one can remember? so just conceptually, why does it belong within the novartis equity story would be great. and then separately, for marie-france on zolgensma. as we think about kind of the next few quarters, can you just remind us of the incremental countries you're going to be launching the product in and the size of the bolus opportunity in those countries? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah thanks, keyur. so on sandoz, there's, i think, a few considerations. one, historically, and we continue to believe in certain markets, there is commercial synergies in having a broad portfolio across generics and innovative medicines. we, of course, continue to challenge ourselves and evaluate that, but we do have those agreements in certain markets.
and that, yeah, depending on how healthcare systems evolve in the future, it could be an advantage to have one of the largest, if not the largest by volume generics company in the world. the other part of the story, of course, is biosimilars, where our manufacturing scale and know-how enables us, as well as our development expertise, enables us to -- enable sandoz to build a leading biosimilars portfolio and then, of course, the company will benefit over time. and we're hopeful that the, you know, the sandoz biosimilars portfolio can help us get sandoz to that mid-single-digit growth up on the margin spectrum and then contribute to the growth of the overall -- overall company. those, i think, are the two key considerations.
there is, of course, the broader software consideration that sandoz serves hundreds of millions of patients and provides billions of doses to humanity, which is consistent with the overall purpose of the company to reimagine medicine. so on zolgensma, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so in the u.s., our business is driven by the incident patients. so the growth ex-u.s. is coming from these recent reimbursement wins in europe.
for the rest of 2021, we expect the u.s. business to remain stable and to be -- continue to be driven by the incident patients. in europe, we're working on securing reimbursement in additional countries. right now, we've seen good uptake in germany and recent reimbursement and acceleration in smaller markets, such as czech republic or uae.
if we look at the nature of the european markets, we also expect to see reimbursement on a rolling basis. what you can expect going forward is the u.k. and italy, where we've now secured reimbursement, and that will bring zolgensma to additional patients. as we said before, the initial source of business in all of the launches comes from previously treated patients.
and over time, that patient mix shifts to the incident population. overall, for 2021, we expect blockbuster status with zolgensma.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. thanks, keyur. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. maybe a couple of products, specific ones. just on the pipeline phase 2, we're going to see the iga data relatively soon, obviously, perhaps you could give us any commentary around the conference.
and just -- i mean, in terms of the data [inaudible] primary or secondary endpoint with upcr, should we expect to see a consistent benefit on the key secondaries like egfr? and what would you regard as a clinically meaningful improvement on the primary and any key secondaries? and then maybe a question on the shp2 tno155. just your take on any ramifications from some competitor data we saw at aacr. can you just remind us of confidence on that program's potential and when we should be looking to see the first kras combination data? or if you no longer believe that is the most promising combination, what we should be particularly anticipating in terms of the various combinations studies, you know, ongoing that molecule. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, emmanuel. so, john, you want to start on iga nephropathy?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
sure. thanks for the question, emmanuel. as you know, for iptacopan, we're looking across a number of indications, including iga nephropathy, also c3 glomerulopathy, as well as pnh. specifically, in iga nephropathy, we do have the phase 2 dose-range finding study, which is ongoing.
we've had an interim readout and based on that interim readout, we've already decided to advance into the phase 3 studies. those results will be coming out before the half of the year. the specific conference, we -- the posters and abstracts have not been released. so we've refrained from telling you exactly, but we are confident that those results will be presented before the first half of the year.
and as i said, you know, the phase 3 has advanced as we move forward in iga nephropathy and the expected filing is based on conditional approval for proteinuria reduction at nine months. so these are the same results in the phase 2, which we have in the phase 3 study. and as you asked about the secondary endpoint, these are the same secondary endpoints that we have in our phase 3 study. the final approval, which is expected to be in 2025 is based on the egfr slope.
and this was the phase 2 study that we had in place and also is the endpoint also for a full approval expectation in 2025 based on results. so i think the second question that you had was around the shp2 -- our shp2 inhibitor, and how should we be thinking about the shp2 inhibitor as we move forward. as you know, shp2 is as tyrosine phosphatase and exit a really important note as we look at the ras map kinase pathway. and in preclinical studies, what we saw was not only single-agent activity but also in combination with other agents.
our strategy for our shp2 inhibitor is that we expect to go broadly in terms of a number of combinations. and as we look at the approach that we're taking, there's four potential areas that we're currently looking at. first is in combination with our own egfr agent. this would be our third-generation egrf agent -- egfr agent, and this would be our first consideration for combination with our shp2 inhibitor.
secondly is looking at the role of shp2 in immune cells. and so that consideration would be with pd-1, and we have a study ongoing with spartalizumab. thirdly, would be looking at the map kinase ras pathway as we look at the combination with potentially kras c12c. and also, we have a study in place with [inaudible].
and then fourth would be we currently have an early study in combination with dabrafenib, trametinib as we look at the treatment for braf v600-mutant crc patients. so we have high expectations in combination with our shp2 inhibitor looking broadly in addition to the kras c12c pathway. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. and maybe just to highlight again, you know, we're not focused here on single agent. i couldn't see your question, emmanuel. we really think the opportunity for ship2 will be in combination, and hopefully, in combination with a range of agents, and that data should come out over the coming 18 months.
next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matthew weston from credit suisse.
matthew weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
many thanks. two questions, please. the first on u.s. tax reform.
so novartis, like many in the pharma industry, is a major beneficiary of transfer pricing. i'd be very interested in harry's view of the long-term tax rate given the discussions that are being had or proposed by president biden about changing the way multinational tax is calculated with minimum revenue-based metrics on a national approach. and i -- also in the shorter term, if you could just give us some update as to the likely nearer-term impact of anything we've learned from the near-term u.s. domestic biden tax changes, that would be extremely interesting.
and then secondly, a product-specific question regarding the darpin collaboration in covid. can you just give us an update on the project, both in terms of the early clinical data that we've seen on the first stop and how the tech transfer is progressing to sandoz, and your thinking as to when we might have something to file from that program?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matthew. so first on tax reform, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
hi, matthew. so as you know, this year, we guide to about 16% core tax rate. last year, it was 15.4%. you know, we see in the midterm the 16% to 17%, given the current tax loss.
now, of course, the biden proposal, the u.s. part would not be a positive for anybody, if you will, right, from a tax rate standpoint. but our exposure to the u.s., if you will, is relatively low given that the majority of our ip and a lot of substance is in switzerland. and the other issue with all of this is, of course, there not many details are available.
and therefore, i don't want to go into any speculations because we don't know if and what will be in the end implemented. we don't see anything changing for this year or any time soon. at the moment, we have details, of course, we would come up with the respective scenarios.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great, thanks, harry. and then on the molecular partners collaboration, just to remind the group, the idea here was to pursue the darpin technology, which is a naturally occurring -- a naturally occurring protein-based molecule that acts in a completely different way to monoclonal antibody, though with a similar effect. the first darpin -- set of darpins for covid showed very strong preclinical efficacy in preclinical models, also against the variants. at the molecular partners-novartis collaboration.
we've completed the phase 1 study, which will enable a phase 2-3 start shortly. we target a readout in the q3 time frame, which we expect to enable an emergency use authorization, if positive. the benefits of this approach would be: one, the potential for a subcu injection versus iv; and two, because this technology can be produced in bacterial fermentation or used fermentation, i should say, much lower cogs for the medicine, which would enable hopefully, broad-scale use. also, much higher volumes could be produced versus mammalian cell monoclonal antibodies.
so a lot to still work through and figure out, but we're working through it now. and hopefully, this -- with the study start and then the ultimate readout over the course of the summer. thank you, matthew. next question, operator.
operator
next question comes from the line of richard parkes from exane bnp.
richard parkes -- exane bnp -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. firstly, on zolgensma, just in the u.s., i just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about where you are in terms of penetration of the incident sma patient population. it looks like it's just in the 60%, but i wondered what room there was for that to move higher based on screening improvements.
and maybe you could discuss that and where you are in terms of share among the various treatment options in that population that has been impacted by the evrysdi launch. also, i remember you talking about seeing physicians delaying starts due to covid. i'm just wondering whether that's no longer the case. then second question is we've heard from some of the management teams that seem to be expressing some optimism but a compromised solution on u.s.
drug pricing could be achievable given the current balance of power in the senate. and i just wondered what novartis's perspective on that was and your thoughts on what might happen medium term. thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, richard. so i'll just quickly take the zolgensma u.s. question. you know, for zolgensma right now, the principal driver of business is the newborn screening programs around the country, which in those screening programs, very high, nearly all patients tend to get zolgensma.
right now, newborn screening is covering about 70% of newborn lives. we hope to get that number up to 82% before the end of the year. and that would be then the -- the steady-state driver for zolgensma. and then we continue to see some utilization in switch patients who are in the so-called prevalent pool or on an alternative therapy and then switch to zolgensma.
so we do believe we're at a steady state in the u.s. with some potential growth as newborn screening continues to expand over the coming years. and that's kind of how we think about the u.s. zolgensma opportunity.
as we stated in the presentation, we continue to work through the nonhuman primate studies to enable avxs-101 intrathecal to be lifted off of clinical holes, and then we would rapidly want to advance that program through phase 3 studies. we have agreement with fda on the design of that phase 3 clinical trial. now in terms of u.s. drug pricing, we're absolutely supportive of finding a path forward to enable broader and more affordable patient access at the pharmacy counter which would likely include reforms to the benefit design in part d, as well as elements of the design in part b.
i think we saw the outlines of that potential, you know, agreement in the grassley-wyden bill last year. but we are cautiously optimistic that we might be able to come to a thoughtful agreement that preserves the industry's ability to invest in innovation and then also enables broader patient access. but as you know, there are multiple moving parts. the situation is quite fluid.
i think the big shift is that the industry is working to be part of the solution here, working actively with the relevant stakeholders to try to find a sensible set of legislations. thank you, richard.
richard parkes -- exane bnp -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello, thank you. firstly, excluding the impact of forward purchasing, you had both operating income growth and margin expansion this quarter. and i realize this could be difficult to pick apart. but how much were you still benefiting from cost savings that you might not ultimately get to keep in the first quarter? and secondly, for the two ex-china filings you're expecting to make for tislelizumab this year, could you confirm whether or not you expect those to include the u.s.? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so i think quickly on the second point, yes, they would include the u.s. and then on the question on cost savings, i will give it to harry. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah, thank you, laura. so of course, we had still some lower activity in quarter 1. but when you look at the cost levels, they are pretty much in line even the -- with prior-year quarter 1 when the shutdown came mainly only in the second half of march. so -- and then secondly, we are, of course, also driving new ways of working to keep the good things, if you will, of the situation to run the company more effectively, and of course, also our customer-facing colleagues, you know, have a mix of tools which where face to face is most effective and wanted.
of course, that happens. but also the virtue and other interactions. so i would say most of the cops -- cost savings we can keep. on the other hand, some increased investments will happen in quarter 2.
and of course, all of that is part of our full-year guidance.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. thanks, laura. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
ok. thank you for taking my questions. two please if i may. firstly, on zolgensma, going back to the european situation.
could you give us a little bit more color on -- on where the growth was coming from in the quarter. it's -- from what you've said, it sounds like it's still the prevalent population in germany given the timing of the -- the u -- u.k. and italian reimbursed. but any -- any color on that would be useful.
and on to cosentyx, perhaps you could give us your thoughts on the competitive landscape within psoriasis cosentyx in light of the -- the mackenzie map data a few days ago. and secondly, on cosentyx, can you say your thoughts on the cigna debit card initiatives to try and move people off cosentyx and onto alternative products? thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon. so first, on the zolgensma growth, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so when we look at the european business, the -- the -- the incremental uptake has been mainly in germany. and as i mentioned before, we've seen acceleration in some of the smaller markets. so czech republic, uae, and qatar.
we -- we have not yet seen the uptake in the u.k. and italy, and that's what you can expect to see toward the end of the year. so as -- as we said before, we will be moving from incident segments to -- to additional countries where you'll see this initial bolus of patients, and then they'll transition to an incident population as what you see in -- in the u.s. so you can -- you can expect some volatility in -- in the quarterly sales pattern because, of course, it's a one-time treatment.
so every quarter, we start again from -- from -- from scratch. but that's what you can expect to see. we're bringing in new countries. we -- we have a number of countries that have day-one access agreements, and we hope to bring about 15 countries with full reimbursement by the end of 2022.
and then going --
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes, cosentyx. yeah.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so on cosentyx, your two questions. so on -- on the competitive overview, the -- the first thing that i'd say is that we have to remember, in -- in this marketplace, so you -- you -- you referred to psoriasis. the biologic penetration remains really low.
in fact, when we look at psoriasis, we're talking about -- about 15% of biologic penetration. and if we think about cosentyx, we know that there are a lot of competitors out there, but we've shown efficacy across four indications. in psoriasis, our data shows that we clear skin in eight out of 10 patients and that we have strong efficacy across the actual spectrum. remember that two-thirds of patients are going to have some of these manifestations.
one other point i wanted to make is that we have five-year-plus safety data and the bar is very high right now on safety, especially now. so what cosentyx offers is a tried and trusted complete treatment. in addition to that, we have strong access, not only in the u.s. but across the globe.
and so, you know, i keep talking about our three pillars in our strategy and it's exactly that. it's strong access, early line access that's going to allow us to -- to grow volume and revenue in the u.s. and in the eu. we've got the geographic expansion in china with the nrdl that just came in march.
so you'll see more of that in the rest of the year. then we've got our complete profile and we continue to have strong resonance in the marketplace with the data that we have. and of course, in the future, our lifecycle management programs. so we've shown that we can do well despite multiple competitive entries in the psoriasis space and beyond the psoriasis space, and we're confident we can deliver double-digit growth in the year.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, marie-france. 
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
can i take your question on cigna? 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. 
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
so the next question was on cigna. yeah. yeah. so i -- i think that's a question for cigna.
but what i'll say is that we're not going to change our commitment to physicians and patients. we believe that access should enable a clinical decision between a physician and a patient. and that's why broad access is going to stay a core pillar of our strategy. but we'll always balance that with the long-term value of the brand.
we -- we -- we have six potential upcoming indications. so it's our obligation to think about what drives value today but also what drives value in our future. 
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
ok. thanks so much. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much for taking my questions. wimal kapadia from bernstein. to kindly first ask about the psma-617 and the vision -- vision study following the positive headlines in march.
just given the continued changing in the standard of care in prostate cancer, i just wanted to get your thoughts on the trial design and the implications for commercial potential. should the real comparator for vision have been cabin -- cabazitaxel in order to be of real clinical importance rather than the best standard of care given, you know, the likes of zytiga and xtandi are no longer recommended in that setting? so i appreciate it's quite a fluid situation when it makes -- when it comes to trial design. but just your thoughts on commercial impact would be great. and then my second question is just on ligelizumab and the upcoming phase 3 read-out in csu.
just curious on your thoughts on your level of confidence for that read-out later this year. how quickly could we actually see switching from xolair should we see positive data? and can you just provide some context on what proportion of xolair sales come from csu today? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, wimal. and thanks also for your initiation of coverage and your very comprehensive report a few weeks back. so first on -- on psma-617, i'll -- i'll move it to  susanne on the commercial potential in the trial design. 
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah, thanks a lot. so maybe let me start with the trial design. so, you know, just to remind you what the setting was for the vision trial. so it was in -- in progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with at least one line of prior androgen therapy and at least one but not more than two lines of taxane-based chemotherapy.
and resulted that in this setting, standard of care is the best comparator. it's really a setting where there is limited options and this setting of very high unmet medical need. so we believe it is very strong data and i think the fact that we were really showing positive data on both radiographic pfs and os, i think is demonstrating that. and as i said, the commercial potential in this area is still significant as prostate cancer is the second largest cancer indication.
this set in, of course, is in late lines, but we still believe there's very high medical need and -- and lutetium-psma will -- will offer a very, very attractive, you know, treatment option. and then you just look into this setting, think again that the majority of these patients will be metastatic, have a very low survival -- five-year survival rate. so, therefore, it is a significant pool of patients. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
maybe i'll just add, we -- as we noted in -- in the presentation, we've already initiated or will soon initiate a range of earlier-stage prostate cancer studies which will enable us, if successful, to rapidly broaden the indication base for psma-617. so on -- on ligelizumab on the clinical program and our confidence, maybe john and then maybe marie-france on the contribution of csu and the ability to switch from xolair. so, john? 
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
sure. yeah, thanks. thanks for the question. as you know, we moved into the phase 3 program based on the phase 2 head-to-head study that we had against xolair which was published in the new england journal.
based on that phase 2 study, what we saw was 42% symptom-free with ligelizumab versus 26% in omalizumab, which was a significant difference. and scientifically, as we think about that, ligelizumab recognizes a different [inaudible] on the ige molecule for xolair and that's the confidence that we have. and they more specifically binds on the fc epsilon ri effector cells. and based on this fact, we've moved into the two pearl -- two studies, pearl 1 and pearl 2.
but we expect to get those readouts by the end of the year and the early part of next year as we continue recu -- accrue the -- the endpoints. on the population and opportunity, i'll turn it to--
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, we can go to marie-france. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so -- so the first thing to point out is that the biologic penetration in this market space is -- is also really low. we -- we currently estimate that less than 30% of patients are -- are on xolair, and that's probably optimistic. and -- and what we know is that we've got about 1.3 million csu patients in the top 11 countries that are still not adequately controlled.
so this is a big opportunity. this product is showing to differentiate itself significantly and an opportunity for us to bring this product to a much broader population, which right now is really underserved with antihistamines. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thanks, marie-france. so for the remaining questions -- 
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, wimal. if -- if we could limit yourself to one -- one -- one question, that would be great as we have a number of people in the queue. so next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes the line of florent cespedes from societe generale.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thank you so much for taking my question. for susanne on kisqali. susanne, how would you explain the difference on the dynamic of the u.s.
versus europe markets and why europe is much more dynamic than -- than the u.s.? and how do you see the -- the u.s. market breast cancer market dynamic going forward? thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
susanne?
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah. thank you, florent. so, you know, as i said, kisqali globally was growing 19%. and as you rightly point out, there was very strong growth ex-u.s., especially in the eu while we say it's more or less flattish or slightly declining in the u.s.
and i think the reason is really very different market dynamics, that in the u.s., the market certainly is already quite penetrated with cdk 4/6 inhibitors. and when you look at the impact of covid, you saw that nbrx, for example, in february was down 16%. and this has continued now since the pandemic has started. and this is now already impacting trx going down minus 4%.
so, of course, our growth would come from new patients and that's hard to get if -- if less new patients coming in. while in europe, overall penetration of cdk 4/6 is much lower. so the dynamics there are -- are more active, and therefore, we could capture more patients there. so overall, as i said, kisqali with the strong os data, we feel is very well-differentiated.
we keep on focusing, executing our gross brands, and we remain confident also for the u.s. that when patients will come back and -- and things will open up more that we capture again strong growth.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, susanne and florent. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard vosser from j.p. morgan.
richard vosser -- j.p. morgan securities
hi. thanks for taking my question. just a question on the ophtha brands' erosion and just when we should think about that -- that [inaudible] out and the -- and the growth of the ophthalmology franchise going forward? thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, richard. so on ophthalmology dynamics, marie-france? i guess also referring to front of the eye as well. i know xiidra -- strong xiidra performance as well really on the quarter.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
right. i was -- i was going to mention that. so -- so we do -- we -- we do see -- obviously, we've seen a huge impact in -- in -- in this space because of covid. so there -- there is a combination of factors.
so we have seen some loss of exclusivity, which is obviously something that we anticipated over our strike-plan period. and then, of course, there was a covid impact, which really hit the entire offset portfolio, as you know, starting with the anti-vegfs, which nicely recuperated during the year and you see them off to -- to a solid performance across the board in -- in 2021. we still see a -- a suppression in the marketplace, although that's starting to pick up. and what i will point out is our -- our front of the eye portfolio, or namely in xiidra, we -- we do see very encouraging data.
and then we had to relaunch that brand as you know. but we also know it's a big market, right, 32 million people with dry eye disease and -- and only 1.6 million of them are in a prescription drug. so we -- we had a good quarter with xiidra, 28% of nbrx share. and it just shows that if -- if you -- if you have the share of voice, if you have the right campaign, then it's worth investing in this space. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thank you, marie-france and richard. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. the next question comes the line of tim anderson from wolfe research.
unknown speaker -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes, hello. thank you for taking the question. this is richard wagner on -- on behalf of tim at wolfe research. the question on kisqali.
could you speak about what you're seeing in the u.s. in terms of rebating in this oral oncologic category? our understanding is that the rebates are stepping up. presumably, that is driven by pfizer trying to hang on to the market share. what's the outlook for the net price trends in this category and where -- how would those trends in particular impact kisqali, which does not have the volume of ibrance and does not yet have the absolute data? thank you very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard. so, susanne, on kisqali, our cdk 4/6 rebating trends.
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah, sure. so -- so, you know, i wouldn't want to comment on that. i've -- maybe let me just reemphasize what is our strategy. certainly, we see that kisqali has the best os data and also has demonstrated now longest os, combining all the -- the phase 3 trials.
and that keeps us confident that if the focus, continued on execution, we will also see continued momentum. we -- we get very positive feedback from hcps and we see that they are changing now their treatment patterns, that more and more are willing to list kisqali. so i believe our focus needs to be on differentiation, on continued execution of our gross brands. and therefore, i still believe kisqali is a important growth driver for us and i remain very confident in the brand. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, susanne. next question, operator. we have a few more left.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mike nedelcovych from cowen. 
mike nedelcovych -- cowen inc. -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i'm curious on entresto. it looks like the data in the post-ami setting trended toward improvement despite missing the primary endpoint.
but the readout is listed as neutral on the slide. so i'm just wondering, should we take that to mean that filing in that indication might still be on the table? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll just quickly take that. you know, we need to discuss with the -- the regulatory authorities, and we'll present the full data in -- in atc where you can see both the primary and -- and secondary endpoint. so then the question on the table, of course, is we demonstrated a positive trend versus an established standard of care in ramipril.
but it was a superiority study, so i think we'll need to work through with the regulators what's possible in terms of any sort of indication in the label or any data in the label. but we'll -- we'll take those steps, and we'll present the data at atc. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. and the final question comes from the line of peter welford from jefferies.
peter welford -- jefferies & company -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing me in. a quick question on sandoz again. i'm wondering if it's possible of you to quantify the impact of the determination of your solids partnerships, which i guess somewhat of a one-off.
and just thinking about then, the sandoz business and getting it back to growth and margins, how should we think about potential for disposing of parts of that business or slimming the portfolio down? i know you've tried this before. but, clearly, to a certain growth in margins, you know, the other ways to slim down the sales line, is that even viable with the business portfolio that you have? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, peter. good to hear from you, and richard saynor on the sandoz u.s. business and legacy -- well, the --the oral solids and dermatology business.
richard saynor -- chief executive officer of sandoz
yeah. thank you. thank you, peter. so yeah, you're right.
i mean clearly, we've terminated or ended a number of the partnership relationships and that's really washing through from the end of last year really pretty much to the end of this year. so a lot of the decline that you see in the oral solids business is really related to that. but it's our hope that that will wash out by the end of this year. and then really, i see the u.s.
business in sort of three distinct chunks. you have the core business, the injectables, the biologics, and the ophtha business, which really has a strong momentum and potential for growth as -- as we launch new products going into the end of '22 and '23. we're currently looking at how we strengthen and stabilize the oral solid business once that wash-out phase has cleared with both in-house developments and rebuilding that capability, and then looking at also bd and m&a to strengthen it. and then the derma piece, already we've -- we've cleaned up a lot of the derma business.
we -- we divested some of those elements over the last month. and the remaining is relatively stable and accretive to the overall business. so a lot of moving pieces, but we've got a clear plan going forward.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thanks. thanks, richard, and thanks, everyone, for your -- your questions today. maybe just to take a step back.
i think it's -- it's worth -- worth noting, when you look at the longer-term growth profile of the company, our key, again, drivers, cosentyx, entresto, zolgensma, kesimpta are all demonstrating. they have the outlook and the potential to really enable us to grow consistently through 2025 as -- as harry outlined. on top of that, we continue to expect to be able to bring in inclisiran to broad groups of patients in the u.k. and the u.s.
well ahead of the outcome study, giving inclisiran significant potential even ahead of the outcomes data which we now expect in '26. with the kisqali adjuvant and our continued efforts in beovu, you have a broad range of products in hand to drive that growth for the next few years. then on top of that, you have a deep mid-stage pipeline where we continue to show progress, multiple assets that could be multi-billion-dollar potential assets to drive our longer-term growth. you see already the first possibilities with lu-psma and we hope to demonstrate with further readouts over the course of this year the potential of that pipeline.
continued margin progression and -- and aspiration and demonstration of leadership in esg. so i think the -- the story is taking shape and we look forward to continuing to attract long-term investors to our company, to our stock, and our overall vision to reimagine medicine. so thank you all very much for joining the call and we'll look forward to speaking again soon.

2021-Q2,NVS,2021-07-21 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and good afternoon and welcome to the novartis q2 2021 results release conference call and live webcast. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call including the q&a session will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. [operator instructions] with that, i would like to hand over to mr. samir shah, global head of investor relations.
please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head-investor relations
thank you very much and good morning and good afternoon everybody. big thank you to all of you again for participating in this call and spending the time to listen to our quarterly results. the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. these may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.
for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f and its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that, respectively, were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission. so thank you again. and with that, i'll hand across to vas narasimhan.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir. and thanks everyone for joining today's conference call. today with me, i have members of our executive team. and i also would like to introduce karen hale, our new chief legal officer.
karen joins us from the biopharmaceutical industry with over 20 years experience in a broad range of medical devices and pharmaceuticals. so welcome karen. so if we can move to slide 5. i wanted to start by reflecting on the journey we've been on as a company as we focused the company, rolled out our strategy, and delivered consistent performance over the recent period.
going back to the first half of 2018. when you look at our financial performance over the first half of the -- for the subsequent four years, our sales have grown at 6% cagr, our core operating income at a 13% cagr, and we've grown our innovative medicines margin from 31.8% to 36.8% in the first half of 2021, demonstrating that our operational execution has been strong. now, when you look ahead, we remain confident in our growth outlook, as we outlined in the meet the management last year, where we highlighted a 4% cagr off of our 2019 actuals to a 2025 sales goal of $60 billion or more and a consensus im margin that is currently at 37.6% that we remain confident that we can achieve. so a strong performance track record and a strong growth outlook remains the story for novartis.
now, going to slide 6. when you look at our strong performance in q2, it was strong across all of the key elements that we believe will drive long-term value for patients as well as for shareholders. our sales growth was strong, and harry will go through that in a bit more detail. we had strong productivity with good core operating income growth and good margin expansion.
we continued our innovation agenda, which will be critical to driving the growth to 2025, and importantly, beyond. and we also continued on our journey to be a leader in esg with some important milestones. and i'll talk about each of these areas in turn. moving to the next slide.
when you look at our key growth drivers and launches over the period, we demonstrated, i think, strong performance across our key brands. marie-france will talk a bit more about the strong performance of entresto, cosentyx and zolgensma, as well as kesimpta, which is off to a good and strong start. and then susanne will also cover the various oncology growth drivers. now taken together, we -- our key growth drivers and launches now account for 51% of our im sales.
and these products are growing at a rate of 29% in quarter 2, which i think nicely demonstrates our transition from an older portfolio of medicines to a next wave of portfolios, which we believe will enable us to drive our growth over the next decade. now, moving to slide 8. i also wanted to say a word on sandoz. we saw the business stabilize in quarter 2.
we saw sales at 5% in the quarter. biopharma sales were also up 5% and core operating income was also up. now when you look at the story for the rest of the year for sandoz, we continue to expect disruptions related to covid, but we do expect also, assuming healthcare systems continue on their current trend, a return, hopefully, back to a more stable situation. we have had a historically weak cough and cold season and decreased anti-infectives use, but we will see how this all unfolds.
and again, we're hopeful that we can get back to a more stable situation overall in the generics sector. now that said, we are confident in the longer-term outlook in sandoz. we've made the -- we believe, the right investments in biosimilars. we've doubled the size of the biosimilars pipeline with a focus in key therapeutic areas such as oncology and immunology.
and we continue to also invest in our core generics capabilities. we strengthened our antibiotics manufacturing setup as well as brought in a new portfolio of assets, including our recent acquisition of gsk's anti-infectives portfolio. and we continue to make investments in complex generics, including oncology injectables and respiratory medicines. so over time, we remain committed to delivering a sandoz outlook of mid-single-digit sales and mid- to high-20% core operating income margin.
so moving to the next slide and turning to innovation. q2 continued progress on the innovation front. we had approvals of cosentyx in the u.s. in pediatric psoriasis, as well as entresto in essential hypertension in china, which can be another growth driver for entresto, building on its already strong performance.
i'll say a bit more on some of these other milestones in subsequent slides. but i did want to note that asciminib, our abl001, has been filed in the u.s. in the third-line setting. and we do believe this medicine has blockbuster potential in the third-line setting alone, not to mention our efforts to move it into earlier lines, which we'll say more about.
and we also had important advances on kymriah and apelisib as well, which i think will enable us to broaden the indications for both of these medicines. so moving to slide 10 and taking a little bit of a deeper dive on our portfolio, starting with our life cycle management. i already mentioned the china approval in essential hypertension. but in -- for cosentyx, we remain on track for the hidradenitis suppurativa readouts in the second half.
there is strong open-label data that supports the use of cosentyx in this indication. and then we also have a range of other indications we're developing, as we've noted, to enable cosentyx to continue its strong trajectory. we're on track for kisqali's monaleesa-2 os readout in the second half, which would be the third os readout. two have already been favorable for kisqali.
really building on the unique profile we believe kisqali has. we also are on track for the adjuvant readout in 2022. we'll speak more about leqvio in a moment. now, turning to pharmaceuticals.
we'll go through iptacopan's data in a bit more detail. but i wanted to highlight as well that ligelizumab's csu studies are on track for phase 3 readout in the second half. we have also initiated on our progressing chronic inducible urticaria studies as well as food allergy studies. and we have continued to progress branaplam with an agreement now with the regulators for a start in the second half of a phase 2b study in huntington's disease.
moving to oncology. our canakinumab readouts are also on track. for lu-psma, we have submissions planned for the second half, and we've started the phase 3 studies in the earlier line settings. i'll say a bit more about that.
and i also wanted to highlight that, with tno155, our shp2 inhibitor, we've already now advanced both in combination with other kras agents, but are also now moving into the clinic with our shp2 in combination with our own kras agent, jdq, as well as other shp2 combinations that we're currently exploring. lastly, i wanted to note that asciminib now has entered our wildcard box on the bottom here in first-line setting, where asciminib is going against investigator choice of tki. our hope is, if we were able to deliver this result, we would be able to once again transform the care of cml patients with a multi-blockbuster potential indication for asciminib. it's worth noting that across the wildcards you see in that box, while these programs are still early, each one of them has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar medicine if we're ultimately able to deliver on the clinical value of these assets.
now moving to slide 11, saying a bit more on inclisiran. you likely saw that our pdufa action date is now january 1, 2022. we have filed the -- refiled from our schaftenau site, which is the manufacturing location where we currently do secondary manufacturing for products such as cosentyx as well as other biologics. so a site that's well known to the regulators.
we also have -- believe we've addressed the concerns that fda has raised. and it's notable that fda has not raised any concerns related to the efficacy or safety of inclisiran in any of the interactions that we've had. so this is a class 2 resubmission, a six month time line. we of course will continue to work with fda to see if there's opportunities to move this up earlier in the time period.
but hopefully, now this will get us to a place where we can bring this very important medicine with a very substantial potential for the company to market in the united states. now moving to the next slide, turning to lu-psma. you likely saw in the asco plenary session, the medicine has really remarkable results of 38% reduced risk of death and a 60% improvement in rpfs. regulatory submissions are on track for the second half.
the movement into earlier line studies with the psmafore and the psmaddition studies are already underway. and we're also evaluating whether to move the medicine even into earlier line settings. we're working very hard to also expand the relevant capabilities to administer the medicine, and susanne will speak more about that in a moment. moving to the next slide.
iptacopan continues to show its utility across a broad range of indications, as you saw in the quarter. with iga nephropathy, we presented the primary endpoint at era-edta, a 23% reduction in proteinuria at three months. and it's important to note that this was a three month time point. we expect that proteinuria, over time, to continue to improve as we typically see in studies like this.
so we look forward to looking at the six months and beyond endpoint. also importantly, there was a stabilization of renal function, which will be very important from a regulatory as well as clinical utility standpoint. the applause igan -- iga nephropathy study is now ongoing to support the filings worldwide in this indication. we also continue to progress our c3g indication for this medicine with eu prime designation already achieved.
we had a 49% reduction in proteinuria with this medicine at three months. again, we would expect that trend to hopefully continue in subsequent months. a stabilization of renal function, also well tolerated. and this phase 3 study now is enrolling to support filings worldwide.
and moving to the next slide. when you look at iptacopan in pnh, we also presented data here in the frontline setting to complement the data we already have as an add-on therapy. this new data, which we presented at eha, showed clinically important benefits of monotherapy of iptacopan. and this novel agent, with its ability to inhibit factor b with a -- both impact intravascular and extravascular hemolysis gives us hope that we can be ultimately indicated for frontline usage as well as add-on to eculizumab.
worth noting, it's unique as an oral agent with a great safety profile. so we look forward to completing the apply-pnh studies with the superiority endpoints, and then again, to support filings worldwide. as you likely saw as well in our recent investor day, on this medicine, we have a broad range of indications also now advancing. we believe this medicine has a substantial potential to treat a range of immunological, renal and hematological diseases.
now moving to the next slide. one piece of data that came out in the quarter that didn't attract as much attention as what one might have expected is our zolgensma sprint data. this was remarkable data showing the impact that gene therapy can have on children with sma. in this study, 100% of the patients met the primary endpoint of sitting independently when treated in the presymptomatic setting.
so these are patients who are identified through newborn screening and treated with zolgensma. 100% of patients met the secondary endpoint. also with respect to walking and standing, we saw remarkable gains for these patients, which we hope will continue to improve over time. this data reinforces that zolgensma is a foundational therapy for presymptomatic and symptomatic children with sma.
it also continues to give us confidence that, over time, as gene therapies as a sector matures, our capabilities in gene therapy, having learned so much with the introduction of zolgensma around the world, building outstanding manufacturing and technical capabilities, will allow us in the long term to be a leader in gene therapies for the decade to come. now moving to the next slide. i also wanted to say, and as a last note on the pipeline, an update on the sabatolimab stimulus program, which is progressing in mds and aml. now as a reminder, in phase 1  studies, we showed that sabatolimab had 50% or -- 58% orr in myelodysplastic syndromes.
and given this unique mechanism of action, it's the first io agent in the hematological setting. it gave us confidence to move forward in mds and aml with the stimulus programs, which are pivotal studies that tackle both of these indications. now the parallel execution of these trials offers us a range of filing options. we did have the cr readout, and the dmc recommended that we continue the study blinded to the pfs readout.
and then of course the os readout as well will come over time. it's also worth noting in the mds program, we have a third study in the stimulus array of studies that also looks at the -- with a triplet combination, including venetoclax. so we believe we have a program that can adequately cover the range of potential options that would be needed for patients to be treated effectively with medicines such as mbg. so we remain very excited about the program.
we think scientifically, mechanistically, and as a first-in-class asset, it can be an important addition to aml and mds treatment, an area that we've been a leader in for many years. so we'll look forward to keeping you updated on this program. now moving to esg. we had strong progress on esg.
i think some notable milestones in our effort to be a leader in this space. we reached 1 billion courses of antimalarial treatment delivered since 1999. it's 1 billion patients we've been able to treat with our coartem, a pioneering agent to treat malaria. very proud of that achievement.
we also recently announced a 10-year commitment to empower 1,200 african-american students, working with historically black colleges and universities to really address the inequities in medical education, and broadly, inequities in healthcare in the united states. and you can see other important milestones that we hit over the course of the quarter. so we'll look forward to continuing our progress on this front and being a leader in esg for the long term, ultimately embedding this into our business to drive long-term performance. so with that, i'll hand it over to marie-france.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
thank you, vas. good morning, good afternoon to all. and pleased to update you on our q2 pharma performance. if we move to slide 19.
we delivered 12% growth versus prior year and an additional $1 billion in revenues. as you can also see, we also continue to make progress on our portfolio shift. our growth drivers and launches are showing excellent momentum with 35% growth, and these now contribute to more than 50% of our top line thanks to our strong focus on execution. you can expect this shift to continue as we invest behind our growth drivers and launches and also actively manage the mature portfolio.
if we move to slide 20. consentyx delivered 21% growth. u.s. volume growth in q2 is now back in line with the market and sales were up 11% quarter over quarter.
our field force activity is above pre-covid levels. and as we see the market regaining momentum, we also intend to capture more volume. ex u.s., we had really strong growth in europe. and in china, we quadrupled sales versus q1 following the nrdl listing in march.
so full year, we're on track to deliver double-digit growth based on our broad access, our ongoing geographic expansion and the continued investment. we can now proudly say that 500,000 patients have been treated with cosentyx. and with our ambition to expand to 10 indications, we know that many more can benefit. we'll continue to invest with additional approvals in the short term and with our hidradenitis suppurativa readout toward the end of the year.
if we move to the next slide. entresto saw another very strong quarter with 46% growth. in the u.s., you can see from the nbrx growth that we're really capitalizing on the acc consensus recommendation and also on the expanded label. in europe, the esc guidelines now recommend entresto as first line, and that is further reinforcing our position as first choice.
china, we tripled sales compared to previous year on the back of strategic account expansion. in fact, china is now entresto's second-biggest market. so this team is strongly focused on execution, educating prescribers on guidelines, activating patients and ensuring the guidelines become protocol at hospital level. you can expect to see the usual summer slowdown.
however, full year, we will stay strong as we address the remaining 70% of patients who do not yet benefit from entresto. if i move to slide 22. zolgensma is continuing its growth trajectory as we open up reimbursement in new markets. as you heard vas say earlier, we've got compelling data in presymptomatic patients, and thus, it's really important for us to continue the work to implement newborn screening.
as we know, the earlier we treat, the more transformational the outcomes are for these babies. in the u.s., 80% of newborns are being screened, and this is allowing treatment within a few weeks of birth. ex-u.s., we expect to see italy and the u.k. and additional reimbursed markets to drive the growth in the second half.
and even though you can continue to expect some volatility in the quarterly pattern, we're on track to exceed blockbuster status this year. our preclinical studies for it are progressing well, and we're actually ready to start our phase 3 as soon as the fda gives us the green light. over time, the it formulation can more than double the number of patients who could benefit from zolgensma. if we move to the next slide.
with kesimpta, our focus is on broad adoption in early lines of therapy. we've added 500 new prescribers and we've doubled the number of patients on kesimpta versus q1. we also see that half of the kesimpta usage is a naive or first switch. and this is exactly where we want to be.
the b-cell class is currently leading the recovery of the dynamic market, and kesimpta has got the second-highest nbrx share in the ms space. so this positions us well as the market opens up further. as we move to the second half of the year, we know what we need to do to double demand, and we're doing what is needed for a strong q4. we're maintaining our leading share of voice to really increase the awareness of kesimpta.
we also believe that our pira and our igg data provide important clinical differentiation. so we're fully focused on what we need to do. we're also fully focused on delivering a positive customer experience. in fact, 80% of patients are receiving their first dose within five days, and our patient support services are enabling fast and easy initiation.
if i move on to slide 24 and move on to leqvio. we all know that ascvd is the leading cause of death, and unfortunately, mortality is on the rise. there are effective treatments. we know that too.
but patients are not at goal due to access, adherence and affordability challenges. and this is why we're taking a different approach on how we bring leqvio to market. in the u.s., we've got a new action date for january, and we're preparing for launch. our access strategy could actually enable two-thirds of patients at launch to access leqvio with a $0 copay.
so we're working with healthcare systems on broad adoption. we're using our existing infrastructure to identify patients and also to set up buy-and-bill administration. in the u.k., we're partnering with the nhs to bring leqvio to more than 300,000 patients at risk of a second cv event over the next three years, and we're on track for that launch in q3. we understand this approach will take time, and further evidence generation.
but this level of ambition is absolutely necessary if we want to drive better outcomes for ascvd patients. so in summary. an excellent quarter. we're fully focused on our strategy to maximize our growth drivers, deliver our launches and also prepare for the next wave of innovative medicines.
as we further accelerate our portfolio shift, we're also transforming our business. we want to be much more customer-centric and also pursue innovative approaches to launch our products in partnership with healthcare systems around the world. so coming out of q2, we had good momentum across the globe, which we expect will continue in the second half. i want to take a moment to recognize the fantastic teams around the work for their hard work and for delivering these results.
over to you, susanne.
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
thank you, marie-france. and moving to slide 26, i'm very pleased to give an update on the oncology business. so the oncology business showed very solid performance in the second quarter, delivering 7% of growth with sales reaching $3.9 billion. our growth drivers and recent launches are showing good momentum with 19% growth versus prior year, driven by kisqali, jakavi, promacta/revolade and kymriah.
and together, these products now contribute to half of the overall oncologies, allowing us to more than offset losses from continued generic erosion of glivec, afinitor and exjade/jadenu in the u.s. in q2, the oncology market continued to be affected by covid-19. oncologists are reporting that there's case load, depending on geography, is still 25% to 50% below pre-covid level. and most affected areas are our breast cancer portfolio, recent launches, and hospital-initiated therapies like kymriah and lutathera.
looking at kymriah, this grew globally 19%, and it was driven by strong ex-u.s. growth and geographic expansion. in the u.s., we remain very competitive. however, overall demand in the class has slowed down.
and lutathera sales were growing 10% in q2. the ex-u.s. growth was double digit. and we also saw positive sickness in the u.s.
as it is emerging from covid and referrals started to increase. so overall, we remain confident that patient visits to hospitals will increase and treatment patterns will further improve in the second half of the year, leading to acceleration of growth in these segments. moving to slide 27. i wanted to share a bit on our performance in the u.s.
u.s. remains our biggest market globally and is contributing to over 40% of our overall oncology sales. our growth brands and launches contribute to 49% of sales. the u.s.
market is slowly recovering from the pandemic with oncologists' case load now reaching 75% of pre-covid level. however, testing rates for the most common tumor types remain suppressed in q1, delaying diagnosis and new prescriptions. in q2, we have seen partial recovery of our growth drivers and recent launches, together growing 10% versus previous year and also accelerating versus previous quarter. so this was mainly driven by promacta, kisqali and taf/mek.
overall, with continued recovery of the market, we expect acceleration of sales in the u.s. in the second half of the year. moving to kisqali on slide 28. kisqali delivered strong performance second quarter, growing 36% with sales of $225 million.
the uptake was mainly driven by continued momentum in patient share gains ex-u.s. and particularly in europe. kisqali is the market leader in premenopausal setting in france, italy and spain. and in the u.s., we have also seen kisqali sales getting traction, delivering 17% versus previous quarter, driven by increased demand and new patient starts.
we see increased field force reach in those accounts where access restrictions were lifted, and we also continue to leverage digital engagement based on dynamic targeting. at asco, we presented updated os data from our monaleesa-3 trial that showed consistent os benefit with a median os of four to five years. and with this data, kisqali demonstrated the longest os in postmenopausal patients and is the only cdk4/6 inhibitor with data in first line with fulvestrant. we believe that these excellent results may be attributed to the unique profile of kisqali versus other cdk4/6 inhibitors, with preferential inhibition to cdk4 over cdk6 and a high concentration to inhibit the target.
in addition, we are going into the adjuvant setting with our natalee study, exploring kisqali in both intermediate and high-risk population. and just to remind you, this population represents around 70% of the adjuvant early breast cancer population, and there's a clear unmet medical need. i am very pleased to report that the enrollment of the natalee study is completed and we are on track for readout in 2022. moving to slide 29.
as you heard from vas, we are very excited about data from the vision trial that positions lutetium-psma well to potentially address the unmet needs of more than 80% of men with late-stage advanced prostate cancer who express psma receptors. and just to remind you that prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer globally. and in the majority of cases, patients unfortunately, developed metastases by the time of castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis. earlier in june, we got breakthrough therapy granted by the fda, and filing to fda is on track for the second half of '21.
we are fully in launch preparation with focus on the top 200 treatment centers, and are also working on raising awareness on the clinical relevance of psma. very pleased to see growth in the psma. awareness has doubled among the target physicians over the last month. and just to reassure you that we have adequate capacity to meet the demand for the current launch.
so our focus will be on driving referrals from community centers, where 70% of prostate cancer patients are treated. when you model the lutetium-psma launch, keep in mind that hospitals need to set up processes and licenses and patients need to be selected through psma pet scannings. and these factors are likely to drive a more gradual uptake at launch versus what you saw with the bolus effect on lutathera. moving to the next slide, slide 30.
i would like to talk about a launch preparation for asciminib, the first stamp inhibitor that has the potential to transform cml treatment standards again. in the phase 3 ascembl study, asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response at 24 weeks compared to bosutinib. we have completed filings for fda and ema earlier in june, and the fda has granted two breakthrough therapy designations and fast track designations for asciminib and is reviewing the file under real-time oncology review. as we are preparing for the launch, our focus is on raising awareness on importance of stamp inhibition to overcome resistance and minimizing off-target events typical for tkis.
aided awareness has already reached 75%. and just to remind you, the third line indication for asciminib has already blockbuster potential. but we are also very excited by the potential benefit that asciminib may provide to cml patients in first-line setting. despite the advancements in treatment of cml over the last 20 years, there are still around 50% of patients who relapse or are intolerant to imatinib in first line.
and more than 30% of patients suffer from tki-related nonhematological ais. we believe that, in earlier lines of cml treatment, asciminib may prevent resistance currently available tkis. and therefore, we are initiating a phase 3 study of asciminib versus investigator-selected tkis, with enrollment planned to start in the second half of '21. so moving to slide 31.
we have made great progress on our innovation agenda, and '21 is a very important year in terms of readouts and submission. in addition to the vision data, we had multiple readouts like positive data from to iptacopan in pnh, alpelisib in pros, kymriah follicular lymphoma and os data for lutathera. canakinumab readout in second line non-small lung cancer did unfortunately not show positive data, but it is very important to mention that we have two more studies ongoing in first line and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer, with the first line trial on track to read out in second half of '21. later in the year, we're also expecting kymriah to read out in second line non-hodgkin's lymphoma and kisqali os data from monaleesa-2.
in terms of submission, we have completed submissions for gvhd for jakavi in europe and japan, tabrecta at in europe and asciminib in third line u.s. and europe. and for h2, we are on track for filing of lutetium psma, kymriah in follicular lymphoma, and second line on non-hodgkin's lymphoma and tislelizumab in non-small cell lung cancer and second line esophageal cancer. so exciting times ahead for oncology.
big thank you to all the teams. and with that, i hand over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, susanne. good morning and good afternoon, everybody. so i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the second quarter and the first half of the year.
and as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless otherwise noted. so on slide 33. you see the summary of our operational performance for the second quarter and the first half. we had a strong quarter 2, resulting in a solid first half performance despite the impact of covid during the period.
quarter 2 net sales grew 9% to $13 billion driven by our key growth drivers. and core operating income grew 13% to $4.3 billion, mainly driven by the higher sales and favorable gross margin, partly offset by higher investments. core eps growth was also up 16% to $1.66. and free cash flow grew 17% to usd 4.2 billion.
of course, we appreciate the benefit on comparison from the low base in quarter 2 2020 due to the covid destocking in the prior year. however, even when excluded, we still return to healthy growth with sales up 5% and core operating income growing 4% quarter 2 2021 underlying. our half 1 performance was solid with 3% growth on the top line and 2% on the bottom line. core eps grew 5% to $3.17, and free cash flow was $6 billion.
of course, for half 1, the quarter 2, quarter 1 destocking, stocking from the prior year has washed out. so these values represent underlying growth of half 1 2021. next slide, please. so on slide 34, i want to dive into our performance during the quarter by division.
innovative medicines delivered a strong quarter with plus 10% top line and plus 14% bottom-line growth and a margin of 37%. even if we adjust for last year's lower base, we still saw strong growth with innovative medicine sales increasing 7% and core operating income up 6%. the innovative medicines performance was driven by continued strong double-digit growth of our key growth drivers, including cosentyx, entresto, zolgensma and the oncology launch brands. and as vas mentioned earlier in the presentation, our growth drivers and launches are driving portfolio rejuvenation and now account for over half of our innovative medicines sales.
of course, the pandemic still impacts our business, particularly sandoz retail and the anti-infective segment. however, the sandoz business is now beginning to stabilize with sales up plus 5% in quarter 2 and bottom line growing 3%, although growth did also benefit from prior-year destocking. now, turning to our full-year guidance on slide 35. we confirm full-year guidance for both the group sales and core operating income.
for sales, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit growth in 2021. and for the bottom line, we expect mid-single-digit growth ahead of sales. for innovative medicines and sandoz, we are also not making any changes. we continue to expect innovative medicines division sales to grow mid-single digit and core operating income to grow mid- to high single-digit ahead of sales.
and for sandoz, we continue to expect sales to decline in the low to mid-single-digit range and core operating income to decline low to mid-teens. the key assumption for the guidance is that we see a continuation of the return to normal global healthcare systems and prescribing dynamics in the second half of this year. and in addition, we continue to assume that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics would enter in 2021 in the u.s. on next slide, we provide some detail on our expectations for the second half of the year.
we expect top-line growth to accelerate from 3% in half 1 to mid-single digit, bringing us to the low to mid-single-digit range for the full year. our assumption is that this will be driven by growth acceleration as we continue to return to normal prescribing behaviors as well as further sandoz stabilization. we expect core operating income growth to be high single digit in half 2, reaching our mid-single-digit expectation for the full year. core operating income growth will be driven by higher sales and ongoing productivity programs partly offset by increased investments in our growth drivers and pipeline.
it is possible that we could reach the higher end of the ranges we have provided. but as you know, the covid situation still remains fluid. finally, on slide 37. as currencies are constantly changing, i want to bring to your attention the estimated currency impact on our results using the current exchange rates.
so if mid-july rates prevail for the remainder of 2021, the full-year impact of currencies on sales would be positive 2% and on core operating income, positive 2 to 3 percent points. for quarter 3, it will be positive 1 percent point on sales and positive 1 to 2 points on core operating income. and as a reminder, we always update this estimated currency impact on our website on a monthly basis. and with that, i hand back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. so moving to the next slide. when you look at 2021, we have a broad range of catalysts still to go. we've also had good pipeline delivery over the course of the year.
so we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to advance these assets and programs. i'd also note, our mid-stage pipeline continues to generate, i think, exciting new innovations, which we hope will emerge and be able to add to our pipeline over the course of the second half. now moving to the last slide, just to close. as i noted at the beginning, our consistent long-term performance over the recent years is driving our confidence for the future and the continued growth outlook for the company.
we've had strong performance in q2, driven by the key growth drivers, as you've seen throughout the presentation. and we've also continued to advance our pipeline of novel medicines. you've seen the positive readouts across iptacopan, lu-psma and others. and we're reconfirming our full-year 2021 guidance, our commitment to drive long-term accretive growth.
and again, thank you for your commitment to the company. and so with that, i'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
operator, if i could just say one thing. if questioners could limit themselves to two questions, we'd appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you. your first question today comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein. please go ahead. your line is open.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much for taking my question. i'm wimal kapadia from bernstein. first, i'm just curious how novartis are thinking about the potential impact of the sglt2s for entresto following some of the recent positive data in the preserved ejection fraction population.
clearly, these drugs have quite a robust profile and have -- are reasonably well priced, and have demonstrated efficacy on top and in entresto-naive patients. so do you expect to see any impact? i'm just curious on your level of confidence that these drugs will not be used ahead of enteresto. my second question is just on iptacopan. clearly, lots of interesting data recently for the drug across multiple indications.
but i'm just curious how novartis is thinking about it from a commercial perspective. i appreciate this will come down to time lines and which indications demonstrate efficacy in phase 3, but they're quite a different size of markets and competitive dynamics are quite different. so ultimately, how novartis is going to prioritize, should we see success across multiple indications? particularly given the acceptable price points by indications could be quite different and competition from the likes of the apellis could limit the potential. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, wimal. so first on the sglt2, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
so thanks for the question. as you rightly said, the sglt2s are add-ons. and so we expect them to continue to be used predominantly in diabetes patients. even if we think about the new readout of pef, we've really only seen the press release and we'd have to look at the full data because the trials were really quite different.
the bottom line is actually entresto has a unique position, and it's got a broad label in the u.s. that's covering five out of six patients with chronic heart failure. we're very strong with the cardiologists. and we're going to focus on making sure that 70% of the hfref patients who are on previous standard of care switch to entresto.so i think between the compelling data, the strong guideline support that we have, the commercial infrastructure, the excellent team that we have in place, we have what it takes to continue the momentum with entresto.
and if patients need an add-on, then an sglt2 is the right thing to do.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then -- thanks, marie-france. and with respect to iptacopan, i think our overall strategy, as you can see, is to fully leverage the unique mechanism and profile of this medicine across the range of indications we've outlined. now of course it will be data-driven and the sequencing will be determined by the data. but our goal is, on the one hand, to disrupt existing markets with the fact that we have a safe oral that can be given broadly to patients who, at the moment, are taking at least -- at the moment taking ivs on an ongoing basis.
and so we think there's a very attractive profile there. and then to enter into completely new market segments in renal disease, hematological illnesses that currently don't have a very strong standard of care. and so that's how you're going to see us approach the launch, fully maximize the asset across the full range of numerous indications we're pursuing. thanks wimal.
next question.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. thank you. your next question comes from the line of graham parry, bank of america. please go ahead.
your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so first one is on kesimpta. just wondering what percentage of drug dispensers free drug in first half and how you expect that to be in second half.
because you said you expect demand to double, 2h. and i think if you take first half sales and add on twice that, you get to around consensus of $350 million. but if you're getting less free drug, could you actually beat the consensus number? and then secondly, on the natalee trial, now that recruitment is complete, can you narrow the window down to when in 2022 we might see the data? even just is that -- do you think it's a first half or a second half event? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham. on kesimpta, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so on kesimpta, our key focus is really on broad adoption in early lines of therapy. and i say that because i think it's really important for our strategy that everyone understand that we want to ensure the value of high-efficacy b-cell therapy early. as i said in my opening comments, we have about 500 new prescribers, and we've also got about twice as many patients on kesimpta's q1.
all patients are starting on free drug. and even though our free-to-paid conversion is happening really quickly, there's always a bit of a lag. so in the second half of the year, we know we have the fundamentals in place. we know we still have some scaling to do around familiarity of the brand given that kesimpta is new in market.
and we're going to focus -- we're going to continue our focus on leading share of voice on the differentiation and really on consistently enabling fast and easy initiation. so for the full year, we're comfortable with external expectations. we know what we need to do to double demand in q2 and really deliver a strong q4. medium term, we expect kesimpta to be a major growth driver for the company.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. and then on natalee timing, john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
yeah, thanks for the question, graham. on natalee, which is our adjuvant study for kisqali, as we disclosed earlier last year, that we've increased the recruitment from 4,000 to 5,000 patients. and this includes both the intermediate and high-risk patients who have had advanced breast cancer. our final result that we expect to read out is going to be at the end of next year, and that's how it's currently powered.
as we said previously, we're not disclosing interims. so we're currently powered for the end of the year next year for our final readout.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. so thanks for the question, graham. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. thank you. your next question comes from jo walton from credit suisse. please go ahead.
your line is open.
jo walton -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. my first question is about marketing spend. so we saw in the second quarter of last year clearly, very little on the sales side and a dramatic constriction of everybody's marketing spend. and then could you give us some idea of how you've opened that up, what sort of level of your marketing capacity you're at now in the second quarter as you enter the third quarter? and how you think marketing spend might be able to be sustained at perhaps a lower level going forwards, i don't know, more use of digital or whatever.
but if we can get a sense of whether you feel -- or how confident you are in a reduction in your long-term marketing spend because of all the things that you've learned with covid. and my second question would be to ask for a bit more detail on china. you've talked about drugs where you've tripled sales, quadrupled sales. can you just give us a little bit of an idea of your level of investment and your level of ambition in china, please?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, jo. so first on marketing spend trends, i'll hand it to harry. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, jo. so on the marketing spend, it's actually playing out as we guided to early in the year, which is, as you pointed out, quarter 2 spend is quite higher than last year quarter 2, where basically, all major markets were locked down. maybe other than china, but also in the u.s.
so that's why we guided also that, in the first half, we wouldn't see margin improvement. and i think with the sales of 3% and core operating income of 2%, we saw that also playing out. so i would expect continued, especially quarter 3, where also last year's spend levels were low, that marketing and sales growth is at a certain healthy level given the investment needs. but of course, within our guidance, be it on our productivity programs, on manufacturing and overall, the expected sales growth that, then in the second half, also as we had more normal, i would say, spend levels in quarter 4 last year, that this plays out.
and i laid out that in half 2, we will have some very nice margin improvement that leads to the full-year guidance of margin improvement. now in the midterm, i do expect that sg&a will be, together with manufacturing productivity on cost of goods, be the major driver of our margin increases, especially innovate medicines, to the high 30s. and certainly, a change in mix somewhat a bit more to virtual, digital. but still face to face in most markets being important, especially for launch initiation.
but i would expect that sg&a is one of the major drivers to continue to improve in the midterm our margin.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and on china, jo, first to take a step back. a few years ago, we began an investment effort in china, really putting in the necessary infrastructure both in pharma and oncology, building out sales forces to really enable us to drive longer-term growth. and then second, we adopted a development strategy to bring our full portfolio of medicines to china, as well as including china in our phase 3 programs at the start.
so that given the changes in the regulatory framework there, that would enable us an earlier launch. now fast forward today, we are growing in the high-teens percentages in china overall. from a business -- we're on track on our stated goal to double the size of our china business from the 2020 baseline. we expect to be, if current trends prevail, one of the top three players among multinationals, if not more, in china by 2024, 2025.
that's driven primarily by new medicines. so overcoming any of the medicines that ultimately get tendered, driving -- our newer portfolio driving the growth. we have 50 potential approvals in that time frame, continued strong success on the nrdl listings, as you saw with consentyx. so we expect china to become the second-largest market for novartis in the world.
we see profitable, accretive growth being driven from there, and we'll continue to look to invest prudently in china over the years to come. thanks jo for the question. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. i have a couple of questions, please. first on kisqali and the natalee trial. given the outcome of the penelope-b trial with ibrance, how comfortable are you that your disease-free survival data that you'll have at the end of next year has significant -- have sufficient duration on it to satisfy the fda without wanting to see further follow-up? and then second question on business development.
we've seen a rash of your competitors doing neurodevelop -- neurodegenerative deals. you've obviously had the surprising approval of aducanumab. how is that influencing your interest in the neurodegenerative space? and then if you could also comment on your chairman's recent comments of novartis' interest in mrna as a platform. many thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, andrew. on the kisqali situation, john, do you want to take that?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
sure. thanks for the question, andrew. and as we've taken a look, as i said earlier, we've increased the number of patients in our natalee trial from 4,000 to 5,000, including both intermediate and high-risk patients. as we look at this patient population, there's a couple of things that we focus on.
one is we have a longer treatment duration, looking at a duration of three years for the overall treatment. so that should give us confidence in the approach. we've also looked at the adherence of patients, particularly in the first year. as we look at these patients, as you know, in the early treatment of these patients, micrometastatic disease is important.
and what we've seen, at least across both arms, is that the patients are adhering and staying on drug at the 400-milligram dose. so with those two specific components, we feel comfortable with the readout at the end of next year.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. and so on business development, we of course are watching the changes in the approach to the use of the accelerated approval pathway. as we've already noted, in neurodegenerative diseases, we have the ongoing program in huntington's disease entering phase 2b, and we'll certainly consider how best to potentially bring that forward if there's a way to accelerate regulatory submission, assuming positive clinical trials. and then also internally, we've had neurodegeneration efforts within the country for many decades, as you know.
and we continue to have programs targeting alzheimer's disease, huntington's, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases, both using biologics, rna interference, sirnas and asos as well as gene therapies. so that will continue. no specific comments on bd&l in the neurodegenerative space. of course, we are looking, as always, for attractive assets to bring in given our broad-based efforts in neuroscience.
on mrna. again, not much more to add. i think we've watched how mrna continues to have value in the covid space and are curious to see, could mrna have applicability more broadly within the vaccine space? we have our own ongoing efforts internally, obviously, with inclisiran in manufacturing, for sirnas with pelacarsen, with antisense oligonucleotides, we're a substantial manufacturer of those technologies. and also have internal efforts on rna interference.
so that work will continue. and we'll continue to evaluate if there is any sensible approaches in mrna more broadly, but nothing imminent at the moment.
so thanks andrew for the questions. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much. firstly, on kesimpta. i wondered if you could give us the nbrx share in the u.s.
currently. and then in terms of thinking about those 13 launches anticipated by the end of 2021, how we should think about the advantages and disadvantages of a subcut formulation for a b-cell therapy in those launch markets outside the u.s. and then secondly on inclisiran, two parts. first part, what are your latest thoughts around fda site inspection? and how should we think about the future supply split between yourselves and a third party? and then you sort of mentioned these new initiatives, v-initiate and v-inception, which are kicking off now ahead of outcomes data in 2026.
could you elaborate a little bit more on those initiatives and others you are looking to increase the evidence base behind inclisiran before we wait for those outcomes data? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark. so first on kesimpta subcutaneous outside the u.s., marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so kesimpta is an important launch for us outside of the u.s. and if i just -- if i look at europe alone, we've got 420,000 patients living with ms and many of these patients are on low-efficacy therapies. actually, many more patients are in low-efficacy therapies versus the u.s.
so what we also know, we're currently working through reimbursement and to accelerate access. but what we also know is that a lot of these patients don't have access to infusion centers. so our research tells us that physicians and patients will appreciate a self-administered, high-efficacy therapy that can be used in the comfort of a patient's home. so right now, we're working with each country through their own reimbursement system, and we know what we need to do to bring kesimpta as quickly as possible to patients around the globe.
on your nbrx question, currently, our nbrx share in the u.s. is 11%.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and i would also note on kesimpta, if you look at one case study in the u.k., our ability to get rapid access there, i think, demonstrates the value in ex-u.s. markets of the subcutaneous formulation, where the overall cost effectiveness of a therapy is high on the system's mind. on inclisiran, just on the manufacturing side of things. in the u.s., our intention at the moment is to focus production out of our schaftenau -- novartis-owned schaftenau facility.
we can't predict on whether or not the fda will inspect. it's notable that this site is regularly inspected, has been recently -- this very line has been recently inspected by fda using a remote inspection and approved for use in a given indication. and so we'll have to see what the fda ultimately determines. but i think it's notable that this is a line that's regularly used and inspected by the fda.
and then in terms of the data initiatives, maybe marie-france, on the efforts to build out data on inclisiran?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yes. so i mean, you saw some of that on the slide. and obviously, learning from entresto, we know that we need to build evidence generation. you know about our efforts on the outcomes data, so orion-4.
we're also looking at primary prevention studies. but we're also looking to complement with the v-initiate trial. for example, on the different ways of accessing inclisiran when it comes to acute coronary syndrome or use or no use of ezetimibe. so that's the level of evidence and generation that we want to build around the product so that we can ensure fast uptake.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. and i just want to add that we continue to work with various important parties. so we hope to have updates over the second half of the year on our partnership with the nhs on inclisiran. that's something we've highlighted in the past.
that will be a very important proof point that inclisiran can be used at a large scale in healthcare systems. we're also partnering with major organizations in the united states, such as the american heart association, and we hope to announce others, which i think will also demonstrate that we can generate evidence but also generate large-scale utilization volume demand for the medicine. so we'll keep you updated as those happen. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. please go ahead. your line is open.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. emmanuel from deutsche bank. maybe a question on sabatolimab, the mds1 deferral -- effective deferral for pfs readout. i think the original fairly long-term guidance has been for a filing on the cr readout in the second half of this year.
so what can we interpret on efficacy from that data monitoring decision or recommendation to continue until the pfs readout. unless i'm mistaken, that's a couple of years away. so does that impact your guidance around that being potential blockbuster $1 billion-plus indication? and then a question on zolgensma. you've given helpful guidance of around 20% newborn screening rates in europe.
does that inflect next year or is it going to be a relatively slow incremental build? how are you progressing in terms of national level discussions about -- particularly in light of, as you said, presymptomatic data? and then if i may, just a quick one on the intrathecal. it sounds like not much has changed since q1. i think you said then you had agreement on the trial design, you were waiting for the clinical hold to be lifted. so is it -- are those discussions ongoing or has there anything new actually happened in the last few months? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, emmanuel. so first on the sabatolimab cr readout, john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
yeah. for the sabatolimab, as you know, this is our tin-3 compound, our first-in-class io therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome and aml. as we designed the study, we always had two primary endpoints. the first primary endpoint being complete remission and the second endpoint being progression-free survival.
and as we read out the complete remission, we reached the number of endpoints in the earlier part of this year. at that point, the dmc data monitoring committee came back and told us to continue the study as originally planned. so you've seen the slide that was shared earlier by vas in terms of the number of readouts. as you've seen, we actually look at not only mds but also aml.
so as we look at this, we do think that this is a differentiated asset for -- not only for us to think about high-risk mds, but also aml based on the fact that it has a good safety profile and potentially pending results, the efficacy in terms of durability of response. so we await the results in 2022 and '23.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and i think, emmanuel, as we highlighted, there's multiple different filing options depending on how the results play out. and it doesn't change our belief that the medicine given it's a first-in-class asset that has a different mechanism than any existing therapy or late-stage therapy that can be a significant $1 billion-plus medicine. on zolgensma, on the incremental nbs and how we're doing on newborn screening, marie-france, do you want to say a word about that?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. i would just say that -- so you know that in the u.s., the newborn screening is high. outside the u.s., i mean, it really is a market by market. so it's gradual.
i mean, i can give you some information. germany will be implemented by -- from october. we'll see parts of belgium screening. from the beginning of this year, we know that poland is implementing gradually.
we've got other countries across europe that are doing this. so it's a mixed picture. we're very committed to it. we know that it's really important to start zolgensma early.
we saw that from the sprint data and how amazing the results are when babies are treated early. so it is a priority for us. and then of course, medium term, our goal is to bring zolgensma to older children once we get the it formulation.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. and just another word on that -- thanks, marie-france. on the intrathecal, there's no update, emmanuel, we continue to work through resolving the fda's concerns. but we do have the protocol.
finalize agreement with the fda on the phase 3, design or preparing operationally for the study's execution with the belief that, that indication can continue to be a multibillion-dollar indication for the company. and as soon as we have any updates on the preclinical topic and resolution with the fda, we'll of course provide it. thank you. next slide -- next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of richard parkes from exane bnp. please go ahead. your line is open.
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
hi. thanks very much for taking my question. just two questions. firstly, on sales and margins, both your expectations for 2q that you set out at the 1q results.
i just wondered if you could discuss what surprised you positively and confident that those trends will continue, given that you haven't updated guidance? and i just wondered if you could add your thoughts on impact of the delta variant and maybe whether you've adjusted your planning or solutions for healthcare systems, opening up on the basis of that? and then secondly, just a question on some of your legacy oncology assets in the u.s., specifically promacta, tasigna and tafinlar. if i look at sales per script over the last few quarters, at least in the first half, it looks like sales per script has been growing in double digits, which seems to imply quite significant price increases. i just wondered whether you could discuss that trend and whether there are any other factors such as channel mix that might be impacting that? thank you,.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard. so first on sales and margins outlook, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. the hard -- the line was a bit hard to understand. richard, could you briefly repeat?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
harry, i think the question was, was there anything that surprised us versus the q -- the guidance we gave after q1 on how q2 would play out? and how do we potentially see the delta variant impacting our guidance for the rest of the year?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so yeah, ok. thank you. so richard, obviously, we delivered a bit more than what we thought, right? so we saw in the u.s.
a bit faster reopening, i would say, in most of our brands. sandoz is pretty much in line with expectation, but our innovative medicines, some better momentum overall. and then also very good work from our manufacturing colleagues on productivity, in addition to always perfect levels. but overall, i would say, slightly ahead of our internal expectations in quarter 2.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. i think on the delta variant, we continue to monitor the situation. what we are expecting is that given that healthcare systems have seen the impact when they have shut down to patients with non-communicable diseases and the substantial impact that has, we remain optimistic that healthcare systems will ensure that patients get the care they need while dealing with any surges that may or may not happen with respect to covid-19.
now on promacta, taf/mek, u.s. performance, susanne?
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah, thanks a lot. and richard, on promacta, actually, we are very, very pleased with the performance. as you rightly note, 18% growth, and it's really across all geographies and it is volume driven. and it's really still our main indications, itp and saa.
to give you a little bit more granularity on the u.s., we had 11% growth. and maybe just to remind you, there was a label update earlier this year that makes promacta even more competitive. we are seeing share gains increasing, nbrx. and of course, it is the efficacy driving that.
it's also the oral convenience and is the nonimmunosuppressive benefit over competitors and therefore, a very strong performance. ex-u.s., we saw 26% growth versus previous year. it's very strong underlying performance in major markets like the eu. and also just to mention very strong performance in china, where we got the rl listing end of last year.
so very pleased with promacta. similar on tabrecta, we could -- sorry, on mekinist/tafinlar, we could really stabilize market share and are very competitive versus new entries. very pleased with the growth, also across geographies. and also to mention for china, we are very pleased we got taf/mek included into the nrdl list.
so really strong growth on volume base across geographies.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, susanne. thanks, richard. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim. please go ahead. your line is open.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. so just two quick ones. as we think about the opportunity in mds and for the tin-3 asset, i was just hoping if you could give us a little bit more color on the evolution.
i just wanted to follow up on the previous question. and specifically, as it relates to the cr response there, is that -- your conclusion there that the proceeding to the pfs benefit is a clear positive moving into the subsequent events or is this just a continuation of the trial, which could be viewed as somewhat disappointing on that side of it for the high-risk mds patient population? the second question, obviously, you guys are talking quite strongly about the opportunity for asciminib, just in the third-line setting, blockbuster potential. can you just talk about that relative. is that predominantly relative to bosutinib as sort of the primary opportunity and kind of replacing that asset or replacing that product sales or is it really speaking to a broader opportunity in the third-line setting because of potential for duration of use expanding upon how that product is used so far? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, seamus. so just in the interest of time, on the mds, i think with the cr readout, i would say neutral to positive. i mean, neutral is saying because we're blinded, so we don't know what the dmc saw. but i think the fact that the study will continue now to the next set of endpoints and the positive mechanism that we see in the previous data that we've seen on the product.
we remain optimistic that both in mds and aml, we can get to positive results and bring meaningful innovation patients. as john noted, the studies have a range of different designs, including a third study that also takes into account venetoclax, a doublet and triplet design. so i think we have the bases covered, and we look forward to getting the additional readouts over the coming year and a half. on the sales potential of asciminib, susanne, do you want to say a word about this?
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah, i'm happy to take that, vas. and maybe just on the opportunity on sabatolimab, just why we are very excited is because it's a completely novel mechanism. it's a tim-3. so has the potential to be the first immuno-oncology therapy in hematology, in mds and aml.
and why we believe that is important is because obviously, there is -- now has been made progress on having more efficacious treatments but what we all know, durability and also safety profile is still remaining challenging. and therefore, we are very excited that sabatolimab would have this attribute to add really huge value to this medical need. and on asciminib to maybe lead you a little bit through just to remind you a little bit on the dynamics in cml. so there is still 10% to 15% of patients that progress to third line.
but what you also have to know, there is a significant number of patients that remain in second line just because of lack of options for these patients. moving to third line. what we still see is a 75% failure rate which of course is devastating. and that's why there is still a big percentage of patients sitting in second line even if treatment is not optimal.
so therefore, you see that is the pool we are targeting. and we also, with asciminib, expect longer duration of the current treatment. so that is where potential comes from. and i think we still underestimate the earlier lines potential.
of course, we have changed completely the outcome of cml. but as i said, in first line usually patients are started on imatinib, and there's 50% of patients that relapsed. what you also have to know that 30% of first-line patients having issues with adverse events and really are struggling for such a long-term treatment. and that's where with the profile of asciminib, we expect to also add value there and that's why we're also entering into first line.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, susanne. thanks, seamus. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg. please go ahead. your line is open.
kerry holford -- berenberg -- analyst
thank you. a couple for me, please. harry, just on the second half outlook. you obviously raised the pharmaa form operating profit growth guide in the slide today, but you're not updating the gross guidance for the group.
and although you've not changed the outlook for sandoz, in the second half, what is it within this division that problems continued caution for that second half outlook just by those improvements you've seen in q2? and then on inclisiran. just i think a question was asked on this earlier, but just to clarify. what are your plans on the manufacturing of that drug in the future? can you remind us where the ex-u.s. supply is manufactured? should we understand that the global manufacturing sites is now the austrian site or should we anticipate further significant investment at some point perhaps in the u.s.? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, kerry. so first on the sandoz outlook on the second half, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, kerry. so we have to remember how quarter 1 and quarter 2 have developed here. so clearly, you saw a very steep decline of quarter 1.
and then you saw that 5% growth of sandoz in the second quarter. but underlying, if you take the prior year is talking about minus 1%. so we saw as expected a stabilization but we have a first half with a 5% decline. so in order to be at the low to mid-single-digit decline in the full year, we continue to expect stabilization around broadly in line for the second half for sandoz.
and i think that is, at this moment, a very reasonable assumption. of course, we can all make scenarios around cough and cold and flu season in quarter 4 and the market dynamics for that. we have taken the midpoint scenario on this. so overall, i would say of course volatility given the covid situation and how the cough and cold season would be.
but overall, i would say our guidance is quite, starting from a minus 5% decline in half 1, quite reasonable that sandoz would stabilize. they have a few first five launches in the second half. so that helps. we have to see also how the pricing in the u.s.
continues to develop. so i would say not all were overly cautious but realistic.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and then kerry, on manufacturing, it's important to note when you take a step back. our overall goal is to have novartis be the primary manufacturing of both the upstream and downstream parts of this sirna for inclisiran. and we've made the necessary investments to do that.
we have substantial manufacturing capacity to synthesize the sirna. and then as we've noted, we -- in the u.s., we'll move to using our facility. and over time, globally, the primary manufacturing will be done out of novartis facilities, being supplemented by cmos as needed. the primary reason to do this is, one, we believe the medicine will be, as we've noted, one of our most significant medicines.
and then second, from a cogs standpoint, our goal is to drive significantly down the cost of goods to enable large-scale use of the medicine in the secondary prevention study and eventually perhaps in the primary prevention study. right now, ex-u.s., we do use third parties for both the primary and the secondary. but again, over time, the evolution will be the novartis owned facilities. and those investments have already been either started or completed.
thanks, kerry. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from peter welford from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. just 2, please. firstly, on oncology.
just looking at some of the hospital-administered drugs, in particular, and also some of those that require either biomarker diagnostic -- companion diagnostics to use, it actually looks as though the second quarter for some of those drugs is sort of relatively weak compared to the first quarter. there certainly wasn't sort of an uptick. i'm thinking the likes of kymriah and lutathera, for instance. also as well, i think things like even to break and other drugs.
i wonder if you could just comment on what you're seeing there with regards to why i guess we're not seeing q-on-q improvements in oncology and how we should think about that perhaps in the second half of the year and the gating factors? and then secondly, i just want to come back to harry's comments that we could reach the higher end of the outlook ranges that covid situation remains fluid. should we take that to mean that if covid situation pans out as we currently see, the higher end of the range is where we should be thinking or should we take that as thinking that you just don't know, and you still see uncertainty? i guess curious sort of where you're thinking with regards to the current covid situation and whether the situation has to deteriorate significantly for that to be not valid? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, peter. so just briefly susanne, on the hospital administered oncology.
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
yeah. thank you, vas and thank you, peter for the question. so as i mentioned in my presentation, these areas that you mentioned hospital-initiated areas but also of course where you have new launches, this is still impacted by covid, especially when you look at the u.s. that only 75% of patients are back versus pre-covid levels.
so we still like a fourth or a quarter of patients volume that we usually saw. and that is impacting, for example, diagnostics, it's impacting screening. and that's of course tabrecta would be such a brand where you see lower biopsies, you see lower testing reit rates overall. i have to say when you look within the ones that are tested, tabrecta and testing for cmet is increasing, but it's just suppressed patient volumes.
and this is same, what we see for hospital-initiated product. just to give you some figures on kymriah, as i said, 19% versus previous year. but we saw that especially in the u.s. the whole class saw a reduced demand.
and while we stay very competitive with kymriah,and that is really linked to recent also manufacturing success rate that customers are very pleased about, it's really the demand that we saw in the whole class going down. and on lutathera, there is some early positive signs in the u.s. we have seen growth versus previous year as some now referrals are started, but it's still very, very suppressed. and we remain confident that with now the market opening up centers, taking more patients in, this should improve and accelerate.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, susanne. and then peter, on the outlook, as harry noted, it's multiple dynamics of course we're monitoring. but if the business dynamics continue as we currently see them, if oncology can continue its recovery, if sandoz remains in a stable situation, given the strong growth we're seeing in our growth drivers, there's certainly the potential for us to be at the higher end of the guidance.
and we'll of course keep you updated in quarter 3. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello, thanks. first question is on leqvio, please. have you dosed any patients in the u.k. under your program there yet? i think you said the program was starting this quarter.
and what setting will those early doses be given? and are these patients being seen in the hospital or have you managed to get it into primary care from the word go? and then second question is just on entresto. could you maybe talk a little bit about the uptake in the past population?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, laura. so first on leqvio, the agreement, we're still working through the final stages with the nhs. so we have not yet dosed patients in the u.k.
the agreement, though has the aspiration that this would be rolled out in primary care from day 1 at scale, trying to address the ascvd population and get the u.k. toward its long-term goal in cardiovascular health. so we -- hopefully, we'll have updates in the coming months on that pioneering initiative, which we hope will catalyze leqvio's global impact over the coming years. on entresto, half of that -- and i'll just start taking the questions given the time entresto half of that.
we do see, i think, the uptake already, and you can see that in the nbrx, but it's still early days. and i think as we continue the rollout in the education as well as the awareness on the guidelines, we would expect to see continued growth for entresto. we see a strong outlook for the brand. we're confident we'll be in that $4 billion to $5 billion range.
and as we continue to see the trajectory, we'll provide further updates on the long-term outlook for entresto in the coming months. thanks, laura. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from tim anderson from wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. on consentyx, thinking about bimekizumab, they've gotten some good exposure recently with publication of their data in the new england journal. beats your product on efficacy, has a one side effect of oral candidiasis. how much do you think this product will impact consentyx? and do you think that one side effect is a material impairment to their product in your view? and then on tislelizumab, your partnered pd-1, how realistically will we compete in a setting like lung in western markets? can you and your partner assure us you won't be disruptive on price? i ask because u.s.
markdowns for price erosion over time in the category, i'm wondering if it's going to be driving?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first on cosentyx. when you look at the dynamics, we've been able to take on competition consistently over the recent years, continue to grow the brand double digit, as marie-france said, to 20% plus. that's driven both in dermatology and in rheumatology.
we know the additional competitors coming in. i can't comment specifically on bimekizumab, but we do think that consentyx' very clean safety profile, the fact that it's used in such a broad range of dermatology offices and consistently across patient types, its ability to address scalp, palmoplantar psoriasis as well as the joint manifestations and the fact that we have additional indications, we're not concerned by additional il-17 entrants. and really our focus now given that we've been able to effectively hold price in the u.s. market despite some disruptive attempts.
we are confident now that our focus has to be on the next wave of indications to drive this brand well beyond the $5 billion benchmark we've already put out there. on tislelizumab, you've seen the esophageal cancer filing. we're moving toward first and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. we do believe that the -- we are able to market this medicine from a competitive standpoint, given our long presence, particularly outside the u.s., but also in the u.s.
we'll be prudent in how we think about the pricing, but we do think we can make a compelling value proposition. longer term, real opportunity for us is in combination. we'll be taking forward tislelizumab in combination with our shp2 inhibitor in combination with some of our rlt agents, among other opportunities. and so we're going to work to both maximize on the combination side as well as take as much as we can of a very large pd-1 market given the broad range of indications we expect the agent to have.
thanks, tim. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. two, please, if i may. just going back to leqvio. i wonder if you could give us some idea of the ramp to 300,000 patients given the unusual situation you have there, having not only agreed reimbursement but also utilization? and then secondly, moving on to sandoz.
harry, you gave the principal drivers for expansion of the im margin over time. i wonder if you could do the same for the sandoz margin? thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, simon. so for leqvio in the u.k., it's going to be driven by our ability to work with the u.k. to get primary care physicians to diagnose these patients out of the ms data systems and then rapidly get them on to leqvio.
i think it will be a slow initial ramp, and then we hope to see a rapid ramp-up. in the u.s., we've done a very good job of targeting the relevant integrated health systems to hopefully be prepared to have a reasonable uptake initially. but again, it will take time to get those centers on board. in parallel, we'll also have a traditional launch with our traditional sales and marketing approach, leveraging the entresto field force and reach.
so on approval in the u.s., we'll go very -- obviously, out very strongly. it will take time to get the brand up. and then once we think we get momentum, we expect the brand as we've guided to, to be a very significant multibillion-dollar medicine for the company. midterm sandoz margins will be driven by a portfolio shift with the biosimilars portfolio, large number of biosimilars in the mid-20s.
we expect to get forward, get into the market and some of the first-in-class first hopefully, to markets such as natalizumab, among others. and then on top of that, the ability to launch additional injectables and oral solids, while continuing to drive down cost of goods. so you'll have a mix shift to higher-margin products as well as the continued efficiency gains and cost of goods. and then lastly, richard and team are working hard to optimize the manufacturing and sales set of leveraging digital technologies.
and i think that will be the other element that will help us get to those mid- to high 20s margins in sandoz. thanks simon. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from steve scala from cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen & co. -- analyst
thank you. i have 2 questions. first, on avxs-101. can any findings from the preclinical intrathecal safety studies be shared with us today? so that's the first question.
and then on the second question relates to the kisqali adjuvant interim look in natalee. i'm curious if this look has already occurred? if it has, then it would seem to be a material update and you would have announced it. so i assume that it has not yet occurred, but please confirm. thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, steve. on avxs-101 it, the preclinical data we've seen to date do not indicate any concerns. however, we need to complete the relevant assessments.
and of course, ultimately agree with fda and the listing of clinical hold. and so we'll keep you updated as that progresses. the natalee interim has not occurred. but as we've guided to, we're no longer guiding to interim analysis timings and we're focusing on the final outcomes.
john, as you mentioned earlier in the call, we expect that to be in the back half of next year. and of course, as we learn more in that study, we'll keep you updated. thanks, steve. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of naresh chouhan from intron health. please go ahead. your line is open.
naresh chouhan -- intron health -- analyst
hi, there. thanks for taking my question. just 2, please. in the u.k., we recently seen increased structure hospitals partly due to covid and partly because of the record patient.
we've seen electives and oncology appointments being delayed as a result. are you seeing early signs or anything similar in the u.s. as you go into a few states where hospitalizations are rising pretty quickly? i'm just wondering whether or not that have you seen early signs of that in the u.s. and secondly, on asciminib.
do you expect's food interaction to be flat on the label given to the earlier studies? and how do you expect that to be up especially with the generic price probably in the market launch. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, naresh. on the u.s., we currently don't see any shifts in utilization or better notable, other than what we already stated in the call, oncology is below pre-covid levels. cardiovascular is also below pre-covid levels.
so entresto continues to have very strong performance and patients with heart failure seem to be getting the medicine as expected. so nothing that we can flag at this point and also the clinical trials are enrolling on time. so we have learned a lot about managing -- i think the healthcare systems have learned a lot about managing covid. we've learned a lot of them managing our trials and the uptake of our medicines during covid.
so hopefully, we can navigate this next period successfully, but certainly something we're watching very, very closely. i think it's too soon to comment on specifics on asciminib's label. i would note that the safety profile was remarkably clean. when you look at the -- it was a head-to-head study versus bosutinib across all relevant safety markers.
it was a very clean profile patient stayed on drug. so we're optimistic that overall, the asciminib profile will be attractive, which is a part of the reason as well as susanne mentioned, we're quite confident that if it ultimately proves superior can be a very effective first-line therapy. next question, operator. thanks, naresh.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from martial descoutures from oddo bhf. please go ahead. your line is open.
martial descoutures -- oddo bhf -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. i would like to come back on the sandoz business, and thank you for your previous answer on the h2. we understand the next step with the top-line improvement driven by the pipeline with biosimilars and the section of complete generics.
but could you share with us your vision on the improvement of the ratability in midterm? do you see any concrete operation or leverage on the cost or due to the improvement of the top line expected and the affiliated cost plus the price erosion. should we consider stabilization of this activity for the next year, if you could give us more color maybe to help us to manage the core ebit margin in the next quarters and years? thank you very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes, martial, i fully picked up the question, but i'll give my best answer. so when you look at sandoz evolution over time from a margin standpoint. first, right now, our goal is to invest and create a very strong pipeline performance, in this period of time, both biosimilars and oral solids. so in the coming years, you're not going to see big shifts in the margin or the operating leverage.
but our belief is, given richard is driving very strong efficiency gains across all the relevant p&l items, and we continue to expect important pipeline delivery in biosimilars in respiratory and oral solids. when that pipeline delivery happens, then we expect the margin in the midterm to be accretive and move up into that mid- to high 20s. so the shape is going to be stable for the period, next few years, and then we expect acceleration in margin improvement for sandoz as that portfolio ultimately comes through. so i think that's the best way to think about it.
and i think that was the -- we have one more question, operator. so operator, could we go to the last question? thank you.
operator
thank you. your last question today comes from keyur parekh from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you and thank you for taking my questions. vas, if i may, your introductory comments on sandoz, talking about the strategic vision in the long term, almost like setting the narrative for a 2022 decision on the longer-term outlook for sandoz. am i overinterpreting your comments or is that the time frame in which we should expect a broad decision on whether sandoz is a part of novartis and not longer term? that's question number one. and then question number two, we are getting very close to on an annualized basis, kind of the peak sales numbers you provided for cosentyx and kind of entresto.
so i'm wondering kind of why we haven't seen updated kind of peak sales estimates for those two products. is there anything from a competitive or market perspective that worries you or was this just not the right opportunity for to -- for you to address the longer-term peak opportunity for those products? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, keyur. good to hear from you. on sandoz, there's no updates or changes. i mean, our goal right now is to put sandoz in a strong position to invest in the business so that it can be on a track to be the leading generics company in the world, which we think it can be from a financial as well as impact standpoint.
if and when we take any decisions or start a process, we'll of course let you know. but right now, our focus is on the operational performance of sandoz and supporting richard and his team to driving that mid-single-digit growth and margin expansion that we've outlined. i think on your second question, i think we are very pleased with the trajectory of entresto and cosentyx. you are correct if we're approaching the sales outlook of $4 billion to $5 billion we guided to in entresto, and $5 billion plus in cosentyx.
our current plan is that meet the management will provide an updated outlook on both of those brands, especially as we understand better the dynamics. but certainly, would want to highlight we are confident in both of those brands to be very strong pillars of novartis in the years to come. so thanks, everyone, for joining today's conference call. apologies we ran a bit over.
we'll keep you updated. thank you for the interest in the company. and please stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to speaking soon. thank you.

2021-Q3,NVS,2021-10-26 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q3 2021 results release conference call and live webcast. please note that during the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call, including the q&a session, will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. [operator instructions] with that, i would like to hand over to mr.
samir shah, global head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much, and hello, everybody. i'd like to thank you for taking the time to participate in the q3 novartis conference call. the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. these may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.
for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f, its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that respectively were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission. and with that, i'll hand the call to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir, and thank you for everyone for joining today's conference call. with me in the room, if i could have the slide up with our colleagues, on slide 3, with me in the room, i have harry, marie-france, susanne, john, richard, karen, and, of course, samir, who you've just heard from. so, turning to slide 4 and then slide 5. we wanted to start by taking a step back and really reflecting on how this quarter continues, i think, what has been a very strong trend for the company over the past four years.
looking at nine months, for each of the years back to 2018, you see we've consistently demonstrated the ability to grow our sales at 6%, annual cagr 13% on core operating income, and a consistent expansion of our innovative medicines margins. now looking ahead, we stand behind our belief that we can continue to grow our sales over the coming period at a cagr of 4%, driven by, first and foremost, our key growth drivers, which we'll talk more about over the course of this call; our strong mid-stage pipeline; and the continued investment we have on technology platforms, which we think over time will differentiate us and enable us to have a steady flow of innovations to drive growth. moving to slide 6. for q3, we had strong performance across each of our four main value drivers.
we'll talk about sales growth throughout the call, and harry and our colleagues, marie-france and susanne, will give you more details. we had good productivity with our core operating margin now reaching 37.8% in im. on the innovation front, i'll go through some of the milestones in more detail later on. but i think it was a busy quarter for us with some negatives, but more positive overall on balance.
and we continue our journey on the innovation -- on our innovation efforts. and then lastly, in esg, we had our recent esg day where we laid out our longer-term esg strategy. and we continue to have the ambition to not only lead in the biopharmaceutical industry, but also across large companies. now moving to slide 7.
our key growth drivers and launches had a good momentum in quarter 3. we're very pleased with the performance. we'll go through some of the brands over the course of the call. but notably, we now have 53% of our sales in the quarter coming from these key growth brands, and that's up 26% versus prior year.
and i think that demonstrates that we're a company that has replacement power, that can continue to generate innovations that overcome expiries and drive that consistent growth over time. moving to slide 8. we had particularly strong growth on some of our key brands, including cosentyx, growing 18%, entresto was up 41%, zolgensma up 49%, kisqali 27%, and cosentyx continues on its solid and accelerating launch trajectory. marie-france will go through that in a bit more detail.
moving to slide 9. we announced this morning, we are raising our peak sales guidance for both cosentyx and entresto. so first, from cosentyx, and we'll go through this in more detail a bit later. we've raised our peak sales guidance to $7 billion.
this is driven by market growth, geographic expansion, as well as life-cycle management opportunities. and we expect this brand to continue to be a strong element of novartis' story through this entire decade. now moving to entresto. we believe on slide -- back on slide 9, we believe we'll continue to have strong growth driven by market penetration, guidelines, and geographic expansion.
our peak sales guidance is consistent with our currently stated assumption of an loe in 2025. however, we do have issued patents going out to 2027 and an additional group of patents that were recently issued out to 2033. and we'll continue to aggressively defend our ip to maximize the impact of this medicine. now moving to the next slide.
i also wanted to say a word on china, where we continue our strong growth trajectory, one of the leading multinationals in the market in china. we continue with a double-digit growth in the high teens, 16% and 18% on the quarter. this is driven by a few factors. one, the continued positive momentum we have on our growth drivers that have nrdl inclusion.
and we believe we're outperforming other multinational companies for the sales growth of these nrdl-listed brands. we also have limited exposure to value -- to the volume-based pricing. when you look at our commercial footprint, we've been expanding our commercial footprint to reach lower-tier cities and hospitals. and lastly, our late-stage pipeline continues to mature in china.
we had some important recent approvals, entresto hypertension and lucentis and additional indications. and we have 50 additional submissions planned in the next five years. so, we're confident we're on track to double our china sales from the 2020 base by 2024. moving to the next slide.
now turning to sandoz. in sandoz, we had a mixed quarter. we see in the ex-u.s. dynamics normalizing, but a little more challenging environment in the u.s.
so first, in europe, we had a 2% sales growth. and this was really driven by both biosimilars, as well as retail and a return to gaining market share in our key markets. in the rest of world region, we were up 6% with steady growth across regions. however, in the u.s., we did see a 20% decline.
and this was driven by price erosion, as well as contract terminations in our oral solids business. we also had an impact on core operating income. this is primarily driven by the unfavorable gross margins from the product mix in the u.s. now turning to q4.
we do expect performance to normalize in the ex-u.s., and we'll continue to work to stabilize the u.s. we expect our direct demand business segments to normalize, but at different rates. we continue to expect demand to be in line with what we saw in q3. and we're hopeful that we'll see a cough and cold season that returns to pre-covid levels.
we did have a minor impact as well from a negative impact from losartan in q3, and we continue to expect to see some of those negative impacts in q4. now moving to the next slide. we did announce this morning that we're commencing a strategic review of sandoz, consistent with what we outlined a few years ago. we had stated that we wanted to create a more autonomous sandoz within novartis that would give us the optionality to ultimately determine whether is sandoz best owned by novartis or by our shareholders or another party.
and we believe the gx market is attractive. we think sandoz is well placed to capitalize on its growth drivers over the next decade. and we think sandoz is also well placed to really be a leader in the next wave of biosimilars launches. when you take each of those, in turn, attractive market, $400 billion of sales going to loe over the coming decade, a cagr of 4%, sandoz was a no.
1 position in europe and in biosimilars, as well as a leading position in areas like antibiotics and a clear strategic focus that richard and his team have put in place. we have a very strong biosimilars pipeline with 15 assets in development, aiming for $3 billion of sales by 2025 and $5 billion by 2030, a clear strategy in complex, small molecules and ongoing margin improvements primarily through improved cogs through our technical operations unit. so, we expect to conduct this review over the coming period, and we would plan to provide an update on progress latest by the end of next year. it is notable that sandoz is more integrated into novartis than alcon was historically.
and so, there are important considerations we'll need to work through from an it and business services standpoint to really enable us to make the best decision. now moving to slide 13. from a pipeline standpoint, we had a busy quarter, some approvals, a number of readouts -- many readouts that went our way, but also important readouts that didn't go our way. and we acknowledge those and are working to learn from them to continue to improve our pipeline performance.
but on balance, we would say we continue to be at the industry. benchmarks are better in terms of pipeline success rates by phase. from a submissions standpoint, a number of submissions went in. and i think importantly, we received two designations, priority reviews for both asciminib and lu-psma-617.
both of those reviews are ongoing and should enable a launch in the relatively near term. and moving to slide 14. going a bit deeper, and we've reframed these next two slides rather than looking at pharma and onco to really break it out by business franchise and global franchise of the various businesses. so, starting in pharmaceuticals and cardiorenal where, of course, we build on the strong position we have with entresto.
leqvio, we remain on track for an action date on january 1. we have good discussions with fda, are continuing to progress the assessment of our austrian facility. no issues have been flagged. so, we remain on track for that approval.
at iptacopan, we continue to have solid progress on this medicine with phase 3 started in iga, c3g, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. we also disclosed in our quarter that both the final readouts for both c3g and iga nephropathy, which followed these patients for a bit longer, continued the trend of improving renal function. pelacarsen continues to perform well in its phase 3. from an immunology standpoint, we announced today that cosentyx had a positive phase 2 readout versus steroids standard of care for giant cell arteritis, and we've moved now to begin a phase 3 program.
and of course, the hidradenitis readouts are continuing, as well as the -- on track, as well as the other phase 3 programs. ligelizumab remains on track for its readout, and we'll talk about remibrutinib. i did want to highlight we see very good data, mid-stage data for ianalumab, which is our anti-baff receptor antibody. and we'll be presenting more data in the coming quarters on this medicine, but we're excited about its potential in a range of autoimmune, as well as hematological indications.
turning to neuroscience. the sma intrathecal avxs-101 intrathecal fda hold has been lifted as we previously disclosed, and the phase 3 now is initiating its -- a global phase 3 program covering two- to 18-year-olds. branaplam, our splicing inhibitor for -- splicing modulator, i should say, for huntington's disease, has its phase 2b now starting with all the relevant regulatory clearances achieved. and we will announce -- and we've announced, and i will talk a bit more about remibrutinib in a moment.
turning to the next slide from an oncology standpoint. here, we had, of course, a number of events. we'll talk about kisqali and canakinumab. lu-psma, we've already mentioned.
i did want to flag. we've started now both our earlier-stage studies in the pre-taxane, as well as the hormone-sensitive metastatic settings and are continuing to evaluate to move -- potentially move this medicine into earlier lines. we did announce as well that jdq443, which is our in-house kras inhibitor, has had a good pk, good dose finding. we think it's a very good profile for this medicine and are now moving it into phase 2 studies in non-small cell lung cancer, but then we'll also look potentially at other indications.
and this enables us to have in our own hands, our own combination of a kras inhibitor and a shp2 inhibitor. our tno shp2 inhibitor is now in a number of early stage studies looking at combinations. and we'll hopefully be able to present more data on this in the early part of next year. turning to hematology.
our first-line study for asciminib now has also started. our pnh for iptacopan is progressing well. our sabatolimab programs remain on track. and importantly, now with ytb, our next-generation cd19 car-t, we've seen very good data in the early phases, which we'll present at ash, along with our multiple myeloma next phase car-t therapy.
and we plan to start the pivotal studies in 2022. so, moving to the next slide. just wanted to say a few words on remibrutinib. this, i think, is a really well-designed medicine.
we have excellent chemistry at novartis. and our scientists have worked to really create a highly selective, potent, and safe covalent btk inhibitor. and when you look at the data in csu, we're the first btk inhibitor to be able to demonstrate the kind of data that you see on these slides. first, a very good dose response with significant improvements versus placebo.
and you can see the statistics here are very compelling with no safety signals. then when you look at the improvements in the relevant urticaria score over placebo, you can see across the dose range, we see a clear improvement versus placebo. and that improvement was very rapid as early as week 1 and maintained through week 12, the endpoint of the study. moving to slide 17.
when you look at the complete control that patients on remibrutinib bid were able to achieve versus the placebo group, very high response rates that were consistently maintained over the course of the study, i think, showing the potency of the drug. but in terms of differentiation, particularly in dermatology, as well as in multiple sclerosis, we were really pleased with the safety profile of this medicine, which we think will be critically important. one, there was no dose-dependent increases or treatment interruptions or discontinuations due to lft elevations, no dose-dependent cytopenias or treatment interruptions for low blood cell counts, and no clinically relevant adverse events associated with what have been historically associated with the btk inhibitor class across the entire dose range tested. so overall, we think this is a potential best-in-class profile for csu, positive benefit-risk in those phase 3 studies are in the midst of starting right now.
moving to slide 18. and as mentioned, we're now initiating phase 3 trials with remibrutinib. we understand that we are behind some of our competitors. but we believe our expertise in conducting large-scale rrms studies gives us the ability to close the gap.
and importantly, we think for neurologists, what's really important is they have a very safe medicine that is also high efficacy, and we think we can deliver that with remibrutinib. and what will this allow us to do? we've already got the all-clear to move ahead into our phase 3 studies. and what this allows us to do over the longer term is build on our multiple sclerosis portfolio, gilenya, mayzent, kesimpta and now adding eventually, assuming success, remibrutinib. so, moving to slide 19.
you also saw in the quarter, kisqali achieved statistically significant os in the monaleesa-2 study, the third study where kisqali in the metastatic setting has demonstrated a significant overall survival benefit, that benefit now up to five years. it's really, we believe, should be the preferred treatment option for these patients given the compelling os data that's been demonstrated. we plan to submit this os data into our labeling in the relevant geographies. moving to slide 20.
i just wanted to say a word as i know there's a lot of interest now in the adjuvant readout, which we expect in 2022. it's on track, fully enrolled. just to remind you, there's some unique elements of this study, one, it includes patients at high and intermediate risk, which is a larger patient population than some of our competitor studies. and the way we have designed the study, it's to base enrollment on the prognostic staging from the ajcc.
a little bit different than the ki-67 that has gotten a lot of attention, but we believe and with regulatory sign-up, a very relevant prognostic staging to really ensure that we enrich for the risk of recurrence in this study. we have a longer treatment duration of three years versus two years. we lowered the dose to make sure this was manageable for patients in the adjuvant setting to overall improve the tolerability. so, as i said, enrollment complete.
it's an event-driven study. we expect the late '22 readout. and feedback from fda, which we reviewed again, says that the idfs endpoint is acceptable as the primary analysis provided there's no detriment in os. and we're, of course, taking that into account as we see the various readouts over the course of next year.
moving to slide 21. now i wanted to turn to canopy. and if you'll indulge me, i'll just take a few minutes to explain the data that we released yesterday to make sure it's clear. and then we'll, of course, be happy to take your questions.
the canopy program is based on the results we saw in cantos, where we saw 60% to 70% improvement in the incidence and mortality of lung cancer in a cardiovascular trial. this was based on a pretty good understanding that il-1 beta, as well as hscrp, are very relevant in the tumor microenvironment for lung cancer, as well as in other inflammatory cancers. the canopy-2 study was in the second line there. we didn't see any signals of efficacy overall.
and there, of course, as you saw at esmo, the trend was not positive with canakinumab versus the control arm of chemo. in this study, while we did not meet our primary endpoints of os and pfs in previously untreated, locally advanced, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in the overall population, we did see a positive trend though not statistically significant. importantly, we did see potentially clinically meaningful improvements in both pfs and os. these improvements in these prespecified subgroups and biomarker-driven subgroups were nominally statistically significant.
and the upper bound of the confidence interval specifically did not include one. and we saw treatment effects that were meaningful in our view. however, we don't believe at this point in time that this would constitute a fileable program. now what we do believe is these results support the continued study of canakinumab in earlier stages of lung cancer.
we believe they also support further evaluation of pro-tumor inflammation because the signals we saw were meaningful. on canopy-a, the study, we believe, more closely reflects the cantos study, it remains a high-risk study to be clear. but nonetheless, we think it's important to complete this study to really understand if there's a possibility to replicate the remarkable findings of the cantos study. it's so important for patients if we could actually demonstrate that.
now, in addition, we wouldn't want to highlight, as i think there has been confusion about this. in this study, we did not see meaningful differences in the safety profile of the canakinumab arm versus the control arm of pd-1 plus chemo. so that kind of gives you an overview. we would note as well, we have a number of other pro-tumor inflammation medicines, oral medicines, as well as gevokizumab, which is another anti-il-1 agent that has regulatory -- or has loe into the mid-2030s.
and of course, we're evaluating that medicine in a few other cancer settings, and we'll evaluate as well if there is a credible case to do anything further in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. now moving to slide 22. lastly, before handing it over to marie-france, we've accelerated our esg efforts; 29 million patients reached; a next-generation malarial therapy now entering phase 3 studies; a 10-year commitment to really support addressing health inequities and health disparities in the united states; and we've committed to net-zero carbon on top of all of our other environmental commitments using science-based targets to achieve by 2040 and consistent with many of our other large companies that we'll be announcing these at top 26. and with that, i will hand it over to marie-france.
marie-france tschudin -- president
thank you, vas. so, moving on to slide 24. good morning, good afternoon to all. it's my pleasure to share the results of the pharmaceuticals division for q3.
sales grew 8% this quarter, driven by a clear focus of our launch drivers, our growth drivers and supported by the solid execution across geographies. as you can see, the growth drivers and launches have strong momentum. we're growing 32% and now they account for 54% of sales. this is 10 points above prior year and in line with our strategy.
looking at year to date, you can see us accelerating our momentum, and we're on track to have a strong finish to the year. moving on to slide 25. cosentyx grew 22% with solid contribution from both dermatology and rheumatology. in the u.s., we're growing volume with the market.
we're holding our leadership position in europe. and in china, we're leveraging our nrdl listing. china is now our third biggest market. we've also strengthened our evidence base with multiple pediatric indications, further reinforcing the proven efficacy and safety of cosentyx.
to maintain our momentum in q4 and beyond, we remain focused on our competitiveness in the field, the flawless execution of our marketing teams, and the activation of two key groups of patients: those with pso/psa comorbidity that need strong efficacy in both skin and joints and the axial spa patients who can benefit from all-in-one release. so, i move on to slide 26. while cosentyx has been on the market for six years, every year is a launch year. cosentyx has approved across five indications, all of them have low biologic penetration.
with a strong value proposition and evidence base, cosentyx will continue to capture growth. cosentyx is also the only il inhibitor with nrdl listing in china. we see strong growth potential in this market. we have an ambitious life-cycle management plan, which is starting to deliver.
we've seen positive readouts for giant cell arthritis and our iv formulation in q3. we also expect data for hidradenitis suppurativa in q4. overall, we're looking at a potential of 10-plus indications in areas of high unmet need and an ambition to double the number of patients on cosentyx. this gives us confidence that we can grow cosentyx to at least $7 billion.
moving on to slide 27. entresto grew 44% in the quarter, reaching $2.6 billion year to date. the acc and esc first-line recommendations for entresto are translating into penetration gains. and the expanded u.s.
label is driving nbrx growth and uptake in primary care. in asia, china continues to deliver strong growth on the back of our nrdl listing, and japan is gaining traction. both have acceleration potential based on our recent approvals in hypertension. as we pull through the u.s.
and the eu guideline recommendations and promote the expanded label in the u.s., we're well set up to maintain growth in q4. on slide 28, if we think about the future story of entresto, it continues in line with our existing trend. we know that there remains significant patient potential. we have 4 million patients on treatment with entresto today, yet 70% of eligible patients can still benefit.
in the u.s., where we have a broad chronic heart failure label, 85% of addressable patients are still on prior standard of care, and that makes ace and arb our clear competitive focus. with the recent guideline changes positioning entresto in first line, we now have an opportunity to drive broader and earlier adoption of entresto globally. so overall, we're bullish about the continued growth of entresto to at least $5 billion. if i move on to slide 29, zolgensma had a strong quarter and has just surpassed $1 billion in sales for the year.
in the u.s., we're treating over 90% of babies according to our label due to the high rates of newborn screening. in europe, we had strong uptake in germany and italy, and we saw a bolus of sales in the u.k. following reimbursement. we expect we've seen the bulk of this in q3, but we have also reached agreement on reimbursement in russia and a number of smaller eu markets.
so, if we look ahead, we see four key drivers of future growth: new markets with egypt, saudi arabia, beneluxa expected to contribute in q4; increasing newborn screening so that we can treat patients early on when the benefit of gene therapy is the greatest; heavier patients, our smart study aims to drive confidence in zolgensma's value across the full eu label; and intrathecal. following the alignment of our phase 3 study design, we're now one step closer to bringing it to patients aged two to 18 and thus ultimately address the full spectrum of sma. if i move on to slide 30, while the multiple sclerosis market has contracted quarter over quarter, kesimpta grew 56%. importantly, kesimpta has been a strong driver of the dynamic b-cell market with an additional 1,000 patients on treatment.
our strategy remains focused on three elements: increasing familiarity, we're maintaining a high share of voice, and we've added more than 500 prescribers versus q2; driving further clinical differentiation, we just presented three and a half years of igg data at ectrims, and we're generating evidence on switching and patient-reported outcomes needed to change clinical practice; we're also focusing on customer experience, ensuring fast onboarding and broad access to make it easy to initiate patients. we continue to see more than 50% of our uptake in first line for switch, and we know how important this is because this is where we can have the highest impact on progression and long-term outcomes. we see huge potential in this b-cell market, and we're driving the growth in the dynamic segment. we have the right strategy, and we're going to take further share as the market rebounds.
moving on to slide 31. on leqvio, you most certainly saw that we received nice approval, and we're currently working to implement our broad-reaching commercial agreement with nhs england. we have also been fully focused on the upcoming u.s. launch.
we're working closely with healthcare systems to prioritize ascvd to identify patients to set up buy-and-bill. and we're also leveraging our entresto sales force to educate on the unmet need in ascvd. for customers who may not want buy-and-bill, we're creating a network of alternative injection centers where patients can receive leqvio. we've signed up more than 1,000 centers and expect them to become a significant factor in pulling through our demand early on.
we're also ensuring we generate the right evidence needed to succeed in the u.s. market. based on our engagement, we expect the majority of the 200 prioritized healthcare systems to start treating patients in 2022. the uptake will be skewed to the second half of the year when the majority of the system should be ready for buy-and-bill and our permanent j code should be issued.
we're working with diligence. we're taking a long-term perspective on what needs to be done to transform how ascvd is treated to make leqvio one of the biggest medicines for novartis. in summary, we continue to execute against our strategy, maximize our growth drivers, deliver our launches, and prepare for the next wave of products. the teams are working with a strong sense of urgency and purpose to be more customer-focused, so we can bring our innovation to more patients faster.
i want to thank the teams around the world for their commitment and show my confidence in the continued momentum for a strong year-end. now let me hand it over to susanne.
susanne schaffert -- chief executive officer, novartis oncology
thank you, marie-france. moving to slide 33. the oncology business delivered a solid quarter, growing 5% versus prior year with sales of $3.9 billion. our growth drivers, as well as recent launches, performed well with 16% growth versus previous year, driven by jakavi, promacta/revolade, and kisqali.
together, these products now contribute to more than half of the overall oncology sales. in the third quarter, we have seen healthcare systems in oncology slowly returning back to normal as patient visit, diagnosis, and treatment rates are gradually improving. we are seeing that new patient starts continue to accumulate and expect this translate into growth acceleration in segments like recent launches and hospital-administered products by the end of the year. moving to slide 34.
kisqali delivered strong performance in the third quarter, growing 27% with sales of $230 million. the uptake was mainly driven by continued very strong momentum and patient share gains ex u.s., particularly in europe. we achieved market-leading position with 40% patient share in premenopausal patients in the eu4 and u.k. it is a doubling in patient share since we reported overall survival results from monaleesa-7.
in the u.s., kisqali grew 5% versus previous year, driven by increased demand in pre- and post-menopausal patients, with usage shifting to earlier lines of therapy, which is very encouraging. and as you heard from vas, we are very excited about the new os data for monaleesa-2 that showed the longest overall survival ever reported in advanced breast cancer, achieving a median overall survival of over five years. we believe that such impressive results are the evidence of kisqali's ability to change tumor biology to enable a better response to endocrine-based therapy. kisqali is now the only cdk4/6 inhibitor with proven os benefit across all three phase 3 trials of the monaleesa program with different endocrine therapy partners regardless of menopausal status or line of therapy.
therefore, with a lot of confidence in kisqali, we have started a collaboration with solti and initiated a phase 3 trial called harmonia to evaluate ribociclib versus palbociclib in patients with aggressive her2-enriched intrinsic subtype of hr-positive her2 advanced breast cancer. as vas said, we are also very excited about the ativan natalee study that is exploring kisqali in both intermediate and high-risk population. and this would have the potential to more than triple patients of the metastatic setting. natalee study completed enrollment ahead of schedule in second quarter of this year, and we are looking forward to a readout in 2022.
moving to the next slide. i am pleased to share with you that our two blockbusters in the hematology franchise, promacta/revolade, and jakavi, continue to deliver very strong double-digit performance, driven by strong demand across all regions. promacta/revolade is our thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for use in itp and severe aplastic anemia. the brand continued to perform very strongly, driven by sustained efficacy, oral convenience, and nonimmunosuppressive profile.
in the u.s. alone, we have seen 10% increase in new patient starts versus previous year and expecting that further uptake will be fueled with the expansion of the u.s. indication to include persistent itp. ex u.s., revolade is also performing strongly, driven by increased use in both indications and also additional demand from china.
jakavi is our drug inhibitor and the standard of care in myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera and has also demonstrated impressive growth with significant uptake coming from earlier use in both indication and strong momentum in china. we have completed filings in acute and chronic graft versus host disease in the eu and are actively preparing for launches in 2022. so overall, i'm very pleased with the performance of these two important hematological brands and the potential they have in terms of future growth and patient benefit. moving to slide 36.
i would like to update you on how we are preparing for the upcoming launches of asciminib and lu-psma-617. asciminib is our stamp inhibitor that has the potential to transform the standard of care in cml. in the phase 3 ascembl study, asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response rate at 24 weeks compared to bosutinib. asciminib is well-positioned for launch in third-line cml as we are preparing to leverage our broad commercial footprint and the established collaboration with the hematology community.
we are pleased to see a very high prelaunch awareness of 80% among dermatologists. we have completed fda and ema filing earlier in june. the u.s. fda has granted two breakthrough therapy designations and fast track designation for asciminib and is reviewing the file under real-term oncology review with approval expected early next year.
and just to remind you that asciminib has blockbuster potential in the third line. but we are also seeing opportunity to address the unmet need in first-line cml, and therefore, have initiated a phase 3 study of asciminib versus investigator-selected tkis with final readout expected in 2024. another exciting asset that we are preparing to launch is our radioligand therapy, lutetium-psma-617 that has demonstrated significant os and rpfs benefit in advanced metastatic prostate cancer. our awareness campaign on psma and phenotypic precision medicine is progressing well with the awareness among target physicians doubling over the last 12 months.
our focus is on the top 200 treatment centers and education about process optimation, as well as on treatment site expansion to ensure site readiness at launch. we completed filing with fda. and in addition to breakthrough therapy designation, also received priority review with pdufa date in the first half of 2022. in addition, we have completed filing to fda for registration of our own gallium psma-11 pet kit to further support availability of imaging agents.
and submission of both lutetium-psma and gallium psma pet to the ema is on track. so, we are moving with confidence into earlier lines of therapy and have initiated two phase 3 studies with lutetium-psma in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and in pre-taxane metastatic prostate cancer. so overall, very much looking forward to bringing these two assets to market. and with that, i hand over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, susanne. good morning and good afternoon, everyone. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.
and as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. so, on slide 38, we see the summary of our operational performance for the third quarter and the first nine months, very solid quarter 3 with strong performance of our innovative medicines division. as we had anticipated, the business is normalizing post covid-19 with group sales up 5% and core operating income growth of 9%. quarter 3 net sales reached $13 billion, driven by the innovative medicines growth drivers.
core operating income of $4.5 billion was driven by higher sales and productivity programs across the business. core eps was up 11% to $1.71, and free cash flow grew very strongly by plus 64% in u.s. dollar to $4.4 billion. year-to-date performance reflects the slower growth in the first half of the year mainly due to the impact of covid in certain parts of our business.
we grew top and bottom line 4%, and core eps grew 7% to $4.88. and free cash flow was $10.3 billion, growing 23% in u.s. dollars. next slide, please.
on slide 39, i want to break down our performance by division. and as mentioned, the solid performance of the company was driven by innovative medicines, which delivered a strong quarter with 7% top-line growth, 13% bottom-line growth, and a margin of almost 38%. looking to the first nine months for the year, innovative medicine showed a healthy growth of 6% on top line and 8% on the bottom line with margins of 37%. i'd just like to remind you of the seasonality of margins.
as you know, the fourth quarter has usually the lowest margin due to higher spending phasing. innovative medicines' year-to-date performance was driven by continued strong double-digit growth of the key brands, vas and marie-france and susanne mentioned, with $3.5 billion sales, growing 18% for cosentyx, entresto with $2.6 billion, growing 41%. zolgensma reached already $1 billion in sales. the kesimpta launch was accelerating.
additionally, the onco key growth drivers continue to do very well. moving to sandoz. nine months performance reflects a heavier impact from covid than in the other parts of the business. however, in quarter 3, sandoz has seen some recovery, particularly ex u.s., where sales grew 3%, driven by both biopharmaceuticals and retail generics.
u.s. sales were impacted by double-digit price erosion, partnership terminations, as well as higher off-contract sales in the prior year. the u.s. continues to be a challenging business environment for the wider generics market.
however, we expect the situation to improve also in the u.s. in the midterm as the impact of covid-19 lessens and our biosimilar launches begin to deliver. on slide 40, i just want to highlight the impressive growth we have seen free cash flow, which is now $10.3 billion for the first nine months, up 23% compared to the prior year. the main drivers of this have been higher operating income, lower payment from legal matters compared to what we had last year, and favorable working capital.
now turning to our full-year guidance on slide 41. overall, for the group, we confirmed the current guidance. for sales, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit growth. and for the bottom line, we expect mid-single-digit growth ahead of sales.
for innovative medicines and sandoz, we are confirming the top-line guidance, but we are fine-tuning our bottom-line guidance. we continue to expect innovative medicines division sales to grow mid-single digits. reflecting the strong performance of the division, we have revised upwards core operating income guidance, which we now expect to grow high single digit. for sandoz, we continue to expect sales to decline in the low to mid-single-digit range, but we now expect core operating income to decline mid- to high teens.
the key assumption for the guidance is that we see a continuation of the return to normal global healthcare systems and prescription dynamics in the remainder of the year. and in addition, we continue to assume that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics enter the u.s. market in 2021. next slide, please.
we thought it might be helpful to you to outline our expectations for the fourth quarter. in short, we expect a similar growth in quarter 4 as we had it in quarter 3, with the top line growing the mid-single-digit range and bottom line growing high single digits. taking into account our year-to-date 4% growth both for top and bottom line, this brings us to our full-year guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth for sales and mid-single-digit growth for the core operating income line. finally, on slide 43.
as currencies are constantly changing, i want to bring to your attention the estimated impact currencies would have on our results using the current exchange rates. so if late october rates prevail for the remainder of 2021, the full-year impact of currencies would be a positive 2 points on both sales and core operating income. for quarter 4, it would be negative 1% point on sales and between 0% and negative 1% point on core operating income. and as a reminder, we always update these impacts of the currencies on our website on a monthly basis.
and with that, i hand it over back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. so, moving to slide 45. we did want to give you an update on some of the events we'll be holding later this year and into next year. based on feedback from our investors, we've decided to convert our december 2 event, our capital markets day, to a focused r&d event on innovative medicines.
here, we'll go over our r&d asset, life-cycle management programs, our mid-stage portfolio in each of our key therapeutic areas, as well as have our numerous scientists on hand to discuss our technology platforms and other efforts within nibr. and on may 23 and 24 of 2022, we'll plan for a meet novartis management event, which we hope to hold in person. so, moving to slide 46. in closing, a solid quarter, strong performance from innovative medicines.
we braced our peak sales guidance, really demonstrating our confidence in the long-term growth of the company. we remain confident in the pipeline, in the launch brands to fuel our growth not only in the midterm but also with our science-based intervention for the longer term. and we've announced a strategic review of sandoz, a leading business in generics, operating in an attractive market, but this is the right moment to really evaluate who is the best owner for that business for the long term. so, thank you very much for listening, and we'll open the line up for questions.
i would say to each of our questioners, if you would limit yourself to one question and then move back into the queue, we can do our best to accommodate everyone's questions. so with that, operator, please open the line.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of graham parry from bank of america. please ask your question.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. so, it's on natalee and your comments on the slide that you've rereviewed the fda feedback and that invasive disease-free survival is acceptable as a primary endpoint provided no detriment to overall survival. and that seems contrary to how it's treated lilly's verzenio, where they were asking for more os data to see if the curves are separating. so, can you just clarify when was that feedback given? and why do you think fda could treat kisqali differently from verzenio? and are you stratifying by ki-67 score as well given the fda was also interested in or only approved in that biomarker population for verzenio? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham. john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
yes. thanks for the question, graham. and we did have discussions with the fda on our natalee trial. as you know, we increased the sample size for our natalee trial, knowing the criteria that we've included for the overall study population.
these discussions were recent. i would say that it was within the end of the third quarter where we had these discussions, and they gave us very clear feedback that the design and the endpoints actually would be supportive based on the invasive dfs endpoint given that, obviously, the results would be based upon the overall totality of the evidence that's available. as vas disclosed earlier and shared with you, we have looked at the overall patient population. we've looked at the overall population focused on intermediate and high-risk patients in this study, which is based on the ajcc criteria.
that also includes biomarkers and gene expression tests to select the high-risk patient population overall. so, what we also know is based on the intermediate-risk population, the idfs rates are similar in this intermediate-risk population as in the high-risk population. so based on the overall totality of the background here, we're very confident in our approach.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
maybe just wanted to -- i think you asked specifically. we do collect ki-67 data in the study. but right now, that's not part of our statistical analysis plan. and of course, we'll share that data with the fda when requested.
thanks, graham. next question.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of peter welford from jefferies. please ask your question.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. yes, thanks for taking my question. just on the sandoz strategic review, i wonder if you can give us some insights into perhaps what internally there are metrics that you're perhaps assessing or looking at during the course of next year and also whether or not there's still the aim to both, i guess, return this business to growth but also still potentially put the margins back on a positive trajectory before the business is separated. or if you now believe that the u.s.
oral solids business is now essentially in terminal decline, and that business is not a business that you feel is appropriate to be part of novartis? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, peter. so, i think, as always, and as we learn through our alcon review as well, we consider a number of factors. one, of course, is the synergies between our innovative medicines business and sandoz business, as well as the dyssynergies between holding both of these businesses. we also consider, i think, capital allocation and capital allocation measures to ensure we're optimally allocating capital to maximize shareholder returns.
we, of course, want to consider what would enable us to build the best generics company at the aspiration to be a leading generics company in the world and which setup would best enable that. so, i mean, those are all in broad strokes, the factors. and i think you saw with the alcon spin that we're adaptive at understanding these factors, hopefully, making the best decision for our shareholders and the relevant businesses and then taking the relevant actions. harry, anything you want to add?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
i think, peter, of course, all of the other details, right, the different options have different tax implications. if it would not be retaining the business, all of those, you would expect that we would, of course, always consider. but i think all of this will be part of our strategic review. and i think fundamentally, the question comes down to who's the best owner of this very good generic business.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
maybe richard on the growth profile. richard?
richard saynor -- chief executive officer, sandoz
yeah. thank you, vas. i mean, peter, you commented about the u.s. i mean, clearly, the u.s.
business, we've just had very few launches in terms of oral solids over the last year, 18 months. and clearly, we're watching out a number of the partnership deals as well. the medium, long term looks much more attractive, both as we accelerate the number of small-molecule launches. but also, more importantly, we bring a number of biosimilars to the marketplace over the next three, four years, which should materially change the direction of the business, both in the u.s.
it's also worth noting that the european business now is back into growth as is our international business. so broadly, it's starting to normalize post covid.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please ask your question.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. question for john, relates to canakinumab. john, if i remember in cantos, the early separation of the curve, the treatment effect that we saw with canakinumab was attributed to occult metastatic disease in these patients. with that in mind, assuming it is a viable mechanism, should we expect an interim analysis to read out positively? and if it doesn't, we should, therefore, assume the probability of success is very low.
and then separately, perhaps you could comment on whether even there's any role for this drug given this is an increasingly well-served indication, meaning the adjuvants with tecentriq, tagrisso, and more indication -- more drugs on the way. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. andrew, i'll take it, obviously, because i was one year with the cantos study when i was development head. so, in that result, i think, first and foremost, it's important to note that the cantos study had an inclusion criteria of two milligrams of per dl of hscrp. the median was in that kind of two to five range in the overall study population.
our hypothesis at the time was that these were undetected cancers, cancers were -- that were not detected in the screening, either through physical diagnosis or imaging that in the course of the study, canakinumab was able to reduce the incidence of these cancers becoming fulminant and the mortality of these patients. this, we believed, was due to il-1 beta's role in the tumor microenvironment and il-1 beta potentially having a role in enabling and blocking il-1 beta, enabling immune cells to enter the cancer and therefore, potential synergistic effect in the metastatic setting. and in the adjuvant setting, that in the initial stages of a tumor's development, that il-1 beta plays an important role. so, i don't think that an interim read on this is going to be meaningful.
i think the study was going to have to go to the end. we believe the positioning of the medicine is very much -- the canakinumab, in our view, has a very favorable safety profile given the long experience we have treating children with this medicine who find it very well tolerated. we didn't see any differences in this first-line setting. and so having the potential, and i would say it's high risk, to be clear, of an all-comers therapy for the adjuvant setting that does not require any pd-1 screening could be attractive.
now whether physicians choose an il-1 beta therapy or a pd-1 inhibitor, that will all have to be figured out. but it's important to note as well the adjuvant canopy-a study is an all-comers based on what we knew at the time from the cantos study and is the lowest crp group of these studies in terms of the median crp levels and the enrolled patients, most consistent with the cantos study. thank you, andrew. next question, operator.

hello. thank you very much. just on your new entresto peak sales guidance, does that $5 billion number capture the possibility of an loe earlier than the 2025 anchor date that we've been talking about so far? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president
yes. so, for our internal forecasting assumptions, we're looking at 2025, and that's how we've forecasted. so, if you'd like a little bit more detail on why we feel comfortable with the $5 billion-plus on entresto, it's really based on the significant market potential, the further implementation of guidelines, and obviously, the recent launches in asia. and that leads us to a $5 billion-plus mark, but that is assuming, for internal guidance, a 2025 loe.

simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thanks so much. question for susanne on lu-psma. i was wondering if you are pursuing on the diagnostics side, a technetium psma imaging kit. because the feedback that we've had from radiologists over here is that there is a huge excitement in the u.k.
about the psma. but there is some concern that its utility beyond large centers because of the need for gallium psma screening will make it harder to use more broadly. i just wondering if that's feedback you've seen elsewhere, if you're looking at using the much more easy to administer, if not quite so impressive technetium psma kit in order to broaden the number of centers that can practically use it. thanks so much.
susanne schaffert -- chief executive officer, novartis oncology
so, thank you, simon, for the question. so, we have focused on gallium psma really to have this ready for launch. and we wanted to make sure that there is a diagnostic available. you see the other options also focus on gallium.
and then i think there is quite a push for fluoride psma diagnostic as this is still, i would say, across the g-7 markets, the most used diagnostics. i think technetium is quite focused in the u.k. i didn't hear so much about that, ex u.k. and i mean, as we are targeting earlier lines of therapy, you have to see that we really have a diagnostic available that is very easily available and that's certainly the fluoride one.
so that's what we are focusing on. and probably technetium is quite focused in the u.s. -- sorry, in the u.k.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, susanne. and i just wanted to take a step back. i have to clarify a comment i made to graham's question. for natalee, we are collecting ki-67.
it's in about 70% to 80% of the total enrolled patients. it's part of the statistical analysis plan, but not a prespecified stratification factor. so, with that, we'll move to the next question.

keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thank you for the question. one on leqvio, please. marie-france, kind of you spoke about the confidence in leqvio launch and the preparedness for that going into 2022.
kind of the clarity around what you partnered with nhs in england still remains very kind of dim or very unclear. so just wondering if you can give us a bit more details on how we should think about the rollout of this molecule in the u.k. and then just in the same vein, i think consensus is looking at about $250 million in revenue for this drug next year. do you think that appropriately reflects what you see as the launch dynamics for this? or should we be thinking about something lower or higher than $250 million for like next year? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president
all right. so, thanks for the question and the opportunity to talk about leqvio. so, on the u.k., first of all, we're very happy with the positive nice approval and the commitment from the nhs to fund and treat 300,000 ascvd patients. i think this provides solid proof that we can get the broad access prior to the outcomes data and based on the back of, obviously, solid evidence around ldl-c lowering.
so, what we're doing right now in the u.k., and this is going to be the focus for the next couple of months, is really identify patients and work on the care pathways to reach 1,200 gp networks. it's early days, but we're doing -- we're having -- we're seeing really great progress around central funding, the digital patient ids, the incentives for gps, and the educational programs. and the feedback from lipid specialists and gps has also been very positive. so, we expect a slow ramp in q4.
but you can expect to see some significant ramp-up in q1 of next year for the u.k. if i then turn to the u.s., again, here, we're focusing on the 200 systems of care. and as we said, we're also looking to build buy-and-bill. the first half of the year is going to be focused on our j-code, building up the buy-and-bill infrastructure, going through the p&t reviews, and making sure that we're ready.
and then you'll see that uptick toward the second half of the year. and the number you quoted, we feel extremely comfortable with that number for next year.

your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim securities. please ask your question.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
oh, great. thanks so much. just a quick question. i noticed that your g12c agent moved into or is planned to move into phase 3.
can you just help us understand the data that prompted the planned advancement of the kras g12c inhibitor? and then just as a follow-on to that, do you think this asset can differentiate meaningfully from other therapies on its own? or is the differentiation really key to near-term development in combination with your shp2 inhibitor. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, seamus. i'll hand that to john. john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
seamus, thanks for the question. and our kras g12c, which is jdq433 in our program, we've advanced this molecule forward and plan to have phase 3 in place by the first half of next year. what we've seen is really good pk/pd data and good tolerability by the patients. as we move forward, you'll be hearing more about this in the congresses next year.
on your specific question about the strategy moving forward and differentiation versus the other kras g12cs and potential marketplace and in the marketplace now, we think that the approach for kras g12c is really in combinations. what we've seen so far is that you are getting -- the durability is probably not as long as what we would like and that we're seeing mutations. and with those mutations, it will be a combination approach. and these combinations could be a number of factors, including our potential tno shp2 in our pipeline.
you'll be hearing about that combination from our pipeline next year also.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of sarita kapila from morgan stanley. please ask your question.
sarita kapila -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so, if you could help us understand the rationale for taking your btk inhibitor or any break forward in csu, especially when ligelizumab is being trialed in this setting also? and how are you thinking about positioning of the two assets relative to one another and also to the pacing? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question. john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
yeah. so remibrutinib, as you probably have seen, is highly our selective and potent covalent oral btk inhibitor. we did do an extensive phase 2 program in csu, which was recently released. and what we saw is really good uptake, and the efficacy was extremely strong.
now what we've seen is the efficacy was seen both at four weeks and at 12 weeks. and in addition to that, we saw efficacy very early at the one-week time point. so, really strong efficacy data, pin back on the safety profile, which as we think about btk inhibitors, sometimes are saddled with lfts, also cytopenias, and we did not see that in our overall program. so given our approach, we're very comfortable advancing csu into our phase 3 program.
now one thing we should also note is ligelizumab, we've seen phase 2 results, which were equally strong. and the approach that we're taking here is ligelizumab would be giving patients an opportunity at [inaudible] week treatment with a subcu injection. and then remibrutinib would be an oral opportunity given the large, massive unmet need in csu patient population. that's our overall approach.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and i think marie-france could add a few more points. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president
yes. so just maybe going back to the size of the market and the unmet need. so, we know there are about 1.3 million csu patients who are inadequately controlled in the top 11 markets. in fact, these patients are on antihistamines and steroids and really almost considered the sort of forgotten or unwanted patients.
so, we really want to make a difference in this space. of course, we have a potentially strongly differentiated asset with ligelizumab and an opportunity to increase the biologic penetration. we also have a strong footprint, right, not only with dermatologists, but don't forget that we work with xolair in the u.s. and so, we have the strong relationships with allergists as well.
and then bringing oral to market would really sort of complete the picture and make it perhaps an attractive first option post-antihistamine for csu patients. so, we're very excited about this space. we think we can build on the legacy that we've already built and make a real difference for these patients.

thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, jo. i'll hand it over to richard. richard?
richard saynor -- chief executive officer, sandoz
thank you, jo. as you know, we don't normally disclose specific details of our programs. what i will say is we intend to launch six biosimilars in both the u.s. and europe over the next few years, which will start rapidly accelerating our business.
and currently, we have over 15 and expanding number of projects, both in-house developments or through partnership deals that we intend to launch in the coming years. so, clearly, as we go through the process and at whatever time is appropriate, we'll give greater clarity in terms of the makeup of that. but obviously, it's relatively sensitive in terms of recent disclosure.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i think the only point i would add is i think sandoz does its best to cover the major loes. i think there really is another wave of loes in this kind of '24 beyond standpoint in biologics. and with an increasing interest in the u.s. to enable biosimilars to fully participate, i think it's a tremendous opportunity for the sandoz business.

richard vosser -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. just going on to cosentyx. obviously, this year, we had some formulary disruptions, which you navigated very well.
maybe you could give us an idea how the discussions have gone for '22. and is that a normalization? have you said that you can see volume growth coming through or managed to win back any positioning? thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president
so, thank you, richard. so, you're absolutely right. in the u.s., we've seen strong value growth versus previous year due to this access change. what we have seen now in q3 is quarter-over-quarter volume growth, and that's in line with the market.
so, we do expect volume growth to be the growth driver in the u.s. for 2022. we also expect our access position to stay stable. and we do believe that most major key payers will have us on formulary.
so ultimately, what we need to do in the u.s. next year is really focus on our strengths, which is our existing markets. i talked about the focus on the pso/psa comorbid patients. there are two-thirds of the patients that have additional manifestations.
and we have a really broad body of evidence in this space, the axial spa patients. and then, of course, preparing for iv, which could be a significant opportunity in the u.s. 14% to 18% of these patients are on medical benefit for psa. and then, of course, our hidradenitis suppurativa, 220,000 patients in the u.s., so significant opportunities to prepare for in 2023.

richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. it's just on business development and m&a, you've been relatively quiet this year. so i'm just wondering if you could talk about your appetite for m&a based on opportunities out there and valuations and maybe thoughts on capital allocation if there weren't sort of near-term opportunities and thinking about buyback and when a decision might be made on that.
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. richard, you know, overall, we remain with our capital allocation priorities as we always laid out, investment in the organic business, growing dividend, as you have seen in march coming in over $7 billion. and then, of course, bolt-on m&a and in-licensing where we did the in-license of tislelizumab for $650 million. and we have continuously, of course, screen the market, and we continue to look opportunistically for bolt-on m&a opportunities that fit our franchises and existing infrastructures, if you will.
but of course, they won't happen every year. therefore, that's why we say up to. and from that standpoint, not a formula. but we continue to be basically on that path.
and then from a share buyback standpoint, as you know, we always buy back the employee participation program as we did this year to never dilute our shareholders. and we finished in the first half, a $2.5 billion program that we announced end of last year. so, we're working along those lines on our capital allocation, and no change in our m&a and bd strategy.

your next question comes from the line of naresh chouhan from intron health. please ask your question.
naresh chouhan -- intron health -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. just one on sandoz, please. you mentioned that sandoz was more integrated into novartis than alcon was. it would be really helpful if you could quantify the size of these synergies in fully separating sandoz out to allow us to kind of value any value creation from a separation or a sale? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. naresh, that's, of course, what a strategic review will inform us about. and that's why we take some time to do that very thoroughly. and there are -- i would say there are two components to this.
also, if i compare this to the alcon situation, as we analyzed, and of course, no decision made at all. so, it could also be the decision of retaining. but also, in the case of the separation, i would say it's probably a bit easier at the moment because richard and steffen lang and our technical operations team and the sandoz team are focused on making the manufacturing and supply chain as autonomous as possible over the last two, three years. and that basically has been completed and within novartis.
so there, we are probably ahead of where we were when we announced alcon. on the other hand, of course, the business has been built over 20 years plus with acquisitions and system-wise fully integrated, where alcon probably was a bit more separate as it was shorter with the company. so, we have a couple of head tailwinds, but that's why doing such reviews takes that time and we indicate that in a good year, we will give an update. if things go a bit faster, we come earlier, but this is operationally complex.
and of course, we have to exactly figure out synergies, dyssynergies, potential standup costs, tax considerations, as well as separation costs.

good afternoon, everyone. thank you so much for taking my question. a quick one on asciminib. was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on your strategy in first line because you are just starting the clinical program, how you will profit this product versus the pretty good already existing drugs.
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
susanne?
susanne schaffert -- chief executive officer, novartis oncology
yeah. thank you, florent. as you heard us, we are quite excited about asciminib, to get this prepared for launch in third line. as you show, we saw remarkable results versus bosutinib in this setting, which tells us that this mechanism of action is very effective.
and we know from medical experts and patients that there is still high need in first line. cml patients really are on a lifelong treatment. and we know that if you have a fast and deep molecular response early on, this could even lead to a treatment-free period, and that's what really experts are aiming for. so, there is the desire to be even better in first line.
and the approach that we take is really to compare it to different tkis. that's why we allow investigator-selected the tki so that we have a broad range of comparator products. and then we have to see -- the focus certainly is then on the deep molecular response. and if we can prove that, certainly, that really has significant potential.
so that's the strategy we're pursuing for asciminib in early lines.

richard wagner -- wolfe research -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you for the questions. this is richard wagner with wolfe research on behalf of tim. a question on sandoz, please.
how does novartis avoid a situation similar to pfizer's upjohn spin where they divest a lower multiple business? now when analysts did a sum of the parts analysis, ended up with a figure that basically suggested the spin was destroying value because the multiple in the upjohn business was lower than that was put on the parent pfizer company. the sandoz spin could end up causing the same thing to us because generic multiples are pretty much always lower than pharma company multiples. so how can novartis mitigate this? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, richard. so first and foremost, i think we're focused on building a strong business with clear sales growth outlook, strong margin outlook, that can be a leading global generics player. i'd also note that when you look in the generic sector, you see a wide range of multiples when you look at specialty generics players, players that are more exposed to europe or asia versus players more exposed to the u.s.
and so that's all of the work we need to do to really understand what is the best way to maximize value for our shareholders, as well as enable sandoz to be as successful as possible. and we have a range, i think, of different options we can look at and as harry rightly pointed out, including retaining the business. so, i don't see it as an analogous situation, especially given that sandoz is the no. 1 generics player in europe, the no.
1 global antibiotics player in the industry, and the no. 1 biosimilar company globally and sales primarily driven by ex-u.s. business. so, relatively low u.s.
exposure, which, in our view, is what drives the lower multiples of some of the peers. so, that's kind of our perspective at the moment, and we'll, of course, update it as we do the assessment. thanks a lot, richard, for the question. next question, operator.

so what you're left able to buy would be great. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer

harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you very much, simon. so overall, we pretty much, i think, close to our authority from the agm, but we do usually do a renewal of it. but overall, when you look over the last years, we have consistently done like -- it's not a formula, again, but roughly $2.5 billion per year or $5 billion every two years.
again, not a formula. it completely has to do with what opportunities do we have basically on m&a and on bolt-on m&a. and then, of course, so from a capital allocation standpoint, the first three priorities are worked through and then, of course, in terms of where the share price is. but it's not only a question of share price, of course, also capital allocation priorities.
and we just finished one. so, from that standpoint, at this moment, we have not announced an additional one.

thank you for the question. and again, this was on remibrutinib. i just wondered what data, if any, you have on cns tissue for remibrutinib. and if you have any brain penetration with it, any evidence of any effect on microglial cells, so that's something which sanofi obviously talks about with tolebrutinib quite a lot.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham. john?
john tsai -- chief medical officer
yes. thanks, graham. we have done some preclinical studies in this area. we have seen cns penetration.
in this early stage, what we don't know is exactly what the extent of the clinical validation and the clinical correlation in the central -- when you actually have central activation in these areas. so given that, what we're confident of overall in remibrutinib is that it's a very clean profile asset, as i've stated earlier, in terms of potency and selectivity. so, we look forward to sharing some of these preclinical data, as well as the overall clinical profile for remibrutinib.

your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. please ask your question.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. maybe some -- back of the queue, take a couple. so, one, the avexis pipeline in neuroscience. it's been a somewhat slow story since the deal announced the setback in rett syndrome today.
if you could just give us a bit more color on that? was that safety or efficacy related? that would be very helpful. and next steps? i think we were anticipating clinical development in friedreich's and als by now, but i don't think you've announced anything to date. and then maybe the second question, if i may, just the shape of '22 looks pretty similar to '21 for you, following loe thereafter. so, i'm thinking low mid-single-digit sales growth with some margin improvement.
perhaps you could give us some initial thoughts on why that statement might be wrong, in particular, heads and tailwinds for next year would be helpful. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. so, thanks, emmanuel. first, on our gene therapy pipeline. first, we have a number of targets that are progressing right now in the clinic, i mean, with the intrathecal now entering into phase 3.
we have a number of ophthalmology programs in the recent optogenetics acquisition. with some of our neuroscience assets, we've decided to optimize our program to ensure that we really get, i think the optimal capsid, as well as insert combination that will enable us to maximize efficacy. we've done extensive profiling work now, and we think that's the prudent course. it doesn't change our commitment to rett syndrome, friedreich's ataxia.
and behind that, we have a number of other programs advancing in monogenic, as well as polygenic neurological diseases. so, as with this field, we're always learning, and this is the case where we learn something more in our preclinical work, and it's making us just take a pause and optimize the program. and then we hope to move that quickly again into the clinic. clearly, these patients need better therapies.
in terms of the shape of '22, it's really, of course, premature for us to comment, but maybe harry could provide any perspective.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. as always, we have the tradition of guiding for next year with our full-year results, end of january. and overall, on the margin progression -- on the margin progression, if that was part of the question, i would expect basically incremental continued improvement over the next years so that we do expect basically sales growth, of course, of next year, as vas has laid out with a 4% cagr roughly. and with that incremental margin improvement, after we have improved the margin almost 300 basis points last year, you see another margin improvement this year.
but, of course, last year was also due to the almost inability to partly promote given the pandemic situation. and on top of that, we have now further improved with excellent productivity programs, resource allocation, and overall, of course, cost consciousness and changing the way we run the company in a more efficient way, taking full advantage of virtual opportunities.

what's going to be so different? and have you sort of solved the problem whereby older people's blood can actually be more effectively manipulated and just have more successful and perhaps faster treatment? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, jo. our teams have done a lot of work, and we've learned a lot since 2015 when we entered this space. we continue to believe that car therapy, cell therapies have a transformational benefit when successfully delivered, as you've seen in the patient populations that are currently licensed and have a tremendous potential. so, we invest in a new approach, which we believe can optimize our cost of goods importantly, which enables us to make a much stronger financial return; optimizes our speed of production, which enables us to flexibilize production, increase scale; but most importantly, hopefully, can generate more durable and deep responses for these patients so that we get higher orrs or crs as is relevant.
and we believe that -- continue to believe that autologous approaches versus allo approaches are the best way to do that. i think our nibr scientists have done an outstanding job. and we'll at least present the first set of data at ash, and then we'll move forward from there. but i think it's worth remembering we have a global footprint in cell therapies, a global capability, and we have the ability given our financial firepower to stay the course and really try to be a long-term industry leader.
next question, operator.
operator
your next question comes from the line of stefan schneider from global. please ask your question.
unknown speaker
yes. hi. thank you. what kind of cough-cold season is captured in your full-year guidance? and maybe in this context, for quarter 4, you're right, could start to return to pre-covid levels in several markets.
can you specify that a bit further, so what several markets do you think of? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
richard, on the cough and cold?
richard saynor -- chief executive officer, sandoz
thank you, stefan. in our guidance, we've assumed, i guess, a more normal cough and cold season in line with previous seasons. so, we've not assumed an exceptional one, but we assumed it in line with previous years. it's worth noting that the previous cough and cold season was pretty much nonexistent due to social distancing and mask-wearing.
but we're seeing that normalizing, a pickup in demand of our anti-infectors business, as well as our otc businesses, certainly in europe and in other markets.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, richard. and i believe we have one last question, operator.
operator
your final question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein. please ask your question.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my question. i believe somebody already asked on the microglial, so can i just ask on kisqali, please? and just a feedback post-monaleesa-2 os benefit. are you really seeing any increased appetite to use the drug versus the other cdk4/6s? and what is your base assumption of the share that you can now capture in the metastatic setting longer term? will this data actually change dynamics? just looking at the volume trends in the u.s., it really seems like relatively modest expansion in share so far.
so how should we think about the next few years? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, wimal. susanne?
susanne schaffert -- chief executive officer, novartis oncology
yeah. thank you for the question. i mean, as you rightly say, the monaleesa-2 data is certainly the biggest segment where we now also could demonstrate os data. and we really hear feedback from medical experts that these are quite impressive data and confirms that there is something differentiated about kisqali.
so, as i said, the last weeks, we see increased demand also in the u.s. and we keep focused on really delivering this method, working on getting this education story through. and we're also quite encouraged that now with covid getting more normalized, that more patients start because that is, of course, certainly what was kind of hindering that, with less patients getting new treatment initiations. there was also less opportunity to grow.
so, we remain confident in kisqali. we will focus on educating. and i believe kisqali is the best-differentiated os or cdk4/6 with strong os. and therefore, we believe we have the confidence for kisqali to remain a significant growth driver.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, susanne. and then harry just had one quick correction.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. i just looked at our remaining share buyback program. so, as we just renewed it recently, it's roughly $8.5 billion. so, we have room but, again, no plans at the moment.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so, to be clear, that's the $8.5 billion authorization from the agm, but no plans at the moment. so, with that, we can close the call. thank you all very much for joining. we look forward to you joining us on december 2, our r&d day, where we'll have our r&d leaders walking through the pipeline, giving you relevant details, hopefully getting your understanding up and hopefully excitement up on our mid- and early stage pipeline.
look forward to that discussion. in the meantime, i wish you all very well. thank you again.

2021-Q4,NVS,2022-02-02 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q4 and full year 2021 results release conference call and live webcast. [operator instructions] the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call, including the q&a session, will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. [operator instructions] with that, i would like to hand over to mr.
samir shah, global head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much. and good morning and good afternoon, everybody. a big thank you for joining us today on our q4 '21 and full year '21 results. the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors.
these may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f and its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that, respectively, were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission. with that, i'll now hand the call to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. moving to slide 3. with me today, i have harry, marie-france, susanne, john, richard, karen. and of course, you've already heard from samir.
now turning to slide 5. and before moving into the quarter, i'd like to just make a few overarching statements about the company, our direction, and our overall profile. we believe we continue to present an attractive profile for investors, a clear strategy as a focused medicines company, powered by technology and technology platforms which we believe will define the future of our sector and the future of medicine; an attractive growth profile, where we're confident in the 4% plus sales cagr that we've guided to, and with the goal to be above peer median beyond 2026, and an aspiration to be in the high 30s im margin, which we're well on our way toward; a strong mid- and late-stage portfolio with over 20 assets with significant peak sales potential; platform leadership, which we continue to work toward across multiple defining platforms in the sector; and a balanced approach to capital allocation, which i'll speak more about in a few slides. now moving to slide 6.
we continued to evolve and sharpen our strategy. we are continuing to look at where to play, with a particular focus now on four key therapeutic areas with two additional therapeutic areas we're selectively participating in; focus on four key geographies while always evaluating our geographic footprint; and aspiration to transform sandoz; five key priorities on how we win, which we continue to focus on and believe, will enable us to outperform the sector over time; and a clear aspiration to be a top-three innovator; be in the high 30s in terms of our im margin; an attractive return on invested capital; and continuing to be one of the leaders in material esg factors in the biopharmaceutical sector. then moving to slide 7. when you look at our track record on our financial performance, our track record, particularly on im, has been solid.
im sales in the last four years have grown 7%. im core operating income has grown 13%, which is among the highest in the sector. our im core margin has now reached 36.2%. and our group free cash flow continues to perform well, and we continue to look at improving our free cash flow generation as a firm.
so i think this demonstrates that we are delivering against the goals we set ourselves, and we plan to continue to do that in the years to come. then moving to slide 8. just as a reminder, over the coming years, we expect to grow that -- at that 4% or better rate, overcoming the estimated $9 billion of potential generic impact that we could have in this period, with a series of strong growth drivers: six major assets which we believe will have multibillion-dollar potential, a strong pipeline which would then be added on top, leading to that 4%. and of course, depending on when the entresto loe falls, the potential to do even better.
so now turning to q4 and on slide 9. in q4, we delivered strong performance across our value drivers. growth was plus 6% in the quarter, with im reaching 7% of sales productivity, continued with group core operating up 12%, im core operating income up 15%. i think demonstrating that productivity power we have within the company.
i'll come back to innovation, but we had important innovation milestones in the quarter. and in terms of our progress on esg, we had improved scores on multiple esg metrics, including the msci, and continued our progress on environment and human rights. so focusing in on growth and turning to slide 10. our key growth drivers grew 24% in the quarter and now represents more than half of the im sales.
we were pleased with the performance on our growth brands, and marie-france and susanne will go through that in a bit more detail. and as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, the steady increase we've had of these growth drivers, constituting more and more of our sales, demonstrating the replacement power of our core sales base that we have within the company. now moving to slide 11. across the six key brands that we're hyper-focused on, we saw a double-digit growth, cosentyx growing 17%, entresto at 40%, zolgensma 46%, and kisqali at 36%.
kesimpta is off to a very strong start on its first full launch year. marie-france will go through that in a bit more detail, but we saw a very strong share gain. and leqvio is in a build year this year. and we expect over the course of this year to consistently build momentum toward an inflection point in the '23 and beyond time period.
as you can see and as we highlighted in our r&d day, these brands are protected, outside of entresto, into the late 2020s, or into the 2030s, forming a strong foundation for the company which we can build on with our pipeline assets. now moving to slide 12. and when you take a geographic view of the business, we had consistent growth across u.s., europe, and china in innovative medicines, driven by different brands in each case. but in the u.s., we continue to show consistent growth, and we have an aspiration to become a top-five player in the u.s.
over time. in europe, we remain the largest pharmaceuticals company, and again, are looking forward now to launching kesimpta and leqvio in the market to continue that growth dynamic. in china, we have been one of the most consistent-growing companies, in the high teens over recent years. and we are confident that we will get to our goal of over $4 billion in sales in china by 2025.
and we'll go through a little bit more on some of the dynamics in china in quarter 4. but we've already seen a recovery from some of the slowdown we saw in q4 due to the buying patterns, the nrdl listings, and some of the other considerations that we have. and we'll speak more about that in the conference call. now moving to slide 13 and turning to innovation.
we had multiple milestones in the quarter. the approvals of scemblix in the u.s. and leqvio in the u.s., importantly, from an approval standpoint. additional submissions, including lu-psma-617 in europe, as well as alpelisib in pros, an opportunity for us to take on a very high unmet need, though small indication.
our readouts. multiple readouts in the quarter, positive data for cosentyx in hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as with iv administration in psoriatic arthritis. ligelizumab readout as well, positive versus placebo, non-inferior versus xolair. we continue to evaluate the path forward for ligelizumab.
and ytb and phe, which i'll speak more about as well, in terms of our novel car-t platform. we began our phase 3 studies for remibrutinib, both in multiple sclerosis and csu, as well as with ligelizumab in food allergy and cold-induced urticaria. now moving to the next slide on slide 14. just a few words on some of the data readouts.
ianalumab is active, we're very excited about. this is our anti-baff receptor monoclonal antibody. had very strong data in sjogren's syndrome in a phase 2b study. we'll be moving into sjogren's phase 3 later this year.
we are all planning as well shortly to initiate studies in phase 3 for lupus nephritis. we're advancing in sle, as well as in autoimmune hepatitis, and expect additional data over the coming 12 months on these two indications. and we're also looking to progress within b-cell malignancies, where we believe an anti-baff receptor antibody could provide an additional option for these patients. taken together, we think this asset has the potential to be the ""pipeline"" in a single asset.
and we look forward to advancing it across a broad range of indications. i already mentioned the cosentyx data in hs. this is a high unmet need area. hidradenitis suppurativa is a severe, debilitating condition.
a good efficacy profile, a strong safety profile. we are keeping the study blinded until the 52-week time point. and following that 52-week safety data, we will then be able to move forward with submissions in the u.s. submissions in the eu are already under preparation, and we would expect them in the first half.
and as i mentioned with ligelizumab, data demonstrated superiority versus placebo, but not superiority versus xolair. and we'll provide a further update on this asset in terms of its progress in csu shortly. however, we do believe there's potential for the medicine in food allergy and cindu, given there is no approved anti-ige therapy in this indication. now moving to slide 15.
just to say a word about the data we recently presented in december. on our t-charge platform, our next-generation car-t platform, which we're excited about, given the potential to provide rapid access to therapy, hopefully improved rates of response and longer durability, as well as attractive economics in terms of its production and scalability. ytb, which is indicated for dlbcl, in a small study of 16 patients, demonstrated a 73% cr rate at month 3. and we're looking forward now to reading out the six-month data over the coming months.
and we plan to start a phase 3 trial in dlbcl this summer for this asset. and phe in multiple myeloma, the bcma-directed car-t. again, early data, but in the first six patients, 100% orr. and what's unique about this technology platform is its ability to preserve what's termed as t cell stemness, the ability of t cells to regenerate themselves to hopefully lead to more long and durable responses if a cancer occurrence should occur.
also, it enables a shortened time frame for cells to be out of the patient's body. so many things to be excited about. early days, but we look forward to taking this forward, and hopefully, over time, bringing additional targets onto the t-charge platform. then moving to slide 16.
in the quarter as well, we signed four additional bd&l deals to strengthen the pipeline. we acquired gyroscope, which has a one-time subretinal, a phase 2 gene therapy, that have the potential to transform the care of geographic atrophy. in early data in nine patients, rather remarkable results that we saw for this one-time administration. we'll now have to see how those results hold up in larger phase 2 studies.
but at least the potential to address a very large market and a very large patient unmet need with a one-time therapy. we signed an option agreement with beigene for ociperlimab, the phase 3 tigit inhibitor, currently being run by beigene in global phase 3 studies in solid tumors, particularly in lung cancer, efcc, and cervical cancer. we are looking forward to working with beigene to fully build out this program over the course of the year; and then as data continues to materialize, determine if a full opt-in would be warranted. we signed our opt-in agreement with molecular partners for ensovibep, which has the potential to be a broad-spectrum coronavirus therapeutic for patients in the outpatient setting.
it has three -- target is the spike protein in three separate binding domains, opportunity for bacterial production. so much higher yields and a much more efficient production, also higher scales. we are on track in our discussions with the fda to complete an emergency use authorization filing. and then it would be determined by a review matter if the fda would ultimately provide an approval.
we also continue to be in discussions with the u.s. government, as well as other governments around the world, regarding this therapeutic, as well as advancing the phase 3 trial and subcutaneous formulation. and then lastly, we signed an agreement with ucb for the co-development and co-commercialization of an alpha-synuclein small molecule inhibitor, now an opportunity to tackle parkinson's disease with a small molecule agent against, i think, a very exciting target. early data, early days, but certainly, the potential to address a major unmet need.
now turning to slide 17. slide 17 and the following slide as well give you an overview, one kind of a snapshot of our portfolio in pharmaceuticals. in cardio-renal, things are on track, and you can see some additional progress we've made on the leqvio outcome studies. and iptacopan and pelacarsen also remain on track.
in neuroscience, zolgensma, we've initiated the phase 3 intrathecal study now. branaplam has also now initiated in its phase 2b study of huntington's disease. i already mentioned remibrutinib and our agent in parkinson's disease. and across the immunology portfolio, a number of ongoing projects and programs in phase 2 and phase 3 all largely on track.
at the bottom, you see the status of our wild card programs. later this year, we would have readouts for qbw and unr. and we continue to also progress the other agents in that box as well. then turning to slide 18.
in oncology, we also are progressing on track in solid tumors and hematology. the kisqali natalee readout is on track for -- it's an event-driven readout, but we continue to expect it by the end of 2022. if the event rate changes and it slips into '23, we'll of course let the markets know. the canopy-a study also is on track for a readout in the second half of this year.
lu-psma, importantly, the additional readout for our psmafore study, again, an event-driven study, but we're hopeful to have a readout on that in the earlier lines of prostate cancer by the end of 2022. and the review of lu-psma with the fda is on track, given its action date later this quarter. and we also progressed jdq with tno. we look forward to presenting additional data on the combination, we hope, over the coming 12 months.
in hematology, the asciminib first-line approval. third-line approval we've already achieved, and susanne will speak more about that. and then i've already mentioned some of the other agents here. sabatolimab, our anti-tim-3, on track for a pfs readout in the first half of this year.
and the various other studies moving toward pfs and os will come over the coming year as well. so a lot going on. we expect additional readouts, particularly in the back half of this year and heading into 2023. when you look at slide 19, you can see the full list of expected events, regulatory decisions, submissions, submission-enabling readouts, additional readouts.
and you can also see a large number of pivotal study starts. these studies will be important for us to continue to advance the 20-plus assets that we've been talking about that will drive growth in 2025 and beyond. so moving to slide 20. just to say also a word on sandoz.
we saw sandoz stabilizing in quarter 4. you saw sales growth plus 2% in the quarter, as well as biopharma growing 7% in constant currencies. when we think about the outlook for 2022, we forecast sales to be broadly in line. and harry will talk a little bit more about the specifics on the guidance.
we're assuming here that cough and cold reverts to pre-covid levels, that biosimilars continues to perform, particularly in europe, where we have a very strong market position. but we also face continued gross margin headwinds due to the price erosion and unfavorable mix, particularly in the u.s., which we expect to fully bottom out in this year and start to move toward a growth dynamic in the back half of next year. our biosimilars launches however continue to be on track. and we're expecting these launches to drive material growth in the back half of 2023, into 2024, and beyond.
there are $80 billion of originator sales, a large opportunity. we have 15-plus assets somewhere in development. so that will be absolutely critical to move sandoz into a strong growth dynamic looking ahead. moving to slide 21.
a word on our capital allocation strategy. we remain disciplined and shareholder-focused and really trying to balance the four elements of our strategy. and this is a shift. we're not ranking them, but rather really showing them as a balanced approach.
we invest in our organic business. you can see $9 billion in r&d, over $1 billion in capital investments. we also continue to look at value-creating bolt-ons. we've done around $30 billion of acquisitions since 2018.
and we also returned value to shareholders through our annual dividend, where we propose this year to increase by 3% swiss francs and 6% in u.s. dollars. and as announced in the quarter 4, we continue to also return our capital to shareholders where appropriate. share buybacks of $2.8 billion were executed in 2021, and we're on track with respect to the $15 billion share buyback program that we announced in the back half of last year, which we expect, given the nature of the swiss second line -- second trading line cancellations, take us until the end of 2023 to fully complete.
so moving to slide 22. from an esg standpoint, we continue to make important progress in sub-saharan africa with respect to our human rights commitments, in terms of disability inclusion. our environmental targets are on track with 34% scope 1 and 2 reductions, excluding offset waste disposal, also reduce and on track to be at half by 2025, all on track toward our goal of being carbon neutral across scopes 1 through 3 by 2030 and fully net 0 by 2040. and sooner -- as soon as possible is our aspiration.
and this has all led to improved scores from an msci. we are no longer having an msci controversy red flag, ranked no. 2 in the access to medicine index and also favorably ranked in the s&p global esg ratings, among other ratings that we've had over the course of the year. so in closing on slide 23.
just wanted to highlight the priorities for the company over the course of the year. the successful launches of leqvio, kesimpta, lu-psma, which we believe has the potential to be a very significant asset, and scemblix, where, again, we have the opportunity to build on a third-line approval and hopefully move into earlier lines of therapy. maintain the growth momentum on our six multibillion-dollar assets that are the assets that we believe will drive the company's base level of growth over the coming years; progressing the pipeline of 20-plus potential significant sales assets, with the opportunity that be approved by 2026; optimize our portfolio with the sandoz review, with a plan to have this updated by the end of 2022; and remain disciplined and thoughtful on our bd and m&a to build the growth profile of the company, but also ensure attractive returns for our shareholders; deliver those returns through our productivity initiatives, especially in manufacturing and business services, as we move toward the high 30s in our margins, as well as an attractive return on invested capital profile; and continue to reinforce the foundations of a great company, a strong culture that drives performance, leadership in data science to drive value across the business and being an esg leader. so thank you very much.
and with that, i'll hand it over to marie-france.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
good morning, good afternoon to all. on slide 25, i'm pleased to share the quarter 4 results of the pharma division with you. our sales grew 9% this quarter. as you know, we're fully focused on our growth drivers and launches and the rejuvenation of our portfolio.
you can expect us to continue to drive this shift in 2022 and beyond. so moving on to slide 26. cosentyx delivered $1.2 billion in revenues and grew 13% in the quarter. we've seen strong demand for cosentyx across geographies.
we did see some impact in china due to the year-end budget caps. however, we've already seen a strong rebound in q1. our life cycle program is starting to deliver, with the positive readout for hidradenitis suppurativa and iv, and will start to be a growth driver in 2023. if we look to 2022, our focus is on volume growth in all geographies, especially china.
in the u.s., our access position is stable and we plan to grow with the market. as we will not benefit from the price favorability we saw last year, volume growth for us is key. you can expect to see the typical quarter-over-quarter decline in q1, followed by continued double-digit growth for the full year, fully on track to deliver on our $7 billion-plus guidance. if i move on to slide 27.
entresto grew 34% in the quarter, finishing the year at $3.5 billion in sales. we continue to pull through the first-line recommendations in the u.s. and europe. and we continue to have good traction with the expanded label in the u.s., which, as you know, includes five out of six patients with heart failure.
in china, we renewed our nrdl listing for heart failure, and we are thrilled that hypertension is now listed. the dip that you see in the ex u.s. sales column is for china, and that is because of the wholesaler compensation for stock given our new price. but again, this is on the back of very good news.
now that we have the listing, we also have access to a much broader population. and if you think about the fact that only 15% of patients in china -- or hypertensive patients in china are well controlled versus, for example, 52% in the u.s., you can start to see the potential. for 2022, we are absolutely confident we can maintain entresto's momentum in the u.s., in europe, driving broader and earlier adoption, but we're also very excited about our opportunities in asia. if i move on to slide 28.
we're now in our third year in the marketplace with zolgensma, and we've treated 1,800 babies. because this is a one-time therapy, you will continue to see volatility in the quarters as new markets gain access, as we add the bolus and then move on to an incident population. our focus is clear. we want to maintain a leading position in the u.s., focusing on the infant population.
we want to accelerate newborn screening. we know it's really important to treat sma as early as possible. and therefore, our plan is to double the rate of newborn screening in europe. and three, we want to continue on our plan for geographic expansion into emerging markets.
in parallel, we're progressing with our it formulation. we're laying the foundation to bring zolgensma to patients across the full sma spectrum. our steer study has just opened and just recruited its first patient. and we're also conducting a study in pretreated patients who may benefit from zolgensma's one-time treatment.
if i move on to slide 29. with kesimpta, we finished the year strong with $147 million sales in q4. we maintain a high share of voice. we now reach a critical mass with multiple sclerosis specialists.
we continue to onboard new patients, and the majority of those patients continue to be in first line, first switch. there is no question that b-cell therapy is now the gold standard in efficacy. we also know that there have been questions on safety in context of covid. and this has been a priority for us, to provide relevant answers to our customers.
with the reassuring vaccination data that we have, we are building additional confidence in kesimpta's profile and providing further important clinical differentiation in the marketplace. as we drive additional uptake in the u.s. and continue to execute on our launches across the world, you can expect us to continue to do everything to make this kesimpta story even better. moving on to slide 30.
as you know, we've received fda approval in december for leqvio, and we've been in the field for two weeks. on the system side, we are implementing our strategy. our focus right now is to support the p&t reviews and the implementation of acquisition or referral processes. we started onboarding alternative injection centers, and we continue to broaden our network.
we've also filed for a permanent j-code as we planned. on the healthcare professional side, we're educating on leqvio's clinical profile, the twice-yearly dosing, and the breadth of the label. we are really excited about the enthusiasm that we're getting from the market on the clinical aspects, but also seeing the high willingness of physicians to discuss the nonclinical support options. as was said before, the first half of the year will be about laying the foundation to drive the uptake in second half of the year and beyond, when some of the larger systems should be ready for buy and bill, and of course, when our permanent j-code should be issued.
on a separate note, we've also made significant progress with the nhs on the implementation plan and are awaiting the lift on the moratorium of all non-covid-related communication and initiatives to begin the rollout of the agreement. so in summary, on slide 31. 2021 was a strong year for pharma. i want to thank the teams for the focus, the bold thinking, and the diligence around customer obsession and market metrics to deliver exquisite execution.
you will see us continue to build on that strong foundation in 2022, with the right investments, not only in our products, but also in new partnerships, customer engagement and digital tools. so thank you very much. and now let me pass it on to susanne. 
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
thank you, marie-france. and moving to oncology on slide 33. you see that the oncology business grew 4% in 2021, reaching $15.5 billion, with our growth drivers increasing 17% versus prior year. and also q4 was a solid quarter, growing 3%.
as you see, the growth was driven by continued double-digit growth of brands like kisqali, promacta/revolade, tafinlar plus mekinist and jakavi. we are very pleased to see a continued strong portfolio rejuvenation, with these growth drivers now representing 54% of the total portfolio. moving to slide 34: kisqali. we saw a very strong performance, growth of 58% in q4, reaching now $285 million in sales.
we saw increased demand across all region as a reflection of further penetration in the first-line post-menopausal segment. we continue to gain share in the u.s., with nbrx in the metastatic setting reaching 17% in november '21. and in the international markets, we had an impressive growth of 90%, mostly driven by europe, where we sustained leadership in premenopausal setting, but also increased penetration in the largest postmenopausal setting. with the monaleesa-2 data presented at esmo, kisqali demonstrated the longest median overall survival so far in advanced breast cancer, and we now have os data across all eligible patient populations.
and this is why kisqali is also the only cdk4/6 inhibitor highlighted in the u.s. nccn guidelines to demonstrate os benefit in first line. so we are moving forward with confidence in kisqali. and in collaboration with the solti study group, we have initiated the phase 3 harmonia trial to evaluate kisqali versus palbociclib in advanced breast cancer.
in addition, we continue our geographical expansion of kisqali, with reimbursement achievement in brazil and regulatory submission in china. as you know, our key development program is the natalee trial studying kisqali in adjuvant setting for both high- and intermediate-risk patients. and this study is fully recruited. and as vas mentioned, the readout is expected toward the end of 2022.
so overall, we very pleased with the kisqali performance and expect continued momentum. on slide 35, you see three of our blockbusters: tafinlar plus mekinist, promacta or revolade, and jakavi. these brands continue to deliver double-digit growth, driven by strong demand across regions. tafinlar plus mekinist was growing 14%, with strong contribution from europe.
and just to remind ourselves, this is the first and only targeted therapy to achieve both five-year overall survival in metastatic, as well as adjuvant. and tafinlar plus mekinist continues to sustain leadership in metastatic melanoma as the most used worldwide targeted therapy in the setting. moving forward, we expect growth will primarily come from adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer indication, as well as the increased uptake in china. also, promacta/revolade reached very strong growth with 12%.
and we saw this growth across all regions with share gains supported by the sustained efficacy and oral administration convenience. and we expect continued growth in itp and saa. and finally, jakavi, reaching a 12% growth. this growth was driven by earlier usage in myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.
and we continue with our geographical expansion on graft-versus-host disease launches, and we expect further uptake there as well. so moving to slide 36. last quarter, as vas mentioned, we have launched scemblix in the u.s. and this is a unique stamp inhibitor with superior clinical profile in late line cml that could potentially change the standard of care.
and you see that scemblix has a very strong clinical profile with a twofold improvement in major molecular response and a three times reduction and discontinuation due to adverse event. so looking at the patient potential for scemblix, that views that approximately 25% to 30% of cml patients may be eligible within the approved scemblix label. and this includes patients experienced resistance or intolerance with previously treated two or more tkis, as well as patients with the t315i. and as you know, we have started a first-line registrational trial with filing expected in the first half of 2025.
so leveraging decades of experience in cml, scemblix is off to a solid start in the u.s., with leading share of voice already within the first months. and this is complemented by a robust digital footprint with over 20,000 users and nearly 60,000 patient website visits. we have over 50 patients enrolled in our patient-assisted program and have above 150 patients included in our managed access program. scemblix is also already included in the ncnn guidelines.
so we are also pursuing global commercialization, and the approvals in europe and japan remain on track for 2021. moving to slide 37. with our radioligand therapy, lutetium-psma-617, we have another exciting launch upcoming. lutetium-psma has the potential to address the high unmet need in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
and results of the phase 3 vision trial demonstrated improved radiographic pfs and overall survival. on the commercial side, we are moving forward with launch preparations. we are targeting 435 treatment sites across u.s. and europe.
we are leveraging our lutathera footprint combined with an incremental field force dedicated to prostate cancer. in the u.s., that field force is fully recruited and trained. and the same is true for europe, where we start building that field force. we don't foresee any hospital capacity constraints for the launch in this vision population.
and on the development side, we currently have two ongoing phase 3 studies in the pre-taxane in the hormone-sensitive setting, with the potential to significantly expand the eligible population by up to four times. so in conclusion, moving to slide 38. i would like to conclude with three important messages. first, in 2021, we continued to see solid execution on growth brands and portfolio rejuvenation, with sales from our growth drivers increasing 70% versus prior year.
with kisqali, one of our key brands, we continued to gain share in the cdk4/6 class and we have strong os data in metastatic setting. and we are looking forward to the natalee readout in adjuvant. and we keep our focus on launch execution with scemblix and lutetium-psma preparation and advancing our next wave of assets. and with that, i'm handing over to harry. 
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you very much, susanne. good morning and good afternoon, everybody. so i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as provide you with our 2022 guidance.
as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless i would note it otherwise. turning to slide 40. here, we compare briefly our results with our latest 2021 guidance. as you can see, overall, our full year results were in line with guidance, with a particularly strong innovative medicines performance.
innovative medicines grew the top line by 6%, and the bottom line, even double-digit by 10%. we are pleased that despite a challenging business environment during the year, we were able to deliver on our expectations. next slide, please. we finished the year on a strong quarter, with sales and core operating income growing 6% and 12%, respectively.
this resulted in full year performance of 4% and 6% growth in top and bottom line. net income of $24 billion benefited, of course, from the one-time gain from the roche stake divestment of $14.6 billion. but even if you exclude that effect, and you see that in the lower line below net income, net income grew a healthy 15%, mainly due to higher sales and productivity gains. core eps grew 7%, mainly from a strong core operating income growth, and was slightly impacted by the roche divestment in quarter 4.
free cash flow was up 14%, reaching $13.3 billion. and i will go a bit into more details about free cash flow a little later. before we move on, just wanted to highlight that quarter 4 sales growth includes a positive 1-percent-point impact from a small reclassification effect of contract manufacturing from other revenues to sales. slide 42, please.
this slide shows you the performance by division for the quarter and full year. clearly, innovative medicines had a strong year, driven by our key growth drivers, entresto, cosentyx, zolgensma, and the key oncology brands, which also marie-france and susanne laid out. the innovative medicine sales grew 6%; bottom line, 10%; and margins reaching 36.2% points, up from 32% in 2018, so an increase over the three-year period of 420 basis points. for the quarter, innovative medicines sales grew 7% and core operating income 15%.
as vas mentioned, sandoz is still facing some challenges, mainly from pricing pressures, especially in the u.s., and covid-related demand impacts. although quarter 4 showed signs of stabilization. now let's turn to slide 43. free cash flow of the year was mainly driven by the higher operating income and was up 14% to $13.3 billion.
there were also lower payments from legal matters in 2021 compared to what we had in 2020. this was offset, as you can see, by the upfront payment for in-licensing of tislelizumab from beigene. on the next slide, i'm very pleased to announce that we will propose our 25th consecutive dividend increase to chf 3.10 per share from chf 3 last year. this is an increase of 3.3% in swiss franc and 6% in u.s.
dollars, with our dividend reaching 4%. and fully aligned with our dividend policy of dividend increases every year in swiss francs. now turning to slide 45, where we sum up our guidance on top and bottom line. with the divisions, we expect another year of innovative medicine sales growing mid-single digits and core operating income to grow mid- to high single digits ahead of sales.
the expected innovative medicines core margin increase will be driven by the expected good top-line momentum and continuation of our productivity programs. for sandoz, we expect the top line to be broadly in line with prior year and core operating income to decline low to mid-single digit, mainly driven by gross margin pressures due to pricing and product mix. also on the top line, it's also due to the fact that we do not expect many launches for sandoz in 2022. with respect to the entire group, we expect both the top and the bottom line to grow mid-single digit.
the key assumption for this guidance, as you can see in the bottom box here, is that we are continuing to return to normal global healthcare systems, including prescription dynamics. and that no sandostatin lar generics would enter in the u.s. in 2022. on slide 46, i would like to add some perspective on other key financial elements of our expected core net income performance.
as you can see, we expect core net financial results to be broadly in line versus 2021. and the 2022 core tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17% to 17.5%. this is higher than the 16% core tax range -- tax rate range we experienced over the last couple of years. however, as you can see, approximately 1 percent point of this increase is due to the mathematical impact of the roche divestment.
and there may also be a slight increase due to geographical profit mix changes, which we will monitor throughout the year. finally on slide 47. for modeling purposes, we thought it would be very helpful to you to go into some details regarding the currency impact, especially given the recent appreciation of the u.s. dollar.
as you saw in quarter 4, currency had a negative impact of 2% on net sales and a negative 3-percent-point impact on core operating income. as the u.s. dollar further strengthened, this currency effect, of course, also impacted the sales of our key growth drivers ex u.s. in quarter 4.
if late january rates prevail for the remainder of 2022, we would expect the full year impact of currencies on top line to be a negative 3 percent points; and on bottom line, negative 4 percent points. in quarter 1, the impact is a bit more pronounced, and sales would be negative 4; and on bottom line, negative 5 points. as currency rates are quite volatile, as we all know, we update this impact estimate every month on our website. and with this, i will hand it over back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thank you, harry. so moving to slide 49 and briefly in closing. in '21, we delivered on our goal of mid-single -- our guidance of mid-single-digit top-line growth, margin expansion, and strong free cash flow.
we remain confident in our in-market growth drivers, six major brands that are performing well across geographies, supporting our confidence in our outlook of 4% plus sales cagr to 2026. we've continued to deliver important innovation milestones across the portfolio. and we'll work over the coming 12 to 24 months to deliver important milestones on our 20-plus key assets. and we remain balanced in our capital allocation, continuing to invest in innovation, alongside returning capital to our shareholders.
and with that, operator, we can open the line for questions. [operator instructions] thank you. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of graham parry, bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so just regarding the sandoz review. obviously, you're looking there, you're saying all options are still on the table despite there being some recent speculation, again, about there being some private equity interest.
and when you're considering a sale versus spin versus keeping the business, how much consideration are you giving to what multiple do you think the market would value sandoz at versus what an acquirer might view it at? and secondly, in the scenario of a sale, what uses of cash would you consider, given that you're already doing a large buyback? so would the intent there to be to return capital to investors? or to put it back into the business through m&a and organic investment? thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham, for the question. let me start with where we are on the process. and i think as we guided at the end of last year, the first part of this year is really focused on carving out the financials for sandoz, being clear on the perimeter, and then being able to provide potential counterparties with the relevant information for them to make concrete formal offers, whether those are private equity or other companies. alongside that, evaluate the options for a potential spin of the business, and lastly, a potential retention of the business.
we are going through the work right now of evaluating those different options. and i expect that to take us to the middle of this year. before then, we can take the next steps and hopefully come to a decision in the second half of the year. in terms of considerations.
we're of course always looking at a few things. one, how to make sandoz as successful as possible with -- consistent with the aspiration for sandoz to become the leading generics company in the world. second, what is most value-creating and also tax-efficient for our shareholders. we, i think, have proven with the alcon spin that we're able to think through those considerations in a way that is beneficial to the shareholders and really making sure we're thinking about these things in a shareholder-friendly way.
and i think it's really premature for us to speculate, if there were a ""sale,"" how we would use the cash. and i think we're still a long ways away from that point in time. and we would of course be able to determine that at that point in time. but we would stay consistent with the balanced capital allocation approach which i outlined earlier, thinking through investing in the business versus returning value to shareholders.
so thanks for the question, graham. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard parkes, bnp paribas. please go ahead. your line is open. 
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas--analyst
hi. thanks very much for taking my question. i've got a question on capital allocation. i remember on the last call, you mentioned that you were engaging with investors around the sort of balance of returning the capital from the roche stake sale between sort of buybacks and m&a.
and i just wondered how your thoughts on m&a and business development had evolved based on that feedback. i'm just wondering if more meaningful bolt-ons have moved up or down the priority list, based on that feedback. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, thank you. thank you, richard. so i think not much more to say on the feedback. i mean, what i can -- i think we can say is that we know that given the strong cash flow that we generate at novartis, we have the ability to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, like we've done in the past, when we find attractive assets that fit with our therapeutic area goals and our platform goals.
as we evaluated the situation over the course of december, it became clear that at this point in time, we could return significant capital to shareholders through the buyback, while maintaining the ability to also do attractive, accretive m&a if it should materialize. so right now, our focus is, of course, first and foremost, in driving the business and then evaluating the various options that are out there over time. but of course, being very patient to ensure we only do deals where we're confident that we can generate significant returns for the company and also fit with our strategic priorities. so i would say there's nothing imminent.
and we're going to continue to evaluate the options and watch how valuations move in the sector and then look for opportunity as they arise. we're quite happy to continue to do deals, like the four deals that we've done in quarter 4, that enabled us to acquire four mid-stage and/or late-stage assets. did some various deal structures we think at attractive financial terms. harry, anything else you want to add on that?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
no. i think one element to see, i think, also feedback on the $15 billion share buyback has been quite positive. and also, maybe some analysts and investors are not very familiar with the swiss system, where we have to buy these on the second line for cancellation. and that takes then unto the middle to the second half of next year, so '23, unlike u.s.
situations where you can do this quite quickly. so as we see then -- can monitor the market, we do as much as we can on this $15 billion share buyback as we go forward. so there's a little bit of time to continue to think about the different ways of capital allocation. and then, of course, we have to see, as vas mentioned, would there be a great opportunistic m&a opportunity here? and otherwise, as we laid out the capital allocation priorities, that's how we're going to allocate continuously our capital.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello. thanks. a question on leqvio, please. you talked a lot about the hard work you've done in removing access and reimbursement hurdles in the u.s.
but do you think you need any specific guideline inclusions or recommendations to start driving use there? and is there the possibility of sort of trying to protocolize this in any way in your centers of interest to get sales going? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, laura. marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
 yeah. so the first thing i'd say is that ldl lowering is already widespread across the guidelines, and we already have class 1a in europe. so when you asked your question, the intent philosophically of us going or concentrating on the 200 systems of care is exactly that. it's around, how do you protocolize the use or the management of lipid lowering within the system? so how that looks like concretely will probably depend system by system.
but as you know, we've just launched a cooperation with the aha, which is around -- it's not necessarily specific to leqvio, but it is around how do you better monitor and control cholesterol lowering for patients. so the intent is there, it's about making sure that we can identify the care pathways and then also support the centers in how they can specifically identify patients who come in when their ldl is not at the level that it should be or not at goal. so you're absolutely right. that's the intent.
that's the way we're looking at it. locally, it's going to look very different, country by country, system by system, but that's the goal. and ultimately, we'll change the landscape in ascvd, because today, even though there are medicines on the marketplace, patients are not being treated and they're not at goal, and therefore, you see 18 million deaths worldwide because of ascvd. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. thanks, laura. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open. 
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks. could you just outline for us the differences between this 15,000 victorion-2p and the orion-4 trial for leqvio? i'm assuming this is just a sort of marketing base phase 3 to expand clinician experience, but maybe i've missed something different about the patient populations apart from the subtleties. and maybe if you have a second, perhaps you could comment on the ligelizumab surprise, given how robust the pretty large phase 2b data was. is this that the xolair arm did better than expected? if you have any insights, it'd be great to hear.
thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, andrew. john?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. it's a question on the impact of covid, specifically to -- in three areas for you. firstly, could you give us an update on the dynamic ms market as this affects kesimpta? and also recruitment into the phase 3 remibrutinib study that started in fourth quarter. and also, for leqvio in the u.k., marie-france, you mentioned the nhs non-covid block is about to be released.
but i just wondered how the significant backlogs within the u.k. healthcare system could potentially impact the rate at which you will accrue the target number of patients over the next few years. thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon. so first, marie-france, on the ms market and leqvio, nhs.
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
 yeah. so maybe i'll just start off by saying that we're all getting used to covid. and i think not only the industry, but also healthcare systems in general, we're sort of learning to become more and more agile. but it is true that there are areas that are disproportionately impacted.
and clearly, the dynamic multiple sclerosis market, if you look at it, it is still below pre-covid levels. and we are also seeing, as you said, a delay in our leqvio launch in the u.k. given this moratorium on anything that's not covid related. so ultimately, yes, it's true.
i don't think for kesimpta, it slowed us down. i can already say, for example, that in the beginning of the year, we already have all of our patients reverified. we've tried as much as possible be out there with physicians. our share of voice is high.
we have absolutely doubled down on patient services to make sure that patients are not left out in the cold in this whole sort of pandemic era. so i do think it's almost allowed us to basically rethink some of the way that we approach the market and do better. however, it's a clear reality on certain areas, and not only those. for the u.k., as i said this morning, it hasn't really slowed us down on the implementation.
i mean, we've been working really diligently in the background on things that we would have had to do anyway, right? so nhs guidelines, making sure that the communication is ready to go out. looking at, for example, the patient digital identification. the nhs guidelines have already been written. so i think when this moratorium is lifted -- and of course, yes, remember that this is all in the primary care sector.
so our entire plan for the nhs is centered around the primary care physician, and that's where the moratorium is. so we're waiting for that to be lifted. but i do want to reassure the audience that we're not at a standstill. we're doing the things that we would have to do anyway and laying the groundwork for the future.
and with -- maybe a last word on kesimpta. we're bullish on our ability to double sales in the u.s. we've got approval in 63 countries around the world. we're working through reimbursement.
and so we believe it's going to be a good year for kesimpta despite the local, let's say, lockdowns or pandemic influence that we see across the globe. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then, john, on remibrutinib recruitment, any insights yet?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
absolutely. thanks for the question, simon. the ms space is one that we know very well from our experience in the studies that we conducted across gilenya, mayzent, as well as kesimpta. we announced earlier in the year in 2021 that we were advancing with remibrutinib, which is our selective molecule btk inhibitor, in the space.
we had discussions in the middle of the year to late in the year with regulatory authorities. and we've already started recruiting at the end of the year. and we know the space well. we're confident that we can recruit in the ms space.
and that we're excited to continue to fulfill the criteria in terms of advancing the recruitment for the ms patients for remibrutinib. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. thanks, simon. next question, operator.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of tim anderson, wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open. 
unknown speaker
yeah. it's richard wagner, wolfe research, for tim anderson. my question on m&a, whether you can say definitively that you won't do larger m&a, meaning something that would be, say, $30 billion or larger. thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
 yeah. thanks for the question, richard. we don't have plans to do ""larger m&a."" hard to sign up for specific threshold given the dynamics in the market. but our focus is not larger m&a.
our focus is bolt-on. bolt-on deals, most of the deals we've done, as i mentioned earlier, have been sub-$1 billion upfront with payouts for the total deal value of less than $2 billion, as in recent times, including the four deals that we recently signed. and we continue to focus our energies there. we look at larger assets.
valuations are stretched, expectations remain high. harder to make the numbers work to create value for shareholders and an attractive profile for novartis. but we continue to assess those, let's call, the larger bolt-on deals. and then beyond that, we are not looking at large m&a, no, at this time.
so next question, operator. thank you, richard. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg. please go ahead. your line is open.
kerry holford -- berenberg -- analyst
thanks very much. question please on sandoz. in your presentation, harry, you're speaking of stabilization in q4. but the 2022 guidance in this division is somewhat disappointing.
i wonder if you can walk us through the drivers on your guidance for operating profit decline this year. is that predominantly price pressure? more of the same? could be disruption? or is there some element of more investment required to see the top line of this division return to growth? i guess, specifically, i'm looking what you expect to get more difficult for sandoz this year since last, given this time stabilization sign you mentioned in q4. and then just a very quick follow-up. can we assume the contract manufacturing revenue reclassification you mentioned in the quarter is a one-off event?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, kerry. so maybe first on sandoz. richard, do you want to start? and then maybe harry can chime in if anything --
richard saynor -- chief executive officer of sandoz
yeah, sure. thank you, vas. and thank you for the question, kerry. yes, as i said, look, q4, we saw things returning back to a more normal state of affairs and a nice, i guess, solid performance in quarter 4.
as we go into 2022, i mean, we're seeing good growth from the rest of the world. and really, the challenge continues to be the u.s. and that's slowly -- the impact of price clearly drives the issues in the u.s., but we're slowly stabilizing. and so really i see 2022 is a year where the rate of decline in the u.s.
does stay low, but it does drag down the overall business. price still is a significant impact. and also bear in mind, 2022, we don't see many significant launches. it's still a fairly quiet year in terms of loe launches.
so really, the impact on bottom line is really a mixture of price and mix. and we expect that then to slowly start changing as we come out of '23 into '24 as the biologics pipeline starts to kick in again and the u.s. continue at its stabilize journey. and we see accelerated growth then in europe and the rest of the world. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard. and then harry, on contract manufacturing? and i don't know if you have any other comments on sandoz.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
no. i think richard said it all on sandoz. in terms, kerry, of contract manufacturing, we have reported relatively small contract manufacturing business within other revenues. and now that we may increase over the next years a little bit that business, we basically chose to change representation, split up the sales and cogs.
and we also transparently show that, actually, on page 13 of the condensed financial report, in established medicines, you see under the contract manufacturing line, $108 million in quarter 4, which is kind of the full year '21 as we decided in the year that maybe over the next few years, this may increase. so that's why we changed that. it doesn't change the full year number for the company. it changes in the quarter basically by one point on the company and the two divisions.
and so we will -- you will see that as we go forward, how this is developing. and from that standpoint, we thought it's a better representation as we go forward.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, kerry. thanks, harry. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
 hi. thank you for taking my questions, please. two if i may. first, kind of, vas, in your introductory comments, you spoke about your aspiration to be a top-three innovator.
i was wondering if you might be able to give us some more details around kind of how do you define a top-three innovator. is that in terms of number of new drugs approved? is that commercial value of the pipeline? just any -- just your thoughts around kind of how do you define that. and then secondly, as we look forward to the phase 3 study readout for iptacopan, what should be our kind of expectations around the profile for that? should we be looking at superiority? should we be looking at something else? just kind of your confidence around that and where should our expectations be for that molecule. thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, keyur. on the first one, a few measures on our minds. one is the replacement power and can we be a leader in consistent replacement power of our sales? i think replacement power and/or freshness index are valuable measures of the power of an innovation engine to replace sales within our sector and then ultimately to grow the sales of the company.
second, we're very focused on the value per nme that we are able to deliver. we over the last five years, have been the leading company in the sector in the number of nmes approved, but we'd like to be the leader in the value per nme or peak sales per nme, put in another way, that we're delivering to the market. and of course, ultimately, this all leads to long-term sales growth and our ability to have an innovation engine that can drive that sales growth where we want to consistently be. but i would say replacement power and value per nme are high measures on our mind.
in terms of the phase 3 profile of iptacopan, john? 
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
 yeah. thanks, keyur. as we look at the iptacopan and the way that we're looking at the overall profile, obviously, we're looking at the overall unmet needs of the patient. as you know, this is a factor b that is actually targeting the alternative complement pathway.
we're looking at both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis for pnh in this specific indication. also, as we think about the renal indications, we're looking at it from the standpoint of reduction in terms of proteinuria. and it could be in a couple of different ways as we know that these patients have a significant unmet need as, one, that they actually may need something more than what's the current standard of care, which is through ace inhibitors and arbs. so this could be a combination approach moving forward.
the second way of looking at this, not only in terms of unmet medical need, is also the route of administration or in terms of the convenience for the patients. as we think about the approach, many patients actually are requiring the subcu administration, which could take up to 60 minutes. and having an oral administration twice a day would be much easier in terms of the approach. and thirdly is evaluating the safety profile as we look moving forward.
and we'll find out more about the safety profile as we read out in our study. so that's the way that we're looking at iptacopan overall across the indications for pnh, as well as c3g, iga, and other renal indications.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer

thank you. your next question comes from wimal kapadia from bernstein. please go ahead. your line is open.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thanks very much for taking my questions. so i just want to touch on psma. so you have an interesting readout, psmafore, potentially late 2022.
i mean, how should we be thinking about the incremental efficacy with these current benchmarks? and then, in particular, how should we be thinking about the pre-taxane setting from a potential perspective versus the post-taxane setting? and then just tied to that, the launch of -- from the vision study. is it fair to assume lutathera trajectory is a fair benchmark? or just given prostate is a larger indication, the trajectory should look a little bit different, with more sustained growth beyond the initial ramp from saturation of clinics with capability? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, wimal. so maybe, susanne, first on the overall story with lu-psma and the launch of the vision study. and then i'll hand it to john on the specific questions on pre- and post-taxane.
susanne? susanne, are you there?
susanne schaffert -- president of novartis oncology
sorry, i was on mute. so lutetium-psma has demonstrated very strong data in the metastatic castrated-resistant prostate cancer population, as you know, with significant radiographic pfs and os. so we know in this population, there's basically no alternative and lutetium-psma has demonstrated superiority versus the standard of care. so we expect there, quite big interest.
and we have started managed access programs where we already see quite high demand. so therefore, when you ask me about the uptake, it will be probably steadily going up. we don't expect a big bolus. this is fourth-line prostate cancer patients.
but of course, incidence of prostate cancer is much higher than, for example, neuroendocrine tumors. and therefore, i think we see different dynamics in the uptake. of course, it's a smaller part, it's the last line of prostate cancer. but we expect continued growth, and not like a bolus and then stability.
it's a very different population than gep-net. and maybe just a comment before i hand over to john on the setting. i mean, the current indication that we have filed for would really in last line after androgen therapy and taxane chemotherapy. and therefore, of course, with the profile that we see on lutetium-psma, we would aim to go earlier.
and certainly, the pre-taxane setting is one of the settings that is significantly bigger than what we have filed for in the current indication. so with that, john, maybe over to you. maybe a few words on psmafore. 
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
 sure. happy to talk about psmafore. maybe to start off, just to think about prostate cancer. as we know, 80% of prostate cancer is actually express psma.
so that's a starting point in the pathophysiology. what we saw in the third line, as susanne expressed, is we saw that they had 38% improvement in overall survival and 60% in terms of radiographic progression-free survival, as well as combination of os. that is the starting point. we know that there are a number of patients that are in need of additional treatments, whether that's in the pre-taxane setting or in the first-line setting, especially given the toxicity of the taxanes and chemotherapy.
and what we know is radioligand therapy has less adverse events than compared to chemotherapy. so we've already started recruitment in the pre-taxane study, and we're hoping to read out before the end of the year for the second-line treatment. and then we're also looking at first-line treatment in terms of hormone-sensitive population. and that study is also advancing.
and we're -- in addition to those studies, we're also looking at studies in terms of patients who have not had metastases in terms of prostate cancer. so i think this is going to be a very broad program as we move forward for the lutetium-psma.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thank you, john. thank you, wimal. so we have still quite a few people in the queue.
[operator instructions] next question, operator? 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matt weston from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. my question is on ensovibep. and harry or vas, i'd be very interested to understand how you've integrated it into guidance. i can see from your slides that you've given it a $1 billion on probability of just peak sales potential.
and obviously, if you're able to achieve regulatory emergency use authorization, we could see significant bolus orders. and so i'd love to know what you've taken into account when you set guidance for 2022, too. thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, matthew, and i can take that. so we've not included ensovibep in our guidance -- any of the guidance that we've provided today. i think as we understand better, as we move through the emergency use authorization application and review process, ultimately, understand the fda's decision and then the potential contracting we would have with the u.s., as well as other interested parties around the world.
we've had discussions with a number of other governments around the world around the medicine. but i would say most of those governments have centered their view on how the fda ultimately views the eua application, if they were going to make emergency orders. so we think it's prudent right now not to include it. and then once we understand the dynamics better over the course of q1, we hope, or into q2, we would then update accordingly.
thank you, matthew. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard vosser from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
richard vosser -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so just a question on price pressure from ex u.s. governments, etc.
i mean, they've been pretty hit by covid and covid expenses. after the great financial crisis, we saw some increased pressure on drug prices. are we going to see something like that? are there any murmurings from governments on pricing pressure generally? thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
well, i can start and say as far as my discussions have gone on with various health officials in europe, not heard an increased focus or a shift in terms of the support for innovative medicines and enabling medicines that have broad access or improved access. certainly, that's a priority for president macron and his european commission president. but maybe marie-france, do you have any thoughts or insights on this?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
 yeah. i mean, i just think in general, we always have to be prepared. i mean, we do more and more have to make the case, or we see limitations on reimbursement in terms of line of therapy, etc., etc. obviously, we have a lot of experience, and we're very used to that in the european landscape.
you see a lot of tough negotiations happening in china. so i would say it's a little bit almost like the ticket to entry is making sure that the value of our products is recognized, that we're focused on value-based pricing, which i think is something that novartis has been very diligent about, and making sure that access is really top of mind on any strategy when it comes to product launch or making sure that more patients can reach products faster.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
perfect. thanks, marie-france. thank you, richard. next question, operator. 
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. please go ahead. your line is open.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. maybe i'll take one on ianalumab and the decision to progress into phase 3. i guess, question around design and timing. you've published data that look, i would say, better in patients with less advanced disease.
so have you reached a decision yet about the phase 3 design? at what breadth of enrollment is that likely to include in terms of the patient population? and therefore, what proportion of the sjogren's population, which is pretty large, that might -- that phase 3 trial might apply to? and then just in terms of timing, you, i think, told us at the r&d day, 2026 was the likely timing for a potential phase 3 readout. is there any way that could be accelerated, for example, an interim surrogate or biomarker data? since that would imply a pretty long phase 3 time line. thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, emmanuel. very good questions. john, on ianalumab phase 3 design for sjogren's?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah. as we think about ianalumab, and as vas said earlier, we're excited about a number of indications in sjogren's syndrome, lupus nephritis, and sle. specifically, as you asked about sjogren's syndrome, as you know, we've advanced based on results that we've seen from our phase 2 study. these are patients who actually have had high sti scores.
and that's the specific population that we're targeting, moving forward in this population. we are going to start recruiting patients in the second half of this year. in terms of advancing, i think the balance here is the largest sjogren's syndrome phase 3 study that's been conducted -- actually, i should say, the largest study, not phase 3, but the largest study that's been conducted has been conducted by us. and we want to ensure that there is consistency in terms of these patients that we're recruiting because sjogren's is a very diverse population of patients.
we've guided the results in 2026, and we will update as we find the patients and how recruitment goes. but we are using strict criteria for inclusion to ensure that we get the best results moving forward. currently, we are expecting results in '26.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i mean, i think one of the dynamics i've learned is how important it is to have well-trained centers here that really ensure that they apply the sti and some of the other measures in a consistent way. so i think we want to be appropriately cautious on our time line. and then, of course, as we learn more, as john said, we'll provide updates on ianalumab across all of the indications that we take it forward in. thanks, emmanuel.
next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. entresto china, can you help us understand the size of the opportunity in hypertension? but when the loe timing is going to kick in? and on the basis of that, the pivot opportunity within the retail pharmacy setting to maintain your momentum in china? and then just quickly, vas, in terms of clarification. in terms of the sandoz considerations for counterparties, what should we expect next in terms of biosimilar data? and what are the key loe launches coming up in '23 and beyond?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely, mark. so first, on the entresto china, marie-france?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
yeah. so the opportunity, certainly from a volume perspective, is significant, right? so we're moving the population from 7 million to 8 million heart failure patients to about 240 hypertension patients. and as i said before in my comments, hypertensive patients in china are really not well controlled. so there is a big opportunity.
obviously, there was a significant price concession as we listed nrdl. but we do think that it is a worthwhile proposition just because there's an opportunity to just expand to such a broad, broad population of patients. so we are -- we have broadened our footprint as well. we're making the necessary investments.
we also want to make sure that we have the right digital tools in place. as you know, we have a cooperation with tencent where we're looking, of course, entresto-independent, but looking at making sure that heart failure patients can be more in control of their own monitoring. so there are a lot of activities in this space. as you know, in china, cvd is a major -- cardiovascular disease is a major problem with massive costs.
and when it comes to the patent situation in china, china is hard to give a definitive answer. we are obviously working to secure rdp in china, and i think that's an industrywide initiative. so there are some question marks around until when. and it certainly -- couldn't give you guidance on that here today.
but the opportunity is significant. we're thrilled about it. this was, as we said, a potential upside for us, and could be up to about a third of our, let's say, growth in entresto for this year. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. and then on sandoz biosimilars upcoming launches, richard?
richard saynor -- chief executive officer of sandoz
thanks, vas. really, the next launches are really adalimumab and natalizumab coming in, i guess, late '23, into '24. so as i think i commented earlier that that's really the start of the next wave of biosimilars that should start accelerating both our top line and clearly the margin expansion for the business. and clearly, we'll update as we file and move those products forward.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark. thanks, richard. thank you, mark. i think we have time for -- i don't know how many more we have in the queue.
but operator, let's take the next question, and we'll keep going till the mid of the hour.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of florent cespedes from societe generale. please go ahead. your line is open.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks very much for taking my question. a quick follow-up on china, please. could you please elaborate on, beyond entresto, which are the growth drivers there and potential risk? and how you see the momentum in china? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
marie-france, do you want to take that on pharma china?
marie-france tschudin -- president of novartis pharmaceuticals
 yeah. so we've got three main growth drivers for the pharma business in china: cosentyx, entresto, and lucentis. and all three products are showing strong growth. i mean, as we mentioned before, they were all affected in q4.
but q4 is also normally the lowest quarter in the year for us. so we talked about the budget constraints for cosentyx. we've seen the rebound in q1 for entresto, the nrdl listing, and the stock compensation. and lucentis was due to covid lockdowns.
but the one thing i'll say about china is that, going forward and giving the fact that the country is now so open to innovation, we are now thinking about china as we think about any other country. so when we look forward at our portfolio, whether that's leqvio, we just received the launch of -- or the approval for kesimpta, we are thinking about our portfolio in china in the same way as we're thinking about our portfolio in the u.s. and europe. so going forward, that's what you can expect, the three growth drivers, maybe the big exception is lucentis, which continues to be a strong growth driver for us in china.
and that's where the focus is, that's where we're investing and that's where our footprint is working.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, marie-france. so next, we'll go to -- i think we have two more first-time questions. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from peter welford from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing me in. one for harry, really, the outlook for innovative medicines, the outlook for the core operating income, mid- to high single digits is sort of slightly above sales growth. obviously, this year, you started similar, but you delivered close to 10%.
wondered if you could talk a little bit about what we should be thinking about the greater investments, i guess, you're making this year, which, if you like, constrained perhaps the margin expansion versus the benefit we saw in '21, the result in that mid- to high single-digit growth. or is it just conservatism on your part? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, peter. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, peter. so of course, always a fine balance, right? as we know, in pharma companies, one can get almost any kind of core margin one would like to have. but it's always this very delicate balance between investing and also driving, of course, productivity as we do.
and so overall, we have made significant strides on the core margin improvement. as vas shared in one of his earlier charts, the 180 basis point in '19, 220 basis point in '20, and then 130 basis point last year. and a part of that was also some restricted investments, if you will, due to the pandemic situation. so we always ensure that we invest appropriately in the r&d line, certainly.
and we have to ensure that the launches are getting very well supported. and we have fantastic launches that marie-france, susanne, and her teams -- and their teams are driving. so i would expect each of the next years in innovative medicines, some good margin improvement, but of course, not to the level we have seen over the last two, three years. so it's a balance and the investments are clearly in the pipeline and the launches.
thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and then we have time -- thanks, peter. last question, operator?
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. your last question today comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim. please go ahead. your line is open.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
great. thanks for the questions. so just wanted a couple of pipeline questions very quickly. just in terms of the differentiation, what makes ianalumab unique from other apo or baff compounds that have failed in similar type indications, particularly in lupus? i think we've seen a number of challenges there.
and then just separately, on ligelizumab versus remibrutinib in csu, can you just help us understand the decision points as it relates to ligelizumab for filing? and then how, if you do launch there, you'll trade off your expectations for remibrutinib in a similar setting? thanks. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, john, are you still there? do you want to take the ianalumab?
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
sure. absolutely. and thanks for the question, seamus. as we look at ianalumab, this is our anti-baff agent.
and we really see two different modes of action with ianalumab. it's a direct lysis of b cells by adcc as one path, and the other is baff receptor blockade that interrupts the baff-mediated signaling for b-cell maturation, proliferation, and survival. so the difference here is there are dual modes of mechanisms of action versus what has been seen with previous baff receptor blockers. and what we've seen is actually this counterbalance of the two mechanisms that allows us to see -- and we've actually seen good responses, as we said earlier, in our phase 2 studies, and that's why we're moving forward in these various indications.
on your second question in terms of -- go ahead. go ahead, vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i think -- i was just going to chime in on -- i think some of the competitor of historical molecules only targeted the baff ligand, and then only in certain subtypes of the baff ligand, so not completely comparable to previous results. go ahead, john, on remibrutinib. 
john tsai -- head of global drug development and chief medical officer
yeah. so in terms of looking at remibrutinib versus ligelizumab. as we look at both combinations, we've seen good results in both. and as you know, for remibrutinib, for the btk-selective oral inhibitor, what we've seen is also good results in csu with an oral compound.
so as we're moving forward, we're looking at both approaches, and we'll make decisions as we further analyze the results from ligelizumab. and then as we move forward with remibrutinib, we'll continue recruitment in these studies.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i think, seamus, the idea of ligelizumab, i guess the question, is there value in getting the medicine on the market ahead of the potential future launches in food allergy and cindu? or is that not a sensible strategic approach? and we just haven't come to a determination yet. our current view is that we -- with the superiority to placebo, it is potentially fileable. and of course, we'll review it with the fda. so we're going to make those assessments carefully and then decide what the right approach is to take ahead.
very good. so thanks, everyone, for joining today's conference call. we hope it was helpful to get a perspective on both the near term, but also the longer-term outlook of the company, the pipeline, the products, and the things we're excited about. we're excited about delivering a strong 2022.
and we'll look forward to keeping you up to date through various interactions, and then of course in our next quarterly conference call. we wish you a great year, and we'll look forward to speaking to you soon. thank you.

2022-Q1,NVS,2022-04-26 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q1 2022 results release conference call and live webcast. [operator instructions] with that, i would like to hand over to mr. samir shah, global head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much, everybody. and good morning, and good afternoon to all participants. thank you for joining us today for novartis' quarter 1 2022 results. before we start, just wanted to go through the safe harbor statements.
the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. these may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f and its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that, respectively, were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission.
and with that, i'll hand the call to vas. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir, and thanks, everyone, for joining our conference call today. if we could move forward a few slides. so, with me today, i have harry kirsch, our chief financial officer; and karen hale, our chief legal officer. if we go to slide 4, overall, the quarter came out with a solid start for novartis across all of our four key pillars.
from a growth standpoint, good sales growth, both at the im and sandoz and, of course, the overall group level, good productivity. group core operating income up 9% on a constant currency basis, as well as a solid result in both im and sandoz. some important innovation milestones, i'll go through those in a bit more detail. and we also continue to advance our esg agenda in amr, as well as access to medicines agreements in africa.
so, i think a solid quarter that we can build on over the course of this year. moving to the next slide. our innovative medicines sales grew across both our u.s. and ex-u.s.
geographies, 3% in the u.s., 5% ex-u.s. in constant currencies, with growth drivers now accounting for 56% of our im sales growth of -- the growth drivers up 21% quarter over quarter. so, a nice demonstration that we continue to replace our sales base with newer and newer products. now, moving to slide 6, we saw strong performance on our key growth drivers, the six brands we've been consistently highlighting.
and i'll talk about them in a bit more detail. but you can see, really, across these key brands, growth that ranged from the high single-digit to the double-digit range. so, again, pleased with the broad-based performance. of course, there were pockets of weakness, and we could talk more about that.
but overall, we're pleased that we're off to this solid start on the key brands. but let's go a bit deeper on the six key brands. moving to the next slide, on slide 7, you see that on cosentyx, entresto, zolgensma, kisqali, kesimpta, and leqvio, we had good growth on the major brands that we really believe will drive our midterm sales performance and, of course, continue to maintain our peak sales guidance on these brands. importantly, as well, kesimpta has now demonstrated in q1 the potential we expect of this brand to really reach that multibillion-dollar potential with very strong growth in the quarter.
we'll talk more about that. and with leqvio, we continue to build a solid foundation base for what will be a multi-year journey to get to the multibillion-dollar sales potential. but i think the initial foundational elements are starting to come into play. so, again, it will be a longer-term journey for this brand.
moving to slide 8. and going to each one of these brands brand by brand, first, with respect to cosentyx, double-digit sales growth, 12% on the quarter, really, driven by our ex-u.s. performance. and when you look at the specifics on the growth momentum, we saw steady volume growth in the u.s.
and e.u. we have 700,000 patients now across our five indications treated worldwide since launch. very good performance in rheumatology across geographies. we expect double-digit growth in '22 driven by our china market expansion.
year to date, our china performance has been good. we also will, in the medium term, be driven by our ability to get new indications online. we are on track for our hidradenitis suppurativa submission this year. and we do expect the chmp decision on a couple of additional indications later in quarter 2.
so, we confirm our $7 billion-plus peak sales expectations of cosentyx. moving to the next slide. entresto had an outstanding first quarter, growing 42% on the quarter, driven by both u.s. and ex-u.s.
performance. you can see here the u.s. weekly nbrx showing a nice steep ramp as we come out, particularly, as we come out of the pandemic period. this growth has been driven across hospitals, cardiology, and primary care.
so, really broad-based in the u.s., primarily driven by reduced ejection fraction, especially with the new guidelines that are now in place, but also supported by the preserved ejection fraction indication. we have strong demand growth in europe for the brand and in china, as well as japan. the launch of our hypertension indications and the nrdl listing in china have helped drive this growth. so, longer term, we expect the continued development of evidence-based, the continued drive of the guidelines that placed arni as the first choice for physicians treating reduced ejection fraction heart failure, as well as for further penetration in china and japan to drive the momentum for entresto.
moving to the next slide. zolgensma grew 18% on the quarter with increasing access outside of the united states. the q1 highlights were really the ex-u.s., where we had sales growth, 32% in constant currency, while the u.s. remained steady as we continue to drive up the newborn screening rates.
so, right now, we have over 2,000 patients treated worldwide, which, i think, demonstrates the profile of this gene therapy and the confidence providers are having in using this medicine. in the future, our growth will be driven by continuing to penetrate in the u.s. and the under two, really getting to a high market share. we expect to have over 90% of children who are diagnosed in newborn screening receiving zolgensma, that's our goal, and continuing to drive up that newborn screening in the e.u.
above 25%. our next phase of data studies -- or data generation is on track with steer study with intrathecal in older children. it's currently enrolling the strength study to further profile, and the iv setting is starting in the second half. we also rolled out some additional data at mda, which supports the overall profile of zolgensma iv.
so, this will be a steady ramp toward our goal to be -- toward a $2 billion product over time. but overall, the signs and signals are good. moving to the next slide. kisqali demonstrated -- delivered 28% growth on the quarter, primarily driven again by ex-u.s.
performance. the market trends show a recovery to pre-covid levels for cdk4/6 trx, but we continue to see suppression in the nbrx part of the market. and so, we'll have to continue to watch to see that recovery, which will be critical for us because a lot of our growth is dependent on new-to-brand patients. kisqali's growth in the u.s.
is in line with market. but in europe, we continue to grow ahead of market. and i'll speak more about the natalee adjuvant study update that we've provided today in an upcoming slide. moving to slide 12.
now, turning to kesimpta. kesimpta, really, i think had a strong quarter. we have 20,000 patients treated. over 60% are naive or first switch.
in the u.s., we see really strong growth dynamics despite a suppressed market. you can see in the upper left-hand side of the slide, the u.s. ms growth remains below its pre-covid levels. but nonetheless, we see kesimpta continuing to gain momentum.
and now, outside of the united states, we're approved in 68 countries. so, over the course of this year and really starting in 2023, we would expect the ex-u.s. contributions to the brand to start to increase. we again rolled out additional data in the quarter, now at four years out, showing the ability to reduce disability worsening with stable igg levels, as well as data that supports the use of kesimpta in patients who need to be treated with covid-19 vaccination.
so, overall, i think a strong start to the quarter, a lot of good momentum with kesimpta, and we'll look forward to delivering that momentum -- or accelerating that momentum over the course of the year. now, moving to the next slide, slide 13. turning to leqvio, again, early days, particularly in the u.s. but i think the leading indicators points to the foundations being put in place to have this brand become a very significant brand for the company.
we reached over 90% of hcps. we have good unaided brand awareness. our dtc is now initiated. we've also established access in over -- it's actually over 50 now 200 -- of the 200 prioritized systems.
it says 35 on the slide, but we're up to 50, have ordered leqvio. our focus very much is in driving more depth in those accounts. we have 55% of our alternative injection sites accounts now have purchased leqvio, 30% repeat orders. and importantly, our permanent j-code has been granted and will go into effect on july 1.
so, all of this to say that the foundations are in place for the second half -- in the second half of this year to begin to see some more acceleration and growth for leqvio, going into what we expect to see further acceleration in the coming years. now, moving to the next slide. i just wanted to say a word on our two recent launches in the u.s. scemblix, our bcr-abl inhibitor, stamp inhibitor showed nice performance in the quarter in the third-line setting.
here, you can see our nbrx share has reached 20% through february. still small numbers, but i think it points to the potential of this medicine, given its strong efficacy and safety profile. we're up to 49% third-line patient share. and our first-line phase 3 study is now enrolling ahead of plan.
so, we remain optimistic that we can deliver an over $500 million brand in the third-line setting, but our focus in the longer term is hopefully with positive data move into the frontline setting. moving to the next slide with pluvicto. so, we, at the -- toward the end of the quarter, received approval for pluvicto. and i think on the u.s.
launch, we're off to a good start and getting again the key elements in place to really drive this launch. as a reminder, the population is metastatic crpc patients who are post relevant chemotherapies. patient selection is driven by a gallium psma-11 agent to identify patients who would benefit from pluvicto. there was a 38% reduction in the risk of death in these patients.
so, a lot of physician and kol interest in the medicine in the prostate cancer space. six infusions, six week -- over six weeks, which really gives the opportunity for a one-time therapy over that period of time and then patients derive the benefit. we're building on our lutathera experience with this medicine. our commercial field teams are in place.
we see high awareness already in the 240 treatment centers that we're targeting initially. forty rlt centers are already onboarded into the ordering system. and many of these centers have experience with us. and we have submitted the application for the permanent a-code for this medicine.
now, in europe, we expect approval in the second half of '22. and we also are progressing on track with our phase 3 studies in the pre-taxane and hormone-sensitive setting, and we're also -- which would expand the patient population 3x to 4x and allow us to target a patient population to enable this to be a multibillion-dollar brand over time. and we're evaluating additional phase 3 studies in the earlier-line setting. now, moving to the next slide.
wanted to say a word on sandoz. our business dynamics in sandoz, as you saw in the quarter, have really stabilized. we are benefiting from a lower prior-year comparison. nonetheless, it is a positive time to see now stabilizing sandoz business with good growth, 8% overall.
it was driven by performance in europe at 9%. so, we do see now moving toward the bottoming out of the u.s. business, as we look to get that region back to growth. very good biopharma performance and retail performance.
core operating income was up quite significantly, but, again, benefiting from both prior-year comps, as well as certain one-timers. and so, overall, given the geographical uncertainties, price erosion, and other inflationary pressure in sandoz spaces, we're maintaining our guidance for sandoz on the full year. but we'll, of course, continue to monitor to see how sandoz performs. just as a reminder, we continue to view sandoz as having the potential to be the leading generics company in the world, driven by its biosimilars' presence and strength, as well as key success factors which we reviewed on the previous call.
overall, our strategic review remains on track, and we would plan to provide an update on the strategic review at the latest by the end of this year. so, moving to the next slide. in terms of the pipeline, some important milestones, but i'll really dive in on just a handful. pluvicto was our key approval in the quarter, then we had some other approvals around the world, as you can see here.
in terms of submissions, we are continuing to move forward with tislelizumab in the e.u. and our filing is on track in the u.s. as well. i'll go through in a little bit more detail, our jdq data on the subsequent slide.
we continue to see good interest in iptacopan around the world as we head toward our first phase 3 readout in the second half of this year. and we're on track. we've already started our t-charge phase 2 study in multiple myeloma, and plan to start in phase 3 in dlbcl in the second half of the year. and i've already mentioned the phase 3 start of zolgensma.
so, let's move for a moment to jdq. so, at aacr, on the next slide, so we showed early signs of clinical activity with acceptable safety and tolerability for this kras g12c. as a reminder, we have a unique structure to this medicine versus the other g12c inhibitors, which we believe allows us to optimize the pk/pd for the medicine. when you look at the data set, we demonstrated a competitive safety and efficacy profile, though, again, with a caveat that this is a small study, 57% orr at the target dose of 200 milligrams bid.
no grade 3 or higher treatment-related aes, so really nice safety profile. when we look at the modeling of the overall pk of this medicine, high systemic exposure, high target level occupancy. so, we're pleased with how the medicine has performed thus far. so, we're moving forward rapidly in recruiting our combination study with shp2, as well as another separate study with anti-pd1.
and so, both the studies are moving forward. and we're also preparing to start our monotherapy phase 3 program in small cell lung cancer versus chemotherapy, which we plan to open shortly. now, moving to the next slide, we also wanted to provide an update on natalee. so, based on our regular update of the number of events that we are accruing, we now forecast the trial to complete in 2023 as the current event rate is lower than our originally forecasted event rate for the study.
this is a regular process we go through. and now, when we look at these forecast versus -- or look at our actuals versus our forecast, we're currently predicting a 2023 completion of the study. on the left-hand side, you see the study design remains unchanged from our previous update, 5,000 patients randomized 1-to-1 to ribociclib plus estrogen therapy versus estrogen therapy alone. patients receive kisqali 400 milligrams per day for 36 months.
so, a longer treatment duration, a lower dose than the metastatic setting to really try to ensure we keep patients on therapy and keep them on therapy longer to drive the efficacy signal. so, in terms of the recruitment, we completed 5,000 patients in april 2021. our primarily analysis is that 500 events. we have -- approximately 300 events to date.
in the quarter, we successfully completed a futility analysis. we have two interim analyses planned between now and the end of the study, but neither has occurred yet. and the discontinuation rate remains low in the single-digit percentages, which, i think, demonstrates the overall profile in terms of safety and tolerability of the medicine. so, all on track.
we'll continue to keep you updated as we progress this important study. as a reminder, the opportunity here is significant. we estimate in 2027 that the market for -- in the adjuvant setting could be $7 billion. and the ability to target both the intermediate and the severe patients is significant in that we estimate there are three times as many patients in the intermediate-risk versus the high-risk patient population.
so, this would offer us, if successful, a significant medicine for the company. moving to the next slide. so, our overall events are on track. i won't go through the slide in detail.
we'll continue to keep you updated as we progress on these events across our regulatory decision, submission, study readouts, and study starts. so moving to the next slide. with that, i'll hand the mic over to harry. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, vas. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials of the first quarter.
and as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless otherwise noted. so, on the next slide, we present our results for the quarter. overall, as vas mentioned, we delivered solid sales and profit growth. i think it's also important to keep in mind that this quarter's results with prior-year comparisons are affected by the divestment of our roche investment and the corresponding loss of income from associated companies, which you see here in the lines below operating income.
to aid the comparisons, we have published a reconciliation of our 2021 results, excluding those impacts on our website. and we have also shown here the growth excluding prior-year roche investment income. in quarter 1, sales and core operating income grew 5% and 9%, respectively, now with the sales benefiting from the strong performance of our in-market brands and core operating income driven by higher sales and increased productivity. net income grew 15%, mainly driven by higher core operating income and core eps grew 2%.
however, as you can see, if we exclude the impact of the prior-year roche income, net income would have grown 32% and core eps, 12%. of course, we expect these impacts on eps and core eps to be offset over time by our ongoing $15 billion share buyback program, which we expect to conclude in the second half of 2023. free cash flow was negatively impacted by 0.5 billion due to the loss of gross annual dividend share paid out last year in march. however, important to note, underlying free cash flow is in line with expectations.
and operationally, we are on track to reach our full year free cash flow objectives. in summary, it has been a solid start to the year with the strength of our in-market growth drivers, [inaudible] entresto, kesimpta, cosentyx, zolgensma, and kisqali, and our new launches, including leqvio and pluvicto, reinforcing our confidence in our midterm growth expectations. as you can see on the next slide, innovative medicines sales grew 4%, benefiting from the strong performance of the in-market brands, partly offset by generic erosion, especially in the oncology portfolio. innovative medicines bottom line grew 5%.
and core margin reached 35.9%, up slightly from the prior year in constant currencies. sandoz numbers benefited this year due to a significantly lower prior-year base, with business dynamics continuing to return to normal, with net sales up 8% and core operating income up 20%. and the margin is improving 330 basis points to 22.8% of sales. overall, the group core margin increased by 111 basis points to 32.6%, mainly driven by sandoz's performance for the quarter.
turning now to our guidance slide on slide 24. we are confirming our guidance for the full year. and as a reminder, within the divisions, we expect another year of innovative medicines sales growing mid single digit and core operating income to grow mid to high single digit ahead of sales. the expected innovative medicines core margin increase will be driven by good top-line momentum and continuation of productivity programs, including the recently announced new organizational structure.
these drivers are expected to more than offset the anticipated higher energy cost and inflation pressures in our supply chain. and for sandoz, it's important to note that the very low quarter 1 prior year base, with a weak cough and cold season due to covid and the uncertainty related to currency political -- current geopolitical events. therefore, we continue to expect the top line to be broadly in line with the prior year and core operating income to decline low to mid single digit. of course, we will be monitoring during quarter 2 and given the strong quarter 1 performance to see if we can give an update here.
but for now, given that the geopolitical events are likely to hit a bit harder sandoz, if you will, we remain cautious here. this will be mainly driven by the expected gross margin pressures because also of pricing and inflation coming in. and of course, we will have a clearer picture later in the year. for the group, we expect both the top and the bottom line to grow mid single digit.
the key assumption for this guidance is that we see continued return to normal global healthcare systems, including prescribing dynamics and that no sandoz lar generics enter in the u.s. in 2022. and then finally, on slide 25, given the strengthening u.s. dollar and as currencies are constantly changing, i want to bring to your attention the estimated currency impact on our results using current exchange rates.
in quarter 1, currency had a negative 4% point impact on net sales and a negative 6% point impact on core operating income. looking forward, if late april rates prevail for the remainder of 2022, we expect the full year impact of currencies on top line to be a negative 4% points and on bottom line, a negative 5% points. in quarter two, the impact on sales would be negative 5% to negative 6% points, and on bottom line, negative 6% points. and as a reminder, we update these currency impact estimates monthly on our website.
and with that, i hand it back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. so, if we go to slide 27. also today, we announced the appointment of ronny gal, as our chief strategy and growth officer. as a reminder, we created the strategy and growth function to enable us to combine corporate strategy, r&d portfolio management, and external business development into a single unit to help us drive the near, mid, and long-term growth of the company.
so, ronny will report to me, as he sits on the executive committee. he brings over 20 years of life sciences experience, both on the analytical side of things but also deep understanding of the science in the u.s. commercial environment, previously worked at management consulting, as well as business development. so, very excited to welcome ronny to the team no later than august 1st of this year.
so, moving to the last slide, six key priorities we outlined in january, and they remain on track, successfully launching our key -- driving our key launches like leqvio, kesimpta, pluvicto, and scemblix; maintaining the growth momentum across our six key growth drivers; progressing our pipeline of over 20 potential significant assets that had the potential to be approved by 2026; optimizing our portfolio with our sandoz review on track, but also remaining disciplined on m&a and business development; delivering returns and so the recent reorganization with a potential of billion-dollar-plus productivity that we're committing to has been announced, and we'll continue to work through that over the course of this year; and of course, maintaining the foundations of culture, data science, and esg. so, with that, i'll close and open the line for questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] sorry.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
sorry. one note, i forgot to mention. please limit yourself to one question, and we'll try to do multiple rounds if we have time. thank you.
operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of graham parry from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so, it's a follow-up on natalee. the original trial design, i think, only had two interim.
so, one was futility at 40% of events. and then there was a stop for outstanding efficacy at 70% of events. and i think the total event number you're looking for there was just over 300. but -- so, you're highlighting now that you have two efficacy interims, as well as the futility that's already passed.
so, can you just help us understand the trial design. so, what percentage of events was that futility analysis performed at? and then, at what percentage of events are the two upcoming efficacy analyses? and just to confirm, those have the potential with the stop for efficacy in them. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, graham. so, as you know, we amended the study protocol and increased 500 events along the way. and with that, we added -- we updated as well the various readouts.
so, the -- i don't have in front of me the readout for the futility endpoint. but i can say that our interim analysis for efficacy are at the 70% and 85% information fractions. so, that's when we would expect to have those interim analyses. but of course, it's difficult to predict based on an event-driven study as to when exactly those would occur.
and so, we'll continue to keep you up to date. and as a reminder, we don't guide to specific timelines on interim analyses, and we'll only provide updates if material information is provided by the dmc. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thank you very much for taking my question. it's a broader question on multiple sclerosis. it was flagged up on a call yesterday that traditionally, russia and ukraine is disproportionately involved in ms studies. since you have, i think, about 30 ongoing ms trials around the order, i just wonder if you could give us an update on the current situation.
any potential exposure you have to trials in russia and ukraine? and any effect that could have on trial timelines? thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, simon. so, overall, again, we feel like our trials are manageable in russia and the ukraine. we are in the single-digit percentages in terms of the percentage of russia and ukraine patients in our global studies.
now, specifically, in multiple sclerosis, we're in the roughly low to midteens on the studies in terms of the percent of the global patients for our btk inhibitor multiple sclerosis studies. but we already have plans in place to offset those. and so, at the moment, we believe we can fully mitigate the patients required from those two countries. no patients in our multiple sclerosis btk study or lou studies were -- have been enrolled so far.
and so, we'll simply reallocate to other markets, and we expect to remain on track. we'll, of course, keep you updated if anything were to change in that regard. next question, operator?
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matthew weston from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. it's another russian question, one for harry, please. the annual report for last year shows that you have just under $0.5 billion of russian ruble receivables. i'd be interested to understand, how is cash collection today? are you limiting deliveries to only people who pay you upfront? and then how should we think about impairment testing on that quite sizable amount of money? and then finally, harry, if you were to have to write some down, would it go through core, or would it not?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, matthew. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, matthew, overall, our cash collections and shipments actually are very normal. cash collections are very good, actually. now, over the past years and, in this role, almost over nine years, we always had here or there, you know, some difficulties with the wholesaler and then we put these wholesaler in question on a payment plan or potentially prepayment plan.
but that's not the case yet with any of them. of course, we monitor on a daily basis. and the receivables are in ruble. you have seen also ruble returning back, if you will, to its strengths.
and we have not seen difficulties to pay. now, in terms of impairments, we would have to see, but i don't expect actually impairments on it. we are highly insured. a significant part of these are insured.
and from that standpoint, we carefully monitor. we are insured, and we don't see issues yet. again, we monitor. should that change, we would inform you.
but i see a very stable product flow and a very stable cash collection.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
many thanks. perfect.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and just one update to graham's first question. the futility analysis was done at a 40% information fraction. i would also note, it does take us a couple of months between a lot for one of these to actually have the dmc read the data.
so, next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein. please go ahead. your line is open.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
oh, great. thanks very much for taking my question. so, can i just please ask about kesimpta life cycle management. so, i appreciate you're still early -- in the early stages for the products.
but, you know, one of your key competitors has started a six-month subcu trial earlier this year, and they also have a high-dose trial ongoing. so, do you have any plans to extend the dosing frequency and/or change the dose for kesimpta in an attempt to really ensure durable share gains? i appreciate it's a bit further down the line, but just curious to hear your thoughts.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, wimal. so, first, i think the key benefit of kesimpta is that the patient doesn't have to go into the center and have to deal with pretreatment with steroids and additional observation. so, our understanding of competitor life cycle management activities would still involve the patient ultimately coming into the center and of course then going into the various elements involved with that.
so, our focus remains on providing that flexibility for patients. we find it to be a key value driver, both to outstanding safety excellent efficacy, but also monthly at-home administration in terms of total time in the patient's lives. it's significantly -- significantly lower. we are evaluating various life cycle management activities.
but at this point in time, we haven't actually instigated, you know, i guess, any new studies. we'll continue to evaluate, and we'll keep you posted.
wimal kapadia -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
next. next, operator -- question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. unusually, across the industry, novartis has built and is building a large cardiovascular presence. i'm just curious whether you see any role for a factor xi inhibitor within that space. there's at least a couple of partnered agents of [inaudible], which i can barely pronounce, but you're familiar with given it came from your own portfolio.
and then second, potentially partnering with bayer on their factor xi. i wonder if you had any comments.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, andrew. so, in terms of factor xi, we developed a very attractive factor xi agent that we ultimately determined at the end of phase 2 that it would be better to move forward in other people's hands. so, we struck a partnership with blackstone life sciences.
they have taken the medicine forward and continue to develop it. so, we continue to monitor the progress of the medicine. at the moment, our view is that the focus we have on heart failure and on the various contributors to ascvd between, of course, pcsk9, lp(a), as well as other factors. it's enough at the moment to take on.
but we certainly are monitoring the space with a keen eye to what is the size of studies and the amount of investment that will be required to differentiate on safety, given that noacs will ultimately go generic in the coming years, and that will be the standard that we'd have to go up against. but we'll keep you posted if anything were to change. thank you. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard vosser from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
richard vosser -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. just looking at the oncology franchise in general, there seems to be a number of destockings in q1. so, should we anticipate this to reverse in q2? and also, should we think for the rest of the year about an acceleration as diagnosis improves as we come out of the pandemic? just thoughts on the overall franchise there.
thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. in quarter 1, we saw a few dynamics. one, we continue to see in certain cancers that we have a focus in, such as breast cancer, lower diagnosis rates than pre-covid levels, and lower nbrx, as i mentioned, with kisqali.
you know, that combined is we also did see destocking and impacts on some of our, let's call it, more mature brands and mature promoted brands, as well as off-patent brands. at the moment, we do expect the trend to stabilize and we expect in the remainder of the year the performance in oncology to be driven by our newer medicines, of course, kisqali, as well as pluvicto, scemblix, etc. but of course, continued performance from promacta, revolade, and jakavi. and so, i think we'll have to monitor it closely.
but we're optimistic that things will start to get back to normal over the course of q2. next question, operator? thanks, richard.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank. please go ahead. your line is open.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. perhaps one on jdq. congratulations on the impressive aacr update. just curious in your strategy to differentiate or catch up there given you're a little late behind the leaders in that space.
i'm particularly interested on the latest perspective as regard to the shp2 combination. i see you started an internal combination program. does that signal deprioritization of the multi-collaboration? and when indeed might we see an update of the -- clinical update of the combination days from either remote study or indeed your own internal efforts? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, emmanuel. one of the things we've observed thus far in very early clinical data is in order to have a good combination agent, we need a pretty clean profile from the g12c agents. so, one of the advantages we hope we will have, is given the absence of grade 3-4 aes in our studies, that it is a kind of combination agent of choice, so that despite us being late, we would have the opportunity to combine the medicine with other attractive agents.
ïwith our shp2, i think that's part of the story. we do have studies ongoing with mirati and amgen, but we believe our jdq molecule is optimized for combination with our shp2 to really allow us to get to the optimal dosing with, you know, limited aes and hopefully maximize the benefit for patients in our studies. so, the key to our strategy is having a medicine that can be the combination agent of choice from a g12c standpoint and then hopefully demonstrate, despite us being late in mono, that we'll be able to win the battle in the long run with combinations, pd1, shp2, and perhaps others. it's important to note, we still need to do larger studies.
i don't want us to overextend our interpretation of a relatively small clinical study, but at least the early signals are promising. thank you, emmanuel. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of emily field from barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
emily field -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i just wanted to ask on the business in china. i know you had a -- innovative medicines had a very strong quarter in first quarter.
but just, you know, if you are seeing any impact as we get into second quarter from lockdowns in some of the major cities, or just any impact on the broader business. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
maybe, i'll give the china question to harry. harry on china.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, emily. so, overall, we have seen very limited impact in china, as you say, in quarter 1, not at all. and in quarter 2, of course, we are daily monitoring when there is a city or an area with a risk of lockdown, usually then wholesalers should bid earlier to ensure that pharmacies and hospitals on the ground have product.
and -- so we don't see really impact, very marginal only. and of course, we continue to monitor that. i mean, it's one of the reasons why we also kept our forecast assumptions. you know, should this spread bigger, there would be likely some impact.
but we have kept the forecast assumption that we need to see continuation to return to normal prescribing behaviors. and china certainly is one of the focus areas for that forecast assumption. but again, so far, we don't see or very limited impact of this. and we will continue to monitor and provide you an update on quarter 2.
emily field -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of tim anderson from wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions on cosentyx. q1 in the u.s. was a little bit weaker versus what we're expecting, and i'm wondering why.
and then, also, just wondering how to think about that product in 2023 as humira faces biosimilars and as abbvie tries to lock in formulary placement for that product, for humira. and then skyrizi, their goal is to preserve volume with humira. they'll do that through stepped-up rebating. and i'm imagining that puts a fair amount of new pressure on products like cosentyx and other brands in the category.
is that a fair assessment? and does that kick in only in 2023 and beyond? and does that at all pose a risk to the $7 billion peak sales guidance.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, tim. i mean, we remain confident in the $7 billion-plus peak sales guidance. when you look at the dynamics in quarter 1, this is pretty standard for us when we look at reverifications, as well as the other elements in the u.s.
to get patients confirmed for the remainder of the year. within the, i would say, dynamics we've historically seen for the brand, we saw good volume growth overall with cosentyx, particularly in rheumatology. that said, in the u.s., we would expect to be growing in the single-digit range in the next two years until we get our new indications and new formulations online, which we then think will give us the next wave of acceleration. cosentyx's additional growth will be driven by our strength in europe, as well as the china nrdl listing and launches elsewhere around the world.
so, it's a combination of those factors that will drive the growth in the next two years. and then the new indications, new formulations, etc., will give us the next boost which we believe to get us over that $7 billion mark. and in terms of the specifics on the humira dynamics, etc., again, i think that's all built into the forecasted numbers that i gave you right there. we feel confident in our overall contracting position, given the volumes we currently have with cosentyx and the positions we have with the relevant formularies.
next question, operator? thanks, tim.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of peter welford from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks. i wanted to come back to sandoz. you flagged that there were certain one-timers in the quarter that boosted 1q.
i wonder if you could just talk a little bit about those and what the impact of them was. and also, if you look at the margin of sandoz, obviously, a lot of that was boosted by some of these one-time effects presumably in the easy comp. but can you give us any sort of idea of that sort of significant year-on-year gross -- sorry, core operating income margin improvement? how much of that do you think is actually sustainable and due to some of the efficiency measures within? and how much of it, on the other hand, is just something we should assume is a 1q one-time effect to help us guide think about the quarters coming forward? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, peter. i'll give that one to harry. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah, peter, thank you. as you have seen, you know, sandoz has improved. the margin was a low base prior year by basically 330 basis points, call it three margin points to close to 22.8%. now, roughly two points of those come from cost of goods, a little under 1% from sg&a and then 0.6% from oie, where we would have these little divestment gains.
as you know, everything above 25 million divestment gains, we would always co-adjust. sometimes, not too often, we have little divestment gains that are below 25 and then they would stay within oie. but the overall oie bucket, you know, went from recall -- correctly, from a minus 11 million oie effect, total oie, prior-year quarter 1 to plus 7 million oie number in 2022. so, the absolute numbers are small, it's 18 million total oie impact, which is that 0.6% of margin or four points of a 26% improvement.
so, the core margin, if you take that little oie effect out, it's like 22%. so, overall, not significant. but of course, we mentioned it, when the oie contributes to the overall improvement. so, if you take that out, that is not a bad representation, also a very good representation of the underlying profitability.
and then we have to see over the next quarters how pricing will do. and of course, how much the cough and cold season will be back to fully normal. and the other thing is, of course, given the larger cost of goods, percent of sales, the energy cost, and some of the supply price inflation, how much we offset from productivity. overall for the company, i'm very confident we do that.
within sandoz, we have to watch that, given the bigger part of the p&l is innovative medicines.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
terrific. thanks, harry. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much for taking my questions. vas, if i look at the last six months since you reported the third quarter on october 27 -- 26, you've announced the strategic review for sandoz, you've done the roche stake sale, you've reorganized the innovative medicines business and today announced this new kind of initiative on kind of big growth kind of a new seat on the ecn. just wondering kind of -- is there a common theme across these four initiatives? it seems that you're doing a lot on a very short period of time. so, just trying to get a sense for what's driving these measures.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, keyur. look, our goal is to drive outstanding company performance for the benefit of our shareholders, and benefit of patients and society. and i think all of these moves on the first order are creating value for our shareholders.
clearly, evaluating if sandoz fits within the group or is better as a stand-alone company, and we've demonstrated with alcon. we do that in a thoughtful way. in the case of alcon, we created an outstanding stand-alone company. we'll evaluate the same with sandoz.
the sale of the roche stake and buying back our own shares in a place where we view our shares are undervalued relative to the potential of the company and the growth that we have confidence in and that our board has confidence in. again, a value-creating move. reorganizing so that we become much more agile, efficient, take out costs out of the system, improve our overall operating performance both on the top and bottom line generate differential growth. again, i think a very logical thing to do to increase shareholder returns and value and improve the performance of the company.
and then lastly, you referenced, it was kind of part of the reorganization, but the creation of the strategy and growth function is to create a consistent top-level view, do -- what are the right things we need actions we need to take on our internal pipeline versus the external opportunities that we have before us in order to keep a consistent growth as we've guided of the mid single 4% to 5% range in the coming years and then above peer median in the back half of the decade. so, it's about performance, it's about creating shareholder returns, and it's about driving more impact of the company on medicine. thank you, keyur. next question, operator?

thank you. your next question comes from the line of florent cespedes from societe generale. please go ahead. your line is open.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you very much for taking my question. a quick follow-up on sandoz, please. could you elaborate on the performance of the different businesses, if you see any inflection point, especially in the u.s.
where you used to be under pressure from -- strong pricing pressure there. so, if you start to see any inflection point could be very helpful. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, florent. so, overall, sandoz had -- is now getting back to growth globally, but particularly, i would say, europe has had, you know, strong underlying performance, driven both by biosimilars and small molecules. also good performance in our international, as we call it, emerging markets plus japan.
the u.s. still declined in the single-digit range, but we currently have an outlook that we expect in -- over the course of '22 and the first part of '23 to really bottom out on the u.s. oral solids business, which will then allow us to build on biosimilars and new launches to get back to growth. and we expect coming out of '23 and then into the mid-2020s, '24, '25, etc., for the u.s.
business to really grow on the back of biosimilar launches, as well as more first-to-files in the overall injectable and small molecule pipeline. so, that's the dynamic we see, but certainly, still some ways to go -- a little bit more to go in the u.s. to get to the bottom, but that should be coming. and then we get back to growth.
europe is a very solid footing. and in the international markets, we generally tend to do well.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst

thank you. your next question comes from sarita kapila from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
sarita kapila -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hello. thanks for taking my question. how should we think about the lu-psma opportunity, particularly given there's been a restriction to a gallium imaging agent versus gallium and sat that could just limit the number of accessible patients in the overall commercial opportunity? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. for lu-psma, we have currently worked very hard on locametz, our gallium agent, where we are -- we've already secured agreements to have this agent distributed widely among diagnostic centers. so, we expect over the coming months to be able to relieve any constraint on imaging these patients to enable uptake of the medicine.
and as i mentioned, we're leveraging the lutathera footprint, but also beginning to work already in bringing additional centers online. in order to fully capture the earlier-line opportunities, we're going to need to move from roughly 250 centers, where we currently service rlts, to get to over 500 centers, roughly 550 centers. that's part of a multi-year effort. as a reminder, we expect pluvicto in this later-line, third, fourth line prostate -- metastatic prostate cancer setting to be around $0.5 billion to $750 million opportunity.
and really, the more significant opportunity would come from the very large patient populations in the earlier-line settings where we have a readout in the second half of this year, as well as a readout next year within -- current evaluation ongoing to expand into additional lines of therapy to see if the medicine can be more broadly used. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of steve scala from cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much. my recollection is that natalee readout initially was 2023, but that was moved up to 2022. that may have been announced as early as 2019 due to confidence in an interim look. so, what changed since 2019 when things were apparently progressing very quickly? and if the current slow event accumulation is due to delayed visits and therefore delayed event detection as a result of the pandemic, how would that impact the final analysis? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, steve. so, since 2019, we increased the sample -- if my recollection is correct, we increased the sample size of the study up. we certainly increased our overall timeline.
i don't recall exactly, but i'll look into the point you raised around what we said previously on interim, certainly, a very fair challenge. but with the revised 5,000 patients in the study and 500 events, we've been forecasting on an ongoing basis. one thing that is important to note is we did a very detailed look over quarter 1 to ensure that we've collected all events. and to our best assessment, we don't believe this is -- our current event rate is due to delayed reporting of events or over covid impacts.
we believe now we have a clean look at the study and that the event rate is below our projected event rate. unrelated to operational concerns, but just related to the events accrual rate in the study. and of course, we'll keep you updated, but i think our team did a pretty rigorous job over the recent months to really ensure we have all of the best data on hand to provide you this update. thanks, steve.
next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe with ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello. thanks for taking my questions. just perhaps, in the light of your chief strategy and growth officer appointment, maybe you could touch on some comments you made on your recent call when you announced your business reorg on the idea that you're good at getting your pipeline to market but maybe need to get better at getting very big drugs to market. so, there's not too many steps to remove from saying that you might want to think about reprioritizing your innovative medicines pipeline.
so, could you maybe just talk about your process for deciding when not to pursue projects, and whether you think there's such a thing as too big of a pipeline. and specifically, maybe you could talk about how your colleagues are incentivized to shut projects down rather than keeping them alive. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, laura. a big question there. so, a few points -- few points i'd raise, kind of going step by step.
you know, first, we do have, i think, a rigorous approach to prioritizing our pipeline, particularly after proof-of-concept readout through submission. we not only look at scientific factors, scientific traceability, but also look at, of course, npv, enpv, peak sales, return on capital employed, probablized return on capital employed. but i think it's important that we have very good analytics to back up those assessments of those molecules and then make sure that, also versus the competitive set, we've looked at them with silver eyes. so, i think that's one thing we want to upskill in the organization, to have really outstanding information with which to make those decisions and also evaluate against other external opportunities.
then on top of that, i've previously stated that we've increased the thresholds that we're putting in place at an asset level, not necessarily at an indication level. but we want assets that have the potential to be multibillion-dollar assets. that will mean that by exception, we might go after some others when they are strategically -- have a good strategic fit. but it's certainly our goal to find multibillion-dollar assets, and then to have the discipline to say no when assets don't meet those thresholds.
we've also endeavored over the recent years to focus down on therapeutic areas that we really believe we can build scale for the long term. clearly, as andrew mentioned earlier on the call, cardiovascular is a top priority. immunology, given all of the various medicines we have in the pipeline, on top of cosentyx, of course. we have our btk inhibitor.
we have vay, as well as other assets now progressing through. also a priority, neuroscience, given our presence in multiple sclerosis, but also emerging assets we have in neuroscience. and of course, solid tumors and hematology. so, five kind of pillar of tas.
of course, we have some medicines in areas like ophthalmology and respiratory. but we want to have our focus be to build scale in those five priority tas, and again, have the discipline always to chase anything else that might be around in other therapeutic areas. so, i think with those factors in place, we can, over time, really ensure we have the right pipeline to for our company. as i mentioned, over 20-plus multibillion-dollar assets to our current assessment.
but certainly, we'll ask ronny to reassess that and give us an honest look, and to honestly tell us where we're at and what do we need to do, and where does the external environment give us opportunity, and where maybe doubling down on other internal assets give us an opportunity as well. so, a lot, of course, ongoing work, but i think we're on the right track. and we're hopeful and optimistic that with ronny coming on board, we can even accelerate on that journey. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim securities. please go ahead. your line is open.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. so, vas, maybe first question is just, you know, how you see the pcsk9 environment evolving in the context of merck's oral pcsk9 where we're seeing some pretty robust data. i'd love to just kind of get your thoughts there, and then, you know, the evolution of the market as we see it for an injectable therapy.
and then second, just wanted to get a sense of the impact of inflation and how -- you know, what levers novartis has the capability to pull to keep up with inflation? you know, do you see a pricing environment in the united states that can actually facilitate price increases? because it appears that, that won't necessarily be available in international markets. but maybe you can just correct us where our thinking might be wrong, as it relates to the ability for novartis and the rest of the pharmaceutical industry to keep up with inflation. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, seamus. i think on the pcsk9, first, it's important to take a step back and look at the global unmet need. i mean, there's an estimated 60 million-plus patients around the world who have ascvd that are not adequately controlled with current agents.
so, big, big opportunity. in the u.s. alone, 18 million to 20 million patients. so, there is plenty of space here for many agents.
and even if we capture a fraction of that with leqvio, we have a very sizable, sizable medicine. that i think, first, is important as context. it's also important to note with leqvio, our goal is to access that broader market. i mean, if you look at current pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies, they're accessing a fraction of this market.
so, our goal is to grow the market. and with bringing forward a twice-a-year part b medicine and then setting up the infrastructure in cardiovascular care with part b clinics, but then also with population health agreements around the world, we think it's a pretty unique value proposition for an asymptomatic disease to have a twice a year therapeutic versus having chronic therapies, where we know that patients generally don't comply with their statins or ezetimibe or related therapies. so, you know, that's the broad strategy. so, when i think about orals or monthly injectables, i don't think it changes our strategy and our belief that in the long run, the ability to provide twice-a-year medicine through the physician buy and bill and part b model in the u.s.
and population health around the world is a long-term opportunity to address this relatively vast market opportunity. and, i mean, let's see what happens. of course, as you know, in cardiovascular disease, it's a long journey to get from early clinical data ultimately to the patients at the other side of the long journey. now in terms of inflation, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you. and thank you, seamus, for the question. very important, of course, in the geopolitical environment we are living.
i think, i would start with that, usually, also my experience, you know, and given our cost structures, inflationary pressures can be usually well-balanced with productivity measures. and so, you know, we are not very energy-intensive. on the other hand, of course, if inflationary measures get into the personnel cost side, which over time will happen here or there, i think, we have very good productivity programs in place to offset that. and of course, also, our move transformation for growth, which combines, for example, our shared service, together with our manufacturing and supply chain, there, our leader, [inaudible] and his team, you know, will further strengthen the impact of our procurement organization across our complete external spend.
so, that's one element. and, overall, i think we are very well-positioned to fight any potential bottom-line effects off with increased productivity measures. in terms of pricing power, i mean, as you described, it's mainly in the u.s., given our portfolio and business. we have been, within our pricing policies on key brands, increasing in the mid single to mid to high single-digit range in list prices.
we write it depending on the rebates we have to give in a plus or minus low single-digit environment. of course, we look at that also from a competitive standpoint. but of course, we would always price with our commitments. and ex-u.s., there is some limited pricing increases but -- potential, but much less and usually more for sandoz.
we have also some otc elements in the sandoz business. but i think key is for us that we do not, you know, only try to offset unit pricing, but with significant productivity measures, as well as via procurement, ensuring that our suppliers do the same in their productivity efforts and offset inflation as much as possible.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg. please go ahead. your line is open.
kerry holford -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thank you. a question on m&a. given the recent pullback in valuations and seemingly tough ito margins, i wonder, vas, if you can give us your latest perspective on the environment. and in the context of the broader market moves, are you noting more external interest, greater willingness to discuss potential collaborations and m&a opportunities? many thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, kerry. you know, when you look at, of course, the pullback in the xbi and i think i've heard various data points but many companies trading below their -- even the cash they have on hand, i think it certainly points to doing the disciplined look. but i think, first and foremost, we have to be science-driven and really ask if there's science and good data to support an acquisition.
and i think there, as we're seeing in the broader biotech market, it's been challenging. and then i think a lot of data readouts have pointed to the fact that it is hard to find noble drugs, you know, effectively. so, we continue to look. our focus remains, as i've guided in recent quarters, into the sub $2 billion space to see if there are attractive methods.
and when there are good deals out there, we're, of course, looking to do them. i do think over the course of this year as well, expectations among sellers, so to speak, will adjust. and there may be more openness to think about how partnerships and m&a and business development could be conducted. so, there could be more activity certainly in the sector second half of the year.
and we'll, of course, be doing our part to diligently keep screening and see what's out there that could be attractive. thanks, kerry. next, question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of naresh chouhan from intron health. please go ahead. your line is open.
naresh chouhan -- intron health -- analyst
hi, there. thanks for taking my question. just one on the impact of inflation on cost base following off from seamus' question. just a question on the phasing of the impact of inflation on the cost lines.
because i'm guessing you have a bunch of contracts that are longer term, and some suppliers may yet have to raise prices. so, should we be thinking about inflationary impacts on costs in h2? or will that be pushed into next year? and then linked to that, when you formulated your guidance earlier on in the year, do you feel that the inflationary pressures you're seeing now are -- i mean, is fully accounted for?thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, naresh. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, naresh. yeah, we have seen some quarter 1 on energy, like probably in most others. and -- but again, we are not so energy-intensive.
and when we basically forecast out the energy part, as well as the supplier base, as you say. contracts are a bit further out. we see roughly one point of copping as the risk around that. but we have offsetting measures to offset that and be well within our guidance.
and then, of course, the other question is, of course, will this stay here, you know, this situation, for a long time? of course, at the moment, we assume, from a forecasting standpoint, it will remain for the rest of the year. and then beyond this year, i would say, again, we have many levers of productivity to offset that so that we're also very confident in our mid- to long-term op margin guidance, which we did together with the announcement of transforming growth initiatives. so, overall, i would say, given our cost structures, manageable. but of course, we'll ask for some increased efforts to do so.
but we are well prepared.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard parkes from bnp paribas. please go ahead. your line is open.
richard parkes -- bnp paribas -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. just on your innovative medicines, 40% plus margin target, i'm trying to square that with some of your peers. that don't seem to feel that's a sustainable level of profitability.
and given that you're a therapeutically diversified business, i would have thought that would lead to structurally slightly lower overall margins. i wondered if you could just highlight what we're missing or what's unique about novartis that we're overlooking? and just following on from that, keyur mentioned you've been demonstrating willingness to grapple challenges within the business in recent times. and i just wonder if you could update us on your thoughts, of your presence, in some of your subscale therapeutic categories like respiratory and ophthalmology. just wondering whether that might be baked into achievement of that margin target exiting those areas.
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. when we look at our approach longer term, and we want to maintain r&d in the 20% range as we've guided, that we're always willing -- 20% of im sales that, of course, we're always willing to go up based on opportunities if they're highly attractive. and i think you see our peer set moving around some well below that target, some well above that target, but i still think in the long run being in that 20% range is a solid investment level, given the size of the company.
when you think about our sg&a, we want to be at the median or better in the sector over time. and we certainly see peers who are far more efficient than us in the sg&a areas. so, when we take our current im margin, which is in that 36% to 37% range, and we see the opportunities that come with technology, with rationalizing our footprint, with the opportunity to hopefully leverage capabilities in market, we think we can get those four to five points out of sg&a to get us into that 40% range on a sustainable basis. i can't speak to how our peers look at it.
of course, it does require you to rethink your business model. and i think what working on right now in im as part of this new setup is to rethink our country's footprint and our approach to go-to-market in country to make it much more flexibilized, much more technology-driven, and in the long run, we hope, more sustainable to enable us to launch products highly efficiently. and that's where the opportunity comes from. it's certainly not from cutting r&d and our innovation engine.
it's coming from that other part of our p&l. and that's how we think about it. on the portfolio optimization, nothing new to announce other than i think it's certainly -- we are looking as well as part of this transformation how to optimize our commercial footprint, as well as our development footprint based on the new model of a single im unit. as part of that, of course, we're looking at relevant tas.
and of course, in respiratory, we're largely limited to xolair with a small presence in qbm and in health therapeutics, and in ophthalmology, really lucentis and beovu. so, it's naturally part of our thinking how to optimize these two areas. that's certainly something we'll be working on over the course of this year. next question, operator?

thank you. your next question comes from the line of graham parry, bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my follow-up. so, just a question on pluvicto. so, you talked about the fact that your own gallium-based diagnostic is helping or you hope to help with the uptake. but there is some feedback that the 18s diagnostics are easier to use, easier to manufacture.
i noticed that you had done a collaboration deal with an 18s diagnostic manufacturer. so, can that be back applied to the label for the vision indication? and/or can you add it to psma 4 and psma addition trials? or would this just be for a front line?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, graham. so, for the current launch, we are limited to the diagnostic on label. but certainly, for the follow-up indications, we're working hard to put together the relevant data package with fda to hopefully broaden the range of diagnostic agents that can be used.
you can imagine that as part of our discussions with the fda, we put together our best argument to be as broad as possible on diagnostic options for physicians. but at least for now, on this first indication, we'll be limited to the gallium agents. but, over time, we hope to expand that, especially as we go into the larger market segments in the coming years. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matthew weston, credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. vas, it's a question about buy-and-bill. so, since you acquired the medicines company, you've educated us all on the advantages of buy-and-bill and how you hope in the u.s. it's going to help with the commercialization of leqvio.
i'm curious how we should think about buy-and-bill when you're up against it yourself in a competitive environment. and, in particular, i'm thinking of iptacopan versus soliris, ultomiris, and other high-value infused drugs, but also kesimpta versus ocrevus. does that put a meaningful barrier in the commercialization potential of those molecules?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. thanks, matthew. so, one, i think, it's very situation-specific. so, let's take each one of those in turn.
i think, in the cardiovascular segment, when you're trying to displace orals, which have low compliance, certainly, a twice-a-year injectable that can be used in a subcu setting very rapidly for patients who had previous heart attacks is very attractive to cardiologists and we think will lead to meaningful clinical benefit. our expectation is in the rare disease setting, that while there is certainly -- it is certainly a barrier. to be clear, it is certainly a barrier that we have to overcome, that the current agents are used as infused medicines in the buy-and-bill setting. that in this population, it's not a big enough driver of the economics that providing patients an oral option to avoid having to go in and out of the hospital could be highly appreciated, particularly, given the opportunity to be front line and be used on top of the infused agents.
so, our expectation is, again, a lot of this does come to economics. and i think in that setting, the oral medicine has a very attractive profile. and then, i think, in neuroscience, it is very clinic- and situation-specific. we certainly see the highest uptake in kesimpta in segments of the market that are not highly penetrated by buy-and-bill.
and i think in those segments of the market that have high utilization of buy-and-bill, there's less interest in using kesimpta. luckily, in ms, the penetration of b-cell therapies is still relatively low, given the efficacy of these b-cell therapies. so, there is a vast market opportunity to displace the older agents, the braces, so to speak. and that is a big opportunity, and that's 60% of our source of business.
and so, we have ample opportunity there to get into the market and be successful. so, you've got to look at the dynamics in each one. but certainly, in certain instances, buy-and-bill can be a formidable obstacle in our market environment.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.

next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. just following up from the last question, but staying within the cardiovascular domain. amgen has an mrna-based technology which is, once every six months, it will be buy-and-bill. thinking about how you are building out the buy-and-bill infrastructure, i'm just thinking about with -- i'm thinking about how that's going to fit in within that environment?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
you mean for lp(a), andrew, or --
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
for lp(a). yes, sorry, if i said --
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yup.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
yup. sorry, i misspoke.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. so, of course, we're watching, you know, the lp(a) evolution as well, competitive environment. certainly, if sirna, which i understood is quarterly -- i'll have to double-check with my team if it's quarterly or bi-monthly. but certainly, that will be able to be used through the system.
and as we think about life cycle managing leqvio, our goal will be to, of course, also think about ways to continue to leverage the infrastructure that we're building. to be clear, and i think that's your point, andrew, i think our current lp(a) pelacarsen medicine would not be able to leverage buy-and-bill. but again, the size of these markets are so large. we still think there will be a substantial market opportunity as the first-to-market subcu medicines for these patients.
and then, of course, we will -- we are looking, of course, to get to less frequent dosing. we do think to be successful in cardiovascular buy-and-bill, you have to be relatively infrequent. even quarterly, we'll have to see. but certainly, twice a year is a winner, we think, in this market segment.
next question, operator? thanks, andrew.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thank you for taking my second question. it's on cell therapy. i wonder, firstly, vas, if you could elaborate on the statement in the press release about lower demand for kymriah. is that simply the nature of cell therapies in general in this environment, whether there was anything specific to kymriah? and related to that, i see last week, you pushed back the timelines for your genome-edited stem cell therapy for sickle cell from late 2023 to august 2025.
i just wonder if you could give us any color on why that was. thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, on the second part of your question, i'd have to get back to you, simon, i don't know offhand on the genome editing starts. we'll come back to you on that. look, i think on kymriah, just to provide a very realistic perspective, the -- the dlbcl second line, the failure of kymriah in the second-line dlbcl is beginning to hit demand.
and i think we will see kymriah to have less growth over the coming quarters and years and potentially even declines, as our two competitors build out their second-line dlbcl program. so, realistically for us in cell therapies, of course, kymriah is the only medicine indicated in pediatric all, has a broad label in later lines across dlbcl and fl. in the longer term, it really comes down to our next-generation t-charge platform, which we provided data on at the end of last year at ash, where we demonstrated pretty attractive data in both dlbcl and multiple myeloma. and i think in the intervening years, it's really just managing kymriah to provide it to patients to really focus on that next-wave technology, which we expect to have materially lower cogs, hopefully much higher throughput times, better efficacy and safety, and enable the overall business to be significantly more attractive and more in line with other oncology agents in the company.

steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much. kisqali had its first appreciably down quarter, quarter over quarter since launched five years ago. you noted the weakness in new prescriptions. but even during the pandemic, kisqali was, at worst, flat.
i am wondering what other reasons there could be for the current weakness. it seems it could be deeper than simply new prescription trends? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. so, we did have some stocking movements in the u.s. harry, you want to say a word on kisqali u.s., maybe that would help explain steve's questions.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, vas. so, in the u.s., steve, there was a slightly higher year-end stocking effect in the u.s. at the end of december.
that has been worked through in quarter 1. totally for the company, there was nothing significant. but -- so there was an effect on that -- and that was basically impacting the u.s. growth in the high single-digit percent point.
so, that's made a bit worse than what one would expect. so -- but overall, of course, we see also we would -- we need to see more nbrx growth. there, we are just flat, if you will. but that was on a single-brand basis, which is not a small amount, if you will.
that impacted, of course, quarter 1 versus quarter 1 last year comparison.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and we would expect in quarter 2, steve, at least from where we sit today to see it return to the historical profile of kisqali growth. i think we have a few more questions, operator? next question, please.

matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
vas, i promise it's my last. it's on ensovibep. and if you could just give us an update. obviously, covid is waning hopefully or certainly in everyone's hopes, but we're still seeing governments making very significant purchases to stockpile various treatment agents.
so, can you tell us where you are in terms of your expectations for the molecule, but specifically your plans for the subcu trial and whether or not we should expect that to start in the near future?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matthew. as we note, actually, in one of the slides, we filed the eua. and the eua remains open with the fda.
however, at this point, given the latest feedback in our discussions with the agency, we would expect the agency to require a phase 3 study before granting an eua approval or a general approval. we're in discussions now to understand the final study design and what the agency would expect. and then we need to make a kind of sober evaluation as to is it a doable study in light of the waning rates of covid around the world and then we can make an appropriate decision. certainly, we believe in the profile of the molecule and certainly our discussions with the u.s.
government. they're excited about the concept of a one-time subcu therapy. alongside that, we do have a once-a-day oral agent that is currently completing the various preclinical tox in early studies. we should have a read on whether it's developable over the summer.
and then we have to have a similar conversation. it's an mpro inhibitor. and we have to have a similar conversation with fda as to what would be the clinical development requirements, and, again, in the context, is it developable and how long would it take to just accrue the events required. thanks, matthew.

thank you very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i think -- last question, operator? i think it's graham. graham?
operator
thank you very much. graham parry, bank of america. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for that. i'll go for round three. so, just first of all, just a quick follow-up to the first question i asked on natalee, i just wondered, as you're slipping into 2023, is it just slipping into 2023 or on the event rate that you're looking at, at the moment.
is it a first half or second half '23 read? and then on cosentyx is my actual follow-up. you've got the lichen planus phase ii data, i think, this year. it's a large indication, lots of patients. i just wondered if you are thinking about this as a longer-term opportunity.
because on your ip slide, it says cosentyx passes 2029 plus. i'm wondering, are you looking at additional ip protection strategies for cosentyx beyond 2029? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, graham. on natalee, nothing more i can really say at this point. i think we'll continue to update the event rates and provide more granularity on when we would expect a final readout over the course of this year.
but i think we give you the best forecast we have now that it's now pushed into 2023. on cosentyx, we do have the lichen planus readout upcoming. and we are looking at, of course, the standard patent extension strategy beyond 2029, also currently to continuing to progress in nibr, efforts to develop an oral il-17 inhibitor as well as other life cycle management strategies, biologic strategies for cosentyx. nothing concrete as of yet but certainly high on our mind to get cosentyx to move into the 2030, alongside continuing to defend the full patent state of entresto.
we have 10 orange book patents now issued. and our goal continues to be to defend that, to see how -- to try to keep entresto protected for as long as possible as well. so, thank you, everyone, for the call. i really appreciate it.
great questions from everyone. we look forward to speaking to everybody soon. thank you again for your interest in novartis.

operator
good morning, and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q2 2022 results release conference call and live webcast. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call, including the q&a session, will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. with that, i would like to hand it over to mr. smith shah, global head of investor relations.
please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much. and thank you to all of you who've joined us today on this beautiful summer's day for novartis' quarter 2 results. before we start, i'll just read you the safe harbor statement. the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors.
these may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed, or implied by such statements. for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f and its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that, respectively, were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission. and with that, i'll hand the call to vas.
thank you. 
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's conference call. we're pleased to go over the results. i have with me today, harry kirsch, our cfo; and karen hale, our chief legal officer. moving to slide 4, as you saw in the release earlier today, we delivered a solid quarter 2 across each of our key value drivers: 5% growth across the entire company, as well as in innovative medicines in sandoz, continuing our productivity agenda with solid core operating income growth across the business, as well as continued margin expansion in constant currencies; as well as an upgrade to our expected savings from our transformation program to now 1.5 billion.
the innovation milestones, notably, we continue to garner approvals for scemblix, our new medicine for cml, including a positive chmp opinion. and then lastly, three milestones within our esg efforts. first, the $250 million r&d commitment as part of the kigali declaration for neglected tropical diseases. we've increased our commitment to clinical trial diversity over the next 10 years through our beacon of hope project.
we also had an upgrade from msci to now aa rating top quartile within the industry. and we continue to work to further improve our overall esg profile. moving to the next slide, when you look at innovative medicine sales, we grew consistently across the u.s. and in our ex-u.s.
markets, primarily driven by our key growth drivers. we had 6% sales in the u.s., 5% sales ex-u.s. and you now see on the right hand side of the chart, 59% of our sales come from our key growth drivers. and those key growth drivers are now growing at 21%.
and moving to the next slide and zooming in a little closer on the quarter, you saw pretty consistent performance across our key medicines. we'll go through this in a bit more detail. two products i wanted to particularly call out. kesimpta had a very strong quarter, i think, demonstrating its overall profile as a multiple sclerosis therapy of choice.
and kisqali as well is now gaining momentum in breast cancer -- in metastatic breast cancer patients. and we'll talk a little bit more about that throughout the call. now, moving to the next slide. we've really focused attention as a company on six key growth drivers, we believe, which will enable us to deliver the growth profile we've outlined, both in the next five years and also beyond.
notably, cosentyx and entresto continue their outstanding performance toward their respective peak sales goal. we'll talk more about zolgensma, which continues its global expansion. kisqali, i've already mentioned. in leqvio, we're building a strong base with which we believe will enable this medicine to reach a significant sales potential over time.
taken together, these six brands now constitute 32% of innovative medicines sales, and they're growing at 31%. and i'm getting confident in that growth outlook that we've outlined. now, moving to slide 8, and going through each of these key brands, starting with cosentyx. cosentyx delivered 12% sales growth on the quarter.
when you look at the outlook for cosentyx, we continue to guide to a double-digit growth, driven by steady volume growth in the key geographies: u.s., europe and china. we're very confident in the overall clinical profile now that we've treated over 700,000 patients across five of the indicated for cosentyx. and we continue to get important guideline recommendations, including the grappa psoriatic arthritis guidelines, which highlight cosentyx's unique benefit versus alternative therapies, including the il-12/23 and its ability to tackle axial manifestations of this disease. overall, we're confident in the $7 billion-plus peak sales potential.
this will be driven by global expansion of the product, as well as life cycle management, where we had some good progress in the quarter, including approvals in pediatrics in europe. we've submitted hidradendenitis suppurativa in the eu, and we expect to submit in the u.s. in the second half. we have positive data on an iv study looking at cosentyx use in axial spondyloarthritis.
and, lastly, we do anticipate an iv submission in the u.s. as well in psoriatic arthritis for proof points of our ongoing efforts on life cycle management for cosentyx. then moving to the next slide, slide 9, when you look at entresto, entresto is continuing its really dynamic growth globally and in the u.s. you can see we delivered 33% growth with entresto.
our weekly nbrx continues its strong progression with continued strong growth. we've now treated over 7 million patients globally and over 1 million patients in the u.s., growing in hospitals, cardiology, and primary care. so, really strong growth across geographies. and we're confident in the future growth and delivering the $5 billion-plus peak sales potential for this brand.
there's only one-third of the addressable population that's been treated. and we see a strong profile consistently regardless of the setting the medicine is used in. and, lastly, with the approval of entresto in hypertension in japan and china, where there's the high unmet need, it gives another opportunity for future growth. then moving to slide 10, with zolgensma.
zolgensma is continuing to demonstrate the power of a one-time gene therapy to treat really in a dramatic way to a terrible disease like sma: 26% growth driven by global expansion, 2,300 patients now treated. we had recent reimbursement decisions -- positive reimbursement decisions in australia, switzerland, and greece. and we recently received approval for our north carolina new manufacturing facility, which further expands the capacity of our gene therapy network and really brings online a state-of-the-art facility, continuing our leadership in the gene -- the aav gene therapy space. now future growth drivers for zolgensma are going to be that continued global expansion: 43 countries to date and growing.
we also want to enable stronger newborn screening programs outside of the united states. ninety-seven percent of newborns are screened in the u.s. and only 30% in europe. and those numbers are similar or lower in many other geographies.
as we can get more newborn screened, then we believe zolgensma is the treatment of choice for these babies, allows for normalization of their overall development. and we saw that in a nature publication that recently summarized the data from one of our earlier studies with 14 out of 15 patients walking alone, and 11 of them in the normal development window when treated early with zolgensma. i also want to note that both our steer studies and strength studies are progressing well. and we continue to outlook a submission in intrathecal for zolgensma for 2- to 18-year-olds in 2025.
now, moving to the next slide, with kisqali, we continue to deliver double-digit growth. you see 43% growth. and we see this as a brand that given this recent data releases is really coming into a strong profile and strong growth profile. we're seeing increased traction based on the clinical data.
i'll talk more about that a little bit later in the presentation. and we saw that at asco. once again, we were able to highlight some of the datasets, particularly around os in the first-line setting, which demonstrates the strong profile of kisqali. the natalee adjuvant study primary analysis is expected in 2023 and continues to progress on track.
and i'll talk more about that in the pipeline section. then moving to kesimpta on the next slide, slide 12. the launch is continuing to and really continue on a strong trajectory. we see an acceleration of the brand in the u.s., and we continue to work toward providing the medicine globally in our key markets.
we have u.s. demand of 18% growth quarter over quarter. we have 3,200 adopters -- physician adopters since launch. you can see the nbrx up now, 42%.
so, really a dynamic growth for this medicine. and we're working to continue to strengthen the profile and differentiation. we have new extension data, which demonstrated eight out of 10 patients treated continuously with kesimpta that had no evidence of disease activity. from a operational standpoint, we continue to work to drive fast initiation.
patients are now getting on therapy within 66 days, 80% of patients achieving that goal. and 77% of patients remain on therapy at 12 months, which, i think, again, demonstrates the medicine's impact, as well as its ease of use for patients. so, we're very excited about the outlook for kesimpta. then moving to the next slide, on slide 13, with leqvio, we're laying the foundation, as we've outlined in 2022, for the ramp we expect over the coming years.
and we continue to expect in the remainder of 2022 for a steady ramp-up of leqvio. but i think there is important proof points that we're beginning to lay that groundwork successfully. first, with respect to access. and as a reminder, leqvio is under the medical benefit.
we have 65% of patients now covered with -- aligned to our label, or near our label. and that's within six months of launch. this is higher than relevant competitor brands, both from pcsk monoclonal antibodies and/or other recently launched anti-cholesterol therapeutics. and those brands have been on the market for many years.
so, i think it demonstrates we've been able to drive fast access. and the jco now is in place as of july 1. so, i think from an access perspective, we're progressing well, progressing on or ahead of our plan. and i think that sets us up well for the future.
secondly, on affordability, we can now confirm that two-thirds of patients have zero copay for leqvio, including medicare part b patients with supplemental insurance. this again, we believe, will enable a strong uptake and strong adherence to this medicine so patients can get the benefit that they need from lower cholesterol. and, lastly, we're making progress working through logistics and administration for this medicine in cardiologist offices, as well as in relevant hospitals and medical centers. we have increased the number of unique locations, ordering leqvio to over 700.
they're expanding the depth now with 55% of our customers already having placed repeat orders. and we're seeing growing usage now with 2,100 copies and now 3,900 patients in the service center. so, all of this taken together, i think, points to a strong future for the brand. and we'll continue to work through the second half of this year to build out this base to enable long-term growth.
then moving to the next slide, slide 14, with pluvicto, and moving to our two recently launched medicines in oncology, pluvicto and scemblix. the pluvicto launch is really progressing in a strong manner. and it's either at or above our own expectations. we've seen our manufacturing issues remediated, and we've cleared our backlog.
commercial and clinical supply resumed in june. we have a permanent a code that was granted in july. and that will be effective in october. over 50% of insured lives now are are covered.
we have over 100 rlt sites now operational, 40 sites have completed orders. so, a strong trajectory from the start. and we're hoping to maintain that over the coming months. we're preparing for further expansion with this medicine, given the clinical profile we've seen to date.
both the phase 3 studies are on track both in the pre-taxane setting and the hormone-sensitive setting, with the readout for the pre-taxane studies still slated before the end of this year. the manufacturing scale-up is ongoing. we have a new facility in indianapolis that we plan to bring online in the second half of next year. and we have capacity and expansions ongoing in our italy and new jersey sites.
and we're making significant investments to ensure logistics can support access as the patient population that can be reached by radioligand therapies continue to expand across pluvicto, lutathera, and our pipeline. so, moving to the next slide, slide 15, scemblix as well is off to a very strong u.s. launch. and then we achieve the, as i noted earlier, important regulatory milestones in the eu: $31 million of sales, primarily driven in that third line setting; 44% share in the third line, which i think is a good marker, given how recently we launched the medicine; an 16% nbrx share regardless of cml line of treatment.
in terms of future growth for scemblix, it's going to be driven by the first-line study, which is enrolling ahead of plan. just as a reminder, it's versus investigator choice of tki. and the chmp positive opinion in the ex-u.s. markets where we continue to work to get a global rollout of the medicine.
so, moving to the next slide and turning to sandoz. as you saw, sandoz had a really solid quarter in quarter 2. and we've raised the full year guidance for sandoz. and harry will talk a little bit more about that.
when you look at the drivers for sandoz's sales performance, it's primarily in europe where we are a leader or the leading generics company with 4% growth driven by both launches, as well as the recovery of the healthcare systems, we had double-digit growth in the rest-of-world markets, japan and other emerging markets. and we've seen a stabilization in the u.s. business, setting us up with future biosimilar launches and small molecules launches to drive growth in the u.s. over the years to come.
you can see our retail sales growth in the quarter was 4%, biopharma was up 11%. so, we've raised the guidance, as i mentioned. and when you look longer term, we believe this creates a solid base for growth 2023 and beyond. and a lot of that will be driven by the biosimilars portfolio.
the portfolio of biosimilars and sandoz targets $80 billion of originator sales, over 15 assets in the portfolio; and some recent progress, including the acceptance of the adalimumab high-concentration formulation as well as natalizumab in the eu. we also continue to pursue small molecule opportunities to bolster the small molecule portfolio. overall, the strategic review percentage is continuing to progress on track. and we expect an update at the latest by the end of this year.
moving to the next slide, on slide 17, our broad pipeline of novel medicines progress in quarter 2. but we've also worked to focus our efforts, as you saw in both our earnings release, as well as with some of our pipeline decision. five core therapeutic areas while being opportunistic in other therapeutic areas. and we're trying to make consequential decisions to really ensure we're focused in and getting scale on those five core therapeutic areas.
on this slide, a few things to highlight. we had important designations in milestones. scemblix, i've mentioned. pelacarsen completed enrollment for the phase 3 horizon study, so on track on its journey to become the first medicine to treat lp(a)-driven cardiovascular outcomes.
jdq443, our g12c inhibitor for solid tumors, the phase 3 study in second and third line nonsmall cell lung cancer was initiated. and we continue to also progress combination studies for that medicine. cosentyx was filed -- had a filing for hidradenitis suppurativa in europe. and we continue to work toward the u.s.
filing. and then, lastly, we continue to streamline the portfolio. we had a number of projects that we made the decision to either partner or stop. and, notably, we're exiting our efforts, development efforts in copd and general asthma with the decision to partner to assets in that portfolio.
and we'll continue to look to streamline the medicine portfolio inner pipeline so that we can focus on the medicines that matter most in our core therapeutic areas. so, moving to slide 18, i did want to say another word on kisqali. given the os benefit now we've seen across all three of the phase 3 trials in the metastatic setting we've conducted today, on the left hand side, you can see the results that we've generated in the first line of metastatic setting. you can see an impressive risk reduction and importantly median os that's been achieved consistently across these three studies, the longest median os ever published.
and we've seen that same os benefit regardless of situation. we also maintained that benefit even after prior cdk 4/6 use. we think this data set is part of the reason we're seeing the real growth acceleration behind kisqali. now, in the middle frame, you see, the reason for this clinically, we believe, is that kisqali is unique in its ability to hit the cdk 4 target.
and we hit it eight times harder than we had cdk 6. and that's relevant because we believe cdk 4 is the key driver of the benefits you're seeing for this medicine. and you can see our relative performance versus -- in preclinical studies versus our competition. now, when you look at the adjuvant study, it's fully enrolled as we've already noted.
we've already cleared the first futility analysis. the primary analysis is planned at 500 idfs events. and we expect that by the end of 2023. the two interim analysis are to be conducted at 350 and 425 event.
we have not yet reached the first of those interim analysis. we expect that in the coming quarters. we do guide for this study to really complete at the end of next year when we reach the full number of events. but we'll, of course, keep the markets updated as we progressed through these interim analysis.
then moving to the next slide, on slide 19, you know, we're on track largely against our key 2022 events. just three things to note: three submission-enabling readouts coming up in the second half of this year, canopy a, iptacopan, and pnh, and as already mentioned, pluvicto in the pre-taxane setting. so, we look forward to those study readouts and updating all of you as we get that data in-house. so, with that, i will hand it over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you very much, lars. good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the second quarter and the first half.
and as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless otherwise noted. so, on the next slide, yes, we show our quarter 2 and half 1 financial results summary. as you can see, quarter 2 sales and corporate income both grew 5% in constant currencies, with sales benefiting from the continued strong performance of our key growth brands and core operating income growth driven mainly by the higher sales. however, operating income and net income declined significantly in the quarter.
and this was mainly due to prior-year investment gains from tail-end products and higher impairments and higher restructuring costs this quarter, mainly for the transformation for growth program. core eps grew 1%. however, if you exclude the impact of the prior-year roche income, core eps would have grown 10%. overall, we delivered solid sales and core operating income growth for the quarter, resulting also in a strong operational half 1 performance, with sales growing 5% and core operating income, 7%.
core eps in half 1 to 11%, excluding the low stake impact. on the next slide, i would like to drill down a bit into the performance by division. so, for quarter 2, you can see that innovative medicines' top line through 5% and the bottom line, 6%, resulting in an improvement in the core margin of 50 basis points to 37.2%. sandoz's net sales also grew 5%, although core operating income decreased 4%, many due to increased investments and higher other expenses.
this was reflected in the core margin which decreased to 20.4%. overall, for the first half, we saw strong performance for innovative medicines and sandoz; innovative medicines sales growing 5% and core operating income, 6%, in half 1. sandoz grew 6% on the top line and 10% on the bottom line in half 1, driven by a very strong quarter 1. and as a reminder, as we discussed in april, sandoz benefited from a return to its normal business dynamics compared to a lower prior-year base.
our half 1 core margin improved by 30 basis points for innovative medicines, 70 basis points for sandoz, and 60 basis points for the total group. turning now to our guidance on slide 23. so, within the divisions, we expect innovative medicines sales growing mid-single digit and core operating income growing mid- to high-single digit ahead of sales. the expected core margin increase will be driven by expected continued good top-line momentum and continuation of our productivity programs, of course, including the new organizational structure, giving us some benefits in the second half already.
for sandoz, the performance year to date allows us to upgrade sales guidance to low-single digit, which is a one-notch upgrade, and core operating income guidance is upgraded by two notches to now be broadly in line with the prior year. for group, we confirm our overall full year guidance. we continue to expect both top and bottom line to grow mid-single digit in 2022. the key assumption for this guidance is that we see a continuing return to normal global healthcare systems, including prescription dynamics, and that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics would enter in the u.s.
in 2022. as many of you know, in june of this year, the u.s. appeals courts held the gilenya u.s. dosing regimen patent invalid.
we plan to petition the appeals court for further review to uphold validity of this patent. and as a reminder, there's no generic competition in the u.s. at this point in time for gilenya, in quarter 2, u.s. sales were 332 million for gilenya.
it is worth noting that u.s. gilenya sales have been steadily declining due to competitive pressures and, of course, our key focus on [inaudible] on kesimpta. next slide, please. i would like to provide some further details on the expectations for the second half dynamics of top and bottom line.
we expect sales to continue to grow mid-single digit, bringing us to our guidance for the full year. for half 2 core operating income, we expect to grow slightly slower compared to half 1 at low- to mid-single digit. this is mainly due to the higher per-year base for sandoz in half 2. as you know, half 1 core operating income growth benefited partly from a very low price base at sandoz.
we will, of course, continue to monitor the impacts of inflation and utility costs, particularly on the sandoz product portfolio, as well as the situation around covid-related lockdowns in china, given that we are seeing improving signs as of june, which we will continue to monitor on half 2. on the next slide, i would like to provide an update on our new simplified organization model and the financial impacts of the restructuring. as vas discussed earlier, we have increased our estimate of sg&a savings to approximately 1.5 billion. we anticipate the savings to be fully embedded by 2024.
this year, we also expect some savings. but the overall impact will be minimal as we will be offsetting higher energy cost and inflationary pressures. part of the 1.5 billion savings we expect to be reinvested into our pipeline and a significant part that contributes to achieve our mid- to long-term, low-40s innovative medicines core margin guidance. with regards to the one-time restructuring costs, we could narrow this arrangement.
and we estimate each now to be one time to 1.2 times of the annual structural savings of 1.5 billion. on slide 26, i want to provide an update on expected currency impacts if currencies stay at the current levels. obviously, currency impacts are significant this year, given the strengthening u.s. dollar against many currencies.
so, if currencies stay as they are now for the full year, we estimate the impact on top line to be negative 6% to 7% points, and on the bottom line, negative 7% to 8% points. and given it's volatile, we wanted to give you a little bit of outlook for 2023. so, for the full year, 2023, we would expect sales to be impacted by negative 2%, and core operating income, negative 2% to 3% in 2023 versus 2022. as a reminder, we update these currency impacts on our websites monthly, and i think, especially in these times, quite important to watch that.
finally, on page 27. thank you. finally, a reminder about our capital allocation priorities, where we remain disciplined and shareholder-focused, of course. we aim to balance investing in the business with returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share buybacks.
in the first half, our investment in the organic business was $4.5 billion in r&d and 500 million in capex. we also had bolt-on m&a, which was around 0.9 billion, mainly for the gyroscope acquisition. alongside this, as you can see, in terms of return on capital to shareholders, we paid our annual dividend of 7.5 billion earlier this year and have 9.4 billion still to be executed of our ongoing 15 billion share buyback program, of which we have completed 5.6 billion by the end of june. and with that, i hand it back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. so if we move to the last slide, slide 29, we continue to progress against our top 2022 priorities as we've outlined successful launches, particularly, ensuring the foundation is laid for leqvio; the driving of the dynamic performance of kesimpta, pluvicto, and scemblix, which as you've seen, are continuing apace; maintaining the growth momentum across our six key inline growth drivers; progressing the pipeline, where we have 20-plus assets where we expect significant sales potential with approval potential by 2026 and the pipeline is on track. we are tracking well on our sandoz review and a bit of solid quarter from sandoz in quarter 2. we'll keep you updated as we move toward an update before the end of 2022 at the latest.
and we remain disciplined in our business development and looking for important opportunities to build out our pipeline but remaining disciplined with how we allocate our capital. continuing to deliver our returns, and you've seen that with our productivity initiatives, our increase to 1.5 billion of sg&a savings with our new organizational model. and we continue to reinforce the foundations, we believe, that in the long run will drive novartis' performance around culture, data science, and, as i noted earlier, esg. so, with that, we look forward to taking your questions.
the questioners, please limit themselves to one question. we will be able to get through hopefully the list, and a lot of people have asked multiple rounds over -- over the course of the call. so, operator, we can open the line for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we will now take our first question from matthew weston from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. a question on kisqali, please, vas. and you have very clearly set out the interim analysis timelines and the final analysis timeline. one question that we've received a lot in recent weeks is how you would communicate when you go past an interim.
would you consider that a material event which you have to press release to the market? obviously, if it's positive, it would be positive and we've seen a release. but if you simply pass an interim and move forward, would you see that as requiring a press release? or would we simply learn that at the next quarter where you would update the timelines? many thanks, indeed.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matthew. so, i think as you outlined, clearly, if at any time in the study that we either get a definitive positive result as determined by the dsmb or a negative result, we would update the market. otherwise, our plan would be at the quarterly call to provide updates on where we stand on the study.
we don't believe passing an interim analysis warrants any sort of further update. thank you very much, matthew. next question, operator?
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. i'll jump back in the queue.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of tim anderson from wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. just a high-level question on healthcare reform. and, you know, just talk of reconciliation pushing ahead. it seems like it's finally going to happen to us, at least, your thoughts on the likelihood of this happening, and what it could mean to industry financials and to novartis specifically over time, and if you have certain products that you think would be impacted the most.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, tim. i think as everyone is reading in the press, there is renewed momentum behind a reconciliation package, which would consist of a drug pricing reform and supporting aca subsidies. of course, our overall view remains that there are good and bad elements to the package.
clearly, part d reform is needed. capping out of patient -- patient of pockets will be, i think, a positive step, enable patients to fill their prescriptions and also enable from our sector demand to be supported. but of course, there are onerous elements as well, which we think go too far and don't support long-term innovation, will have detrimental effects to the long-term outlook for the industry, particularly the negotiation elements. now, for novartis, specifically, we view these as not significant impacts in the near to midterm.
we've analyzed this quite in a detailed manner. i mean, i think, as is well known, we're the no. 1 pharmaceutical company in europe and a leader in many emerging markets. our business in the u.s.
is one we plan to grow significantly over time. but our relative exposure to the peer set in terms of both government programs and overall u.s. sales is at the low end of the peer set. so, we would expect to have a far lower effect than our -- impact on us relative to our peers.
and so, i would say in the near to midterm, not a significant impact, overall net of the positives we get from the part d reform and, of course, the impact from inflation caps, as well as negotiations. that's how we see it at the moment. but, of course, we'll continue to analyze as the final bill text is available.

your line is open. hello, richard. your line is open. are you on mute? as there is no response from richard, i will go to the next --
richard vosser -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello. sorry, i apologize, completely my fault. just on kisqali, if you can hear me now. just wanted to go back to the growth potential in the first-line opportunity, and how much of the ibrance market you think you can take with the os benefit? obviously, we can see verzenio benefiting as well, but just your thoughts there.
thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. you know, with kisqali, we're starting to see a positive trend on nbrx in the first half of the year versus the competition in the metastatic setting. and that comes primarily from ibrance.
and i think that's reflective of the data set that we have in os as i've outlined. it's important to note as well in many european and ex-u.s. markets, we are either no. 1 or close to no.
1, depending on the market. and we can, we believe, drive additional momentum in those ex-u.s. markets as well. so, i think it's positive signs.
we want to see that trend continue for hopefully a couple more quarters, particularly given that now the dynamic market within breast cancer is starting to recover. i would note that it's just recently on our data coming back to where it was pre-covid, which again is an opportunity for us to gain share as there's an opportunity to get either new patients or switching patients onto kisqali. so, i think it's all positive directions, and we'll see how the trend goes in the coming months. thank you, richard.

emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perhaps, i'll take one on sandoz, please. as you called out, biosimilars clearly the key to returning to reasonable levels of growth in the midterm. you recently filed the biosimilar humira-hyrimoz high dose in europe. could you just give us an update on where you are with respect to the u.s.
for that opportunity, i.e., both as regard to high-dose filing and potential interchangeability? and how significant an opportunity you think that may be for the business and indeed whether that would have any influence on your considerations on strategic options? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, emmanuel. so, we're on track overall to be launching humira -- the adalimumab biosimilar ad market formation in the u.s. and it's our intention to have the high-concentration formulation available.
i think, as soon as we have a file accepted by fda, we'd, of course, put out a release and update the market. so, i would say, overall, we're on track with respect to that. i think, clearly, the number of entrants when the adalimumab market formation happens will mean that it will be a highly competitive market set. but, nonetheless, given the size of the opportunity, it will help meaningfully drive growth for the brand.
i would also note that natalizumab, where we are one of the early entrants is a significant opportunity for sandoz. and i think natalizumab both in the u.s. and europe is one we're excited about as an opportunity to drive growth within the next few years. and the other upcoming opportunity for us is denosumab, where, again, i think we would be one of the earlier entrants among biosimilars players.
but those would be the three key upcoming biosimilar launches for sandoz and particularly in the u.s. next question, operator?

thank you. your next question comes from the line of graham parry from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my questions. so, i'm just -- i'm going with kisqali, so, i think at the q1, as you said you were at 300 events. so, i wonder if you could give us an update on how many events you're at in the trial. and is that the sort of event rate as it sits that you still have a couple of months delay before the dmc report to you what the outcome of those interims are? and in the event you were to get positive data, to what extent can you put subgroup analysis, etc., in the press release, so whether you've hit across all subgroups, high-risk, low-risk, etc.
just what would be in the press release would just be quite interesting to know. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, graham. on kisqali, obviously, i don't want to get into what exactly the number of events are. i would say the event rate that we've seen, and as we noted previously, we had a slower event rate than we had originally projected.
and that event rate has continued. so, there's no change in the overall event rate. i would also note that you are correct that from the point of a lock, it does take a few months to get the readout with the dmc and particularly because we work with one of the large cros in the u.s. as part of the study.
so, that's, i think, important to note from a timeline standpoint. in terms of what's in the release, i mean, i think we typically would only comment on the primary endpoint. and in this case, that's the idfs across both the medium- and high-risk patient populations. we wouldn't, of course, get into subgroups.
i would also note that the dmc's primary basis for stopping the study would be idfs. we would hopefully see an os trend, but i think that's an important note as well. i would expect that as would be the case normally in such an oncology study, os takes more time to mature. and, of course, we'll have to see how it all unfolds over the coming quarters.

your next question comes from the line of [inaudible] from cowen. please go ahead. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. can you hear me?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. this is steve scala. on remibrutinib, is there any sign of liver tox similar to sanofi's tolebrutinib? and is there any reason to believe that liver tox is a class effect? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve. we've been watching this space very closely. i mean, when you look overall at btk inhibitors in cancer, historically, liver has not been a signal, at least to our knowledge, that's been a significant concern.
and, also, btk is not differentially expressed within liver. so, in our view, this is related to the drug itself, either metabolites or off-target toxicities in the liver. to date, with remibrutinib, we haven't seen any liver signals. we've taken it forward into chronic spontaneous urticaria as its first lead indication where there are two pivotal phase 3s ongoing and then, similarly, now are progressing in our ms studies and also evaluating taking the medicine into other areas of rheumatology, dermatology, etc.
our hope and expectation is that the profile of remibrutinib continues to be clean relative to the peer set, particularly with respect to liver signals. we believe that in the ms market, but also in the dermatology market, it's going to be critical to have a medicine that has a safe profile with -- especially with respect to more complex side effects like liver. so, that's where we stand. and we remain optimistic on that unique profile of remibrutinib based on its chemical design and the lack of any off-target toxicity seen to date.

florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks very much for taking my question. a quick one on kesimpta. could you elaborate a bit on how do you see the dynamic on the ex-u.s.
sales? they are still quite small for the time being but are ramping up nicely. could you give us what should boost the sales here? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, florent. with respect to kesimpta, already, we covered the u.s. land.
i mean we're starting to now move through, as you know, the longer reimbursement processes that were required in europe, canada, and other global markets. so, we would expect to see in the second half and then moving into next year more significant sales contributions from our ex-u.s. markets. of course, the big markets in europe, but i was also recently in canada, where there's a lot of excitement as well about the medicine.
and then to a lesser extent, in asia, japan, etc., where ms rates are lower, but the market sizes are significant. i mean, i think it's important to note in those markets a monthly subcu patient-administered drug is very attractive because of those markets, they're not the same incentive structures around infused medicines, as well as the ability to deload the hospital system by having at-home administration. so, we feel optimistic about the opportunity now for kesimpta as its next wave of growth to really be about a global expansion of the medicine.

emily field -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i just want to ask a question on the development plans for ligelizumab. i believe kind of the slides just mentioned food allergy.
but on clinicaltrials.gov, the pearl-provoke study in cindu still looks to be recruiting. so, just any update on the other indications. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. with ligelizumab, as you know, we made the decision not to take it forward in csu, but we continue to the development program in seafood allergy. we'll complete the program as well in cindu. and we continue to believe the medicine has potential in some of these indications where ige inhibition has demonstrated the ability to impact symptomatic disease, as well as disease progression.
so, we still think the medicine has potential, particularly in food allergy, where if we could find the right setting for its use and get a relatively broad label from the regulators, it would have a significant potential. so, those development programs continue on track, and we would expect the readouts as we note in our documentation.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn. please go ahead. your line is open.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. a quick two-parter question, if i may, please. firstly, on zolgensma. as you talked about the strong ex u.s.
growth, but actually, the growth in the u.s. was pretty impressive this quarter. i just wondered if there's anything to add behind that. and, secondly, on leqvio, i wonder if you could update us on the ex-u.s.
performance, particularly the u.k. thanks so much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. with respect to zolgensma, we were pleased as well to see the performance in the u.s. that's primarily driven by expansion in newborn screening where you'll remember when we launched the medicine, we were down at 60%, 70%, and now we're moving into the mid- to high-90s. and as we get that newborn screening rate up, it tends to be the case that patients who are identified in newborn screening ultimately receive zolgensma.
and so, i think that will continue as we move up the newborn screening, but then, of course, we would expect to be back to a steady state. as with all gene therapies, eventually, you get to the steady state of the ability to identify the diseases at birth in so-called incident population. when you look at the specifics on leqvio ex-u.s., i'd say, in the u.k. as well, we've been systematically building up toward what we hope will be a trend break.
i think the u.k. nhs had to, of course, deal with covid for much of the first part of this year. in the last few months, we've now successfully upgraded and enabled nhs ehr to identify patients who would be able to use leqvio. we have now, i think, over 70% of primary healthcare units with leqvio available on their formularies.
we've launched a large-scale education campaign in the u.k. so, i would expect to see as well, hopefully, a trend break in leqvio the u.k. in the first part of next year as we continue to build that foundation in the second half, and as the nhs works through the backlog it has from, you know, other -- from other diseases because of the covid pandemic. beyond that, we see a very strong uptake in germany with leqvio.
on a per-population basis, the uptake is very good. we've assigned successfully large-scale agreements with certain middle east governments to roll out leqvio at scale in those markets. and then we also continue to work to bring leqvio forward in the large markets of japan and also are finalizing the plan for a filing in china as well. but all of that is going -- of course, again, as always, with cardiovascular launches, it takes time.
but on this one, i mean, absolutely, our goal is to ramp this medicine faster than we were able to in entresto. and obviously, with a runway that goes to the late 2030s, at the very least, the significant opportunity to make this a really, really significant medicine.
simon baker -- redburn -- analyst

thank you. your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg. please go ahead. your line is open.
kerry holford -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. focusing on radioligand therapies and the recent manufacturing delays, can you now confirm that you outsourced supplier from running an inventory building for both lutathera and pluvicto? i wonder if you can also elaborate on your plans for expansion of rlt manufacturing supply going forward and how you work around what you've learned through those recent delays. and is there any risk to recent manufacturing cap result and delay to the ongoing phase 3 psmafore study, which i think is due by year end. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, kerry. so, a couple of points on radioligand therapy manufacturing, which is a challenge, but also, i think, points to why if we can get it right creates a long-term competitive advantage. this is a medicine where you cannot build inventory.
we make the medicine. and depending on whether it's lutathera or pluvicto, we have between three and five days to get it to its relevant site. and so, because of that, you have to be world-class with respect to the supply chain. and it's not something easy, i think, for anyone to build from scratch.
what we've learned is to increase capacity with redundant lines and different manufacturing sites to enable us to ensure we have a steady supply, if we were to have a disruption at any one of our sites, and within those sites to segregate the line so that the one line having an issue doesn't affect any of the other lines. and we've been able to do that now at the relevant sites, particularly in our italian site and in our u.s. site. so, with all of that being said, we've cleared the backlog.
we are now shipping to order successfully. we're also with large centers moving to a model where we provide pluvicto doses ahead. even if they don't have patients ready yet, their supply is there. and, of course, that enables them to book additional patients with confidence.
and then to further expand the supply, we'll be bringing on a third large-scale manufacturing facility in indianapolis. that will actually have automated lines moving away from more manual lines, which just further increased capacity. so, we would expect by mid to second half of next year to have three separate u.s. manufacturing facilities to support the u.s.
for both lutathera and pluvicto, giving us the redundancy large-scale capacity and, of course, the ability then to fulfill what we hope if the data supports it a potential multibillion-dollar opportunity for pluvicto across lines of prostate cancer. and i'd also take the opportunity to say that the feedback, both from the nuclear radiology community, as well as the urology community, which is an important customer base for this medicine, has been very positive to date. with respect to the phase 3 studies, we've been able to fully reopen enrollment. and we currently forecast is no change in time line, either for the pre-taxane study, which is slated to read out before the end of this year, or the hormone-sensitive study, which is slated to read out in 2024.
so, both of those studies now are on track and, if anything, are enrolling slightly ahead of schedule. next question, operator?

thank you. your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim securities. please go ahead. your line is open.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thanks. great. just one quick question on iptacopan. vas, just wanted to get your thoughts on relative positioning in pnh and ahus versus the well-established c5 inhibitors.
just wanted to get your sense of the ability to compete in the treatment-naive setting as well as the sort of patients that are struggling as we look at this first data set and then i think the treatment-naive data set will come in the first half of next year. thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, seamus. we've done a lot of work with the u.s. team here and really to understand the physician expectations and the dynamics.
and, overall, we believe that hematologists would be highly interested in iptacopan, both in the first-line setting and for patients who are not receiving -- achieving an adequate response to the anti-c5 monoclonal. i think, unlike some of the other areas where, you know, a part b-infused medicine can create a barrier, this is a low-enough volume situation where we believe that patient ease of use to avoid having to come in and out of the hospital, also a very safe drug that can be used across lines of therapy would be highly attractive for physicians. so, you're correct, the first data set will be focused, both on add-on therapy as well as switch. and then, we'll have a second data set, the pnh applied study, which would then be in the frontline setting.
and those two data sets together will support the overall filing. we remain optimistic on that pnh. and that, of course, would translate as well into atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in that setting. i'd also note that the opportunity for -- hopefully, everyone on the call is aware for iptacopan is not only in that hematology setting, but we also prepare in the renal setting, where this could be the first medicine approved for c3g glomerular nephropathies, as well as an opportunity to treat patients on the severe end of the spectrum with iga nephropathy.
and then we continue to expand across a range of other factor b-driven diseases. and the unique profile here is a twice-a-day oral with a very, very safe safety profile, which i think for these rare diseases will hopefully make a lot of sense. thanks, seamus. next question, operator?

thank you. your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. a question on your beigene collaboration, a couple of parts. so first, i'm curious whether you could provide some color on the fda's guidance not to file in a monotherapy. i assume that they have western data.
i think they do. so, i'm just curious as to why, is it because they feel the market is well-served, site inspections, or some other? and then, second, you have an option on the beigene ticket. it sounds like roche is now not going to be presenting the interim data at esmo. when do you have to exercise that option? and can you give us any guidance on what you will do given the available data?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, andrew. on the first question on monotherapy, i think the fda's assessment of our overall data set was that it didn't adequately reflect the u.s. population in terms of the number of patients and the standard of care that was used in that beigene-driven first-line study.
so, our focus right now is to finish the filing in the second-line small cell lung cancer -- sorry, esophageal cancer. and then we had very good data in the first-line setting as well. as we announced, that's been pushed back as we await the ability for fda to inspect the facilities in china. and then, hopefully, we'd be able to have both, first and second line in esophageal.
we'd have been hopefully second line in non-small cell lung cancer, and we would expand from there. i do think that the fda is making it very clear now that they expect a -- any studies to be filed that they're global in nature, they have an appropriate amount of u.s. patients, and that the standard of care used reflects standard of care in the u.s. with respect to the anti-tigit, we haven't changed -- no change from our option agreement.
the option agreement is driven off of the data from ociperlimab, the beigene anti-tigit molecule. and so, that option would be based on when their data set becomes available. and we'll continue to wait for that -- their data to mature, which we would expect, i think, if i'm not mistaken, but we can verify in the second half of the -- first or second half of next year. now, in terms of the roche data set, i mean, it doesn't change anything for us.
we'll continue to wait and watch as the field evolves and then make an appropriate decision. i think it's important that we -- everyone would like to understand where is the appropriate use of this medicine and in which pd-1 subgroup, all comers, and if there is a place, which place would it actually be. but for us, there's no change to plan at this point in time. thank you, andrew.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs. please go ahead. your line is open.
laura sutcliffe -- ubs -- analyst
hello. thank you. could you help us understand who the typical u.s. prescriber of leqvio is, who's already prescribing to multiple patients, or who is already a repeat prescriber? thanks.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, laura. i spent -- it's a great question. i spent three days now in the field here in the u.s.
meeting clinicians, visiting hospital centers, visiting larger cardiology centers. i'd say, right now, where we see the strongest uptake are in group cardiology practices where they already have the ability to run buy-and-bill; they make their own decisions on how they want to approach, you know, treating for cholesterol; and how, i think, the infrastructure largely set up and also the scale. so, i'd say group cardiology, mid- to large-sized group cardiology practices have been really, i think, a key area so far for the medicine. combined with, i would say, large-volume cardiologists and smaller practices who are leveraging alternative injection centers where we continue to see solid uptake.
and that's a solid base for us to grow from. now, the goal is to move into larger centers, where you, of course, have to work through the pharmacy and the various p&t committees to get everything set up. there now the j code being in place and the overall clinical experience increasing is helping, and then also moving toward smaller cardiology offices where there is the need to set up buy-and-bill capabilities, which historically have not been in place for those cardiology offices. what i would say, though, is what i consistently hear regardless, and i think our team's here on the ground, is a lot of enthusiasm for a twice-a-year physician-administered medicine that can modify the single most important risk factor in cardiologists' mind for preventing repeat cardiology events -- cardiovascular events.
and i think seeing that and hearing that again and again gives us confidence, gives me confidence that we will work through the logistical hurdles, which seems to be the primary topic and then get this medicine into wide-scale use. i think, we often hear from practitioners, especially when they put the patient on the medicine. and then at the next visit, they see a significant drop in the ldl levels. that's a very winning proposition after a single dose.
and then i think those practitioners get really excited about getting more patients on therapy. so, again, laying all the foundations, but i think all the right steps are being taken to get us to where we need to be. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from gs. please go ahead. your line is open.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
vas, a big picture kind of capital allocation question for you. if you look at slide 27, kind of first half, obviously, it's only first half, which shows that you kind of returned somewhere about $13 billion kind of to shareholders versus investing kind of about $6 billion in businesses and your kind of organic and bolt-on transactions. as we look forward to the next kind of 12 to 18 months, do you expect that balance to be somewhat similar to what we have seen in the first half? do you expect that to be more counterbalanced by greater investments, either from an r&d or an m&a perspective for novartis? and then, just kind of more specifically, you are telling us that you'll provide us an update on sandoz by the end of the year. what is that update expected to be? are we going to get a decision on what you would do? is it going to be -- if you plan to separate it, we will we get details on structuring of separation, etc.? so, just any color you might be able to provide on what that detail or what the update might involve? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, keyur. so, i'll let harry start and then i can add on. harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you. hi, keyur. so, on the capital allocation, of course, the whole thing is a bit skewed by our dividend being an annual dividend, right, 7.5 billion.
so, if you want to do it mathematically, you almost have to half that and put it on two sides, but it's the annual dividend. overall, of course, all of these elements, r&d, we expect to continue to grow in line with sales at least. and so, there will be continued growth on r&d investments. and we don't expect margin leverage from the r&d line as we go forward, more from the sg&a line where also our transformation for growth program is targeted at and where we have some gap to benchmarks and we can -- we have found some structural opportunities, which is great.
and then, in terms of how much it goes to bolt-on m&as, that, obviously, depends on the opportunities we find. and given our very attractive net debt position and strong cash flows and balance sheet, of course, we have quite significant bolt-on m&a firepower, if you will. and if we don't find the right opportunities, of course, share buybacks will always continue to be part of the mix. in terms of sandoz, i think you said it all.
we make very good progress in line with our plans on the carve-out financials and looking at all different options. so, we'd be, of course, happy to give a preliminary decision by end of year. but this is, you know, of course, subject to board approval and from that -- and the progress overall on our whole planning. but end of year should be quite -- giving you some good hints to what direction it goes, given that we take appropriate time for all the homework we are doing on the carve-out financial, separation costs, tax situations, and all of that.
so, it would be -- think end of year later, we should be in a good position to inform you about the next steps here. vas?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
no. that's perfect. i think, harry said it all. thank you, keyur.

naresh chouhan -- intron health -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. some of the work we've done suggests that people costs are around 40% to 50% of the total cost of the industry. and so, my question is, how we should think about the timing on the -- of the inflationary impact on salaries? is it fair to assume that the whole 2022 salaries and, therefore, your guidance has factored in only last year's inflation, and that, really, we have to wait until next year's salary rounds before we start to see this year's inflation baked into your cost base on the salary side? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, naresh. harry, do you want to take that?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. you're absolutely right. i mean, you know, the current inflationary effects, mainly on energy, utilities, freight costs and so on, those cost categories as we speak. on wages and salaries, not much yet, if anything.
so, that needs to be closely monitored. and i would expect this to come more in annual cycles. if there is something short term, it's probably depending on certain countries. of course, we always monitor the markets to be very competitive.
and we have, of course, quite a big, if you will, workforce in switzerland where inflation and wage increases are below, i would say, developed market average. so, from that standpoint, our home base gives us also here a bit of a competitive advantage. but we have to watch it, right? as you say, the wage and salaries are a large portion of the p&l of any pharma company given its innovation-driven and people-intensive business. and we have to watch that and we'll monitor this, of course.
i would say, we believe it is manageable for us, but we have to monitor how the situation develops.

sarita kapila -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. please, could you discuss where you stand on the development of the diabetes and obesity franchise? so, you have the mbl949 in phase 2. i don't believe the mechanism has been disclosed, but it appears to be dosed every two weeks. and you also have an existing cardiovascular and metabolic commercial platform.
and there are a number of assets focused on diabesity in phase 1/2, which remain unpartnered. so, it looks like from today's update, respiratory is less of a focus, but it's not necessarily clear where you stand on diabesity and adding assets around entresto, leqvio, and tqj. thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question. and noted the morgan stanley report as well on obesity. yeah, i mean, i think we, of course, are observing the significant unmet need for better obesity medicines.
and because we do have a dedicated cardiovascular research unit in-house led by shaun coughlin really, i think, a global leader in the thinking on developing world-class cardiometabolic drugs, we do have assets in our portfolio. we have not disclosed nbl, but we are awaiting our phase 2 data on weight loss with nbl. if that's positive, that would be an exciting opportunity to hopefully address with a unique mechanism of action obesity on a large scale. and i think based on that readout, we would determine if we advance other earlier stage opportunities and combination partners we would have for nbl as well as potential external opportunities.
so, i think more to come. certainly observing the need for better obesity drugs and hopefully, alternative mechanisms to those already out there, it's something we're looking at. and we'll keep the market up to date as we learn more.

your next question comes from peter welford from jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. a question on cosentyx, please. you've talked a little bit about the aim for this year, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about next year.
and in particular, you've also talked a lot about humira biosimilars in your plan there in the u.s. can you just talk a little bit about how you see coverage negotiations for cosentyx next year? and perhaps you could just talk about the impact of hs, which i guess is unlikely to be approved for the negotiating cycle this time around. but iv, on the other hand, also available and how you think that fits into the potential patient access dynamics for cosentyx going into next year? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, peter. i mean i think, right now, our assessment is that with the introduction of adalimumab biosimilars that it's a manageable situation. i mean we already have significant gross to nets on cosentyx in some accounts.
in other accounts, we have very strong overall positioning and as a first-line therapy. and, of course, we'll have to see as the upcoming year unfolds, and also how some of the upcoming legislation that potentially might be passed by congress will impact the gross to net environment, given that there would be if the law passed as currently designed, less ability to offset, you know, increased rebates of price increases. i think there is a possibility we see a rethink on rebating at least on the industry side on how the whole structure of the market works. it's all to be determined and to be seen.
i mean, i think for us strategically on cosentyx in the u.s., the goal is within rheumatology and dermatology to grow with the market and you see healthy market growth in both of those categories. and as you point out, expand both in terms of indications, we would hope to get hidradenitis approved over the course of next year, which then means, in 2024, it would be an additional labeled indication for us in a unique labeled indication for cosentyx, but also to expand into -- with iv into other payment settings and to have iv approved, hopefully, across both axial spa, as well as psoriatic arthritis would enable providers to also provide cosentyx in those reimbursement settings. and hopefully, that also helps us manage the overall payer environment. it's probably the best answer i can give at this point in time.
but i think as we learn more in the second half of the year, as we enter toward the january negotiations in q4, we'll keep you posted. next question, please?
operator
your next question is from the line of matthew weston from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. just a couple of follow-on housekeeping items, please. harry, in the quarter, we saw a significantly lower finance charges and also significantly lower corporate costs than consensus was anticipating. i know there was a hyper-inflationary write-back in the finance charge.
can you give us any help with what we should anticipate for both those lines for the full year? and then, if i can cheat and ask another question, vas, you obviously deemphasized copd within development. does that mean that we can n anticipate that you may consider divesting your legacy respiratory assets or that's something where you're going to maintain an existing commercial franchise? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, matthew, welcome to the second round. so, on the corporate cost, you know, we guided so far to 600 million to 650 million this year. our new guidance now would be a notch down, 550 million to 600 million.
now, the biggest piece of that is actually currency. because, as you can imagine, given our headquarters in switzerland, most of our corporate costs are in swiss francs. and the swiss franc also weakened versus the dollar. so, the corporate dollars, if you will, will be a little bit less and will be a bit lower.
if you take in constant currencies, it's probably hard for you to model on corporate costs, right? this year's quarter 2 costs were only $5 million lower than last year's quarter 2 cost. and of course, we do also work on corporate cost efficiencies. so, i think that is just the corporate part. in terms of the core cost on net financial results, we, of course, do have some income, right? we have some hedging gains, which is the other side of the currency impact.
so, that should also be a little bit lower. but, of course, both of this is the -- corporate costs are part of our core operating income guidance in constant currencies, and then, a bit of gains on the net financial results also versus prior year, but not so significant.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, harry. and then, matthew, on the respiratory side of things, i think as you rightfully point out, we do have a business in inhaled respiratory laba, lama, ics outside of the u.s., primarily in europe and, to some extent, in emerging markets. and as well as we have the xolair business outside of the united states in severe asthma as well as the co-promote in the u.s. all those businesses remain intact.
and, of course, we will continue to continue to drive them. we always do evaluate, you know, what is the right mix in the markets. and i think with our recent -- the transformation announcement where we moved to a single innovative medicines unit in every country that we operate in, we are going through an exercise to ask what is the right portfolio -- not necessarily specific to respiratory, but what is the right portfolio of medicines for us to really focus our resources on and where can we optimize or deprioritize so that we drive the most growth out of the business and really have the most impact that we can from the portfolio. so, as we get to better clarity on those decisions.
and if anything changes, we'll, of course, let you know.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
i don't know if my mic is on. i don't know whether a follow-up is appropriate. but could we see those spun out with sandoz given that they'd fit with that kind of long life cycle ex-u.s. footprint that sandoz have?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so, i'm getting in trouble with all of my ir colleagues for taking your follow-on, matthew, but i will answer it since we know each other for so long. right now, our intention is not to move any of our innovative medicines business with any consideration with sandoz. we'll keep sandoz in pure play, small molecule generics and biosimilars business.
matt weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. and sorry for that.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, matthew. next question, operator?
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein. please go ahead. your line is open.
wimal kapadia -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thanks very much for taking my question. so, just firstly, with kisqali, you previously suggested that adjuvant is a 6 billion opportunity. but i'm just curious how we should think about it.
because when you look at the epidemiology, it would suggest a much larger opportunity in intermediate patient pool. so, i'm just curious what assumptions you're making in terms of which actually receive the drug in this population because really, if you see a decent penetration, the market potential should be significantly larger. and then just to be tricky because we've done one round. just on sabatolimab, given the delay in filing due to needing phase 3 os data and the high hopes, you know, that physicians seem to have for venclexta and mds in the verona trial, i'm just curious how you're thinking about the potential for the product in mds at this point.
does it now become somewhat of a lower priority, or do you still believe that greater than 1 billion opportunity you discussed previously in mds is still feasible? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, wimal. on kisqali, in the adjuvant setting, we do believe that with the possibility of adding intermediate risk on top of high risk, that is a significant expansion in the patient population, probably 3x to 4x what we see in the high-risk patient population. we previously guided to, i think, 6 billion based on what we saw in kind of consensus outlooks in various market projections.
but i mean i would agree that if we are successful in demonstrating a meaningful benefit across that entire intermediate risk range, there could be a larger opportunity for the medicine. and we're certainly doing that work now as we move toward the final readout of the study. so, i agree, it is a significant opportunity and to be a fundamental inflection point for the company if kisqali is successful and most importantly, for all of those women with breast cancer who need better therapeutics so that their cancers don't recur. but i think it's a good push, and we'll try to come back with better numbers.
on sabatolimab, i think the data that we have suggests that we need to wait for the os data in phase 3. the opportunity for this medicine is both across aml and mds. we do know that there is a rapidly changing treatment landscape in mds. nonetheless, we think that if the medicine has a unique mechanism of action with targeting tim3 and could be used in combination with other agents and if the safety profile would reasonably hold up, we do think it has that $1 billion potential in each of the indications.
but i would know, if we need to wait now for the full phase 3 studies. and it wouldn't be prudent to put too much more on to it until we see that data readout.
wimal kapadia -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
next question, operator? and we'll try to do as many as we can in the last five minutes.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard parkes from bnp paribas. please go ahead. your line is open.
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
all right. thanks so much for taking my question. just a follow-up on leqvio in the u.s. feedback we've received recently from u.s.
physicians is that they're still seeing difficulties accessing injection centers and the reimbursement is still challenging. so, i just wondered whether that's just an issue of experience and lack of infrastructure or whether there are the barriers that payers are putting into place in order to manage utilization such as requirements for specific injection centers or anything we haven't expected? and then can i just ask a clarification because i think i heard you say that the final natalee readout was the end of next year, but i might have missed that. so, could i just clarify that timeline? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. so, first on natalee, it would be in the second half of next year, which i think is what we guided to previously, not end. i didn't mean to give a new timeline. timeline is exactly as we've said previously, so no change in timeline.
on leqvio, i think there is an element of experience and also understanding the part b and the payer dynamic. there is 30% to 40% of patients who are in medicare part d fee-for-service that don't have any relevant blocks and can access the medicines. they assess patients where there is a prior authorization and then there's a set of patients that do have a step at it. and i think physicians are just getting experienced seeing how, you know, different patients actually have to move through the system.
i think as they get smarter about that and understand those dynamics, as offices get better and as we get better in supporting offices, we should be able to overcome those. and as i noted, we have a very high percentage of patients covered now to the full leqvio label. to my knowledge, there's no restrictions on which alternative injection centers or other administration centers that can be used that would really be impacting that perception. i think it's just if you happen to put a certain -- a patient on certain insurance as the first patient through the system, you do have to work through the reimbursement hurdles and get that all set up in the office.
normal things for a u.s. healthcare launch in cardiovascular. i think that we're well adept at managing having successfully launched entresto in things we're working very hard to resolve as quickly as possible. next question, operator?
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of richard vosser from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
richard vosser -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for the follow-up. just one on the loes that we should expect in '23. i think promacta is slated, but there are some formulation and use patents that might actually push that out.
and maybe similarly, just anything else like lucentis that we should be thinking about? thanks very much.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, richard. yes, on promacta, we're continuing to work to really support all the full range of patents we have on the medicine. i think in appropriate time, you know, if we're successful, we'll provide an update on promacta.
but it is something we're very focused on. and then, on lucentis, you know, we do expect the biosimilar -- a few biosimilar entries in europe. i think it's important to note that with the broad scale availability of avastin for now many, many years that we believe the biosimilars market has -- in effect, already happened in europe. so, we would expect a moderate decline on the launch of the biosimilars, but maybe not what you would see with other biologics when biosimilar entry occurs.
so, that's how we're forecasting lucentis now for the coming years. and one last question, operator?
operator
thank you. your final question comes from the line of graham parry from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my follow-up. so, just one on gilenya. so, obviously, you've had the overturning the decision from the appeal court, and you said you're going to petition. so, just help us understand time frame for the petition? does that prevent a launch happening in the intervening timeframe, so your level of confidence that we won't see a launch this year? or is the guidance just a guidance assumption but that could change depending on what happens with the court? and then, just one last one, kisqali growth which is well above prescription growth, although, obviously, we are seeing resurgence there.
is that reflective of real volume growth, or could it be just a sort of prescription retail versus other channels that we're seeing and actually the reported growth is much more in line with the real volume growth? thank you.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yeah. on gilenya, right now, no generics can enter the market. we are petitioning the court. and we would expect to get a response from the court in the coming months.
if granted, then it would be another set of months before the hearing and then the hearing will take another set of months. as a reminder, we guided to generics entering in 2024. so, really, what we look at here is between now and that timeline when exactly the entry might happen. so, we'll know more, i think, as the court gives us feedback once we -- we have -- yes, we are in the process of submitting the petition.
the petition would then need to be reviewed. we'd either be rejected at that point or the petition would be granted, and then we would then move forward from there. so, that's kind of the scenarios right now on gilenya. but to remind again, the long-stop date was any way in '24.
so from a midterm growth standpoint, this is not having a significant bearing. also, in europe, where we were granted the patent by the european patent office, we expect that patent to be issued later this year, and we'll continue to defend gilenya across europe. so, a lot of things, puts and takes, i think, on gilenya at the moment. and i think on your question on kisqali, i don't know the answer, so we'll just have to follow up with you.
but we'll get back to you on that to make sure you're clear on the volume price dynamics. but i would say that what we see in our numbers is a strong growth in underlying demand for kisqali that we'd like to sustain. so, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. apologies we didn't get to every single question.
but i really appreciate everyone taking the time, and we look forward to catching up soon. bye-bye.

operator
good morning, and good afternoon, and welcome to the novartis q3 2022 results release conference call and live webcast. [operator instructions] the conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] a recording of the conference call, including the q&a session, will be available on our website shortly after the call. and with that, i would like to hand over to mr.
samir shah, global head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
thank you very much, and good morning and good afternoon, everybody. thank you again for taking the time to participate in novartis' quarter 3 conference call. before we start, just a quick reminder of the safe harbor. the information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors.
these may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. for a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company's form 20-f, its most recent quarterly results on form 6-k that respectively were filed with and furnished to the u.s. securities and exchange commission. and with that, i'll hand across to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, samir, and thanks, everyone, for joining on today's conference call. moving to the first slide, we take a couple of slides forward. novartis delivered solid quarter 3 performance really across all of our core value drivers. from a growth standpoint, group sales were up 4% in constant currencies.
that was driven both by solid performance in im at 4% as well as in sandoz. u.s. im sales were up 8%, consistent with our strategy to continue to improve our position in the u.s. market.
from a productivity standpoint, group core operating income was up 5%, again driven by im, which was up 7%. we also had continued our margin progression with a one percentage point improvement. our savings from our sg&a program are on track and harry will cover that in a bit more detail. from an innovation standpoint, we had some important events, particularly the approval of pluvicto with a positive opinion in europe from the chmp.
and the readout we had and announced earlier this week of iptacopan in pnh across two superiority endpoints versus anti-c5, and i'll go through that in a bit more detail. lastly, on an esg front, we had an important announcement with respect to our work with the medicines patent pool as well as additional important milestones for two development programs with hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease as well as in malaria. moving to the next slide. the performance in the quarter was really driven by entresto, kesimpta, kigali, and pluvicto.
and you can see the growth here for each of these brands. entresto continues its strong trajectory. kesimpta and kisqali, performing well. and pluvicto in its first full quarter in the launch, also performing very well in its early days.
we also saw good performance across some of the other brands, and we'll come to that brand by brand in the upcoming section. moving to slide 6. one important element of our story is our ability to make our 6 key in-market growth drivers into multibillion-dollar medicines. and we stayed on track with respect to that to really continue our confidence in our midterm growth outlook.
those six brands now account for 33% of im sales, and they were growing 23% in the quarter. and as noted, both scemblix and pluvicto now are off to a good start and could one day be added to that list of six brands to also be potential multibillion-dollar brands in the future, depending on how readouts go in the earlier lines. moving to the next slide. now we'll just take a walk through each of the individual brands, and i'll give you some of the key highlights from the quarter.
cosentyx showed steady growth in the quarter. you can see 7% growth in quarter 3. we were maintaining our competitive position in our three core geographies. we have over 875,000 patients now treated.
in the u.s., we saw solid volume growth, but we also saw the impact of increased revenue deductions, particularly in medicaid and 340b segments relative to a previous uplift we saw in revenue deductions in the previous year. that's something we'll expect to continue in quarter 4. now with respect to europe, we maintain our leadership position among originator biologics in psoriasis and spondyloarthritis. future growth drivers for cosentyx to get to that $7 billion peak sales will be driven by our continued expansion in china.
notably, in china at the moment, we do face headwinds with the ongoing lockdowns, but we continue to expect china to be an important part of our story. hidradenitis suppurativa has now been submitted, filed in both fda and ema. i'll tell you a little bit more about why we feel like we have a good opportunity with this indication. we expect to submit our iv regulatory file in quarter 4.
and we also continue to advance our life cycle management program across additional indications, including giant cell arteritis where we saw pretty solid phase 2b data. now moving to slide 8. entresto continues strongly across all geographies, 31% growth in the quarter. you can see here the weekly trx has continued to set record after record, really strong performance in the u.s., but also around the world.
we now have over 8 million patients on therapy. accelerating momentum in the u.s., strong demand in europe. when you look at the future growth drivers of the brand, it's worth noting that only a third of eligible hfref patients are currently on treatment in the g7. and there's a strong profile we continue to build in clinical and real real-world settings in heart failure.
we have guidelines that continue to support the use of entresto and hfref and also support its use in hfpef. and we're also seeing good demand from the hypertension indications we were able to secure in japan and in china. now moving to slide 9. zolgensma had a little bit of a challenged quarter.
we now are predominantly seeing -- we're seeing demand from the incident population. both u.s. and ex u.s. have shifted to an incident patient population.
year-to-date, we still have double-digit growth in incident patients treated, and we've exceeded 2,500 patients treated worldwide. going forward, what will be key for us is to continue to expand into new markets. it's a foundational treatment, as you all know, for type 1 in newborns. we are approved in 45 countries, and we have access negotiations ongoing now in 10-plus markets, including some important markets as brazil.
we also continue to work to increase newborn screening rates to above 35% in europe and hopefully get over time to the rates that we see in the u.s., where we're close to 98% of newborn screen. taken together, we expect zolgensma to -- we continue to expect zolgensma to reach the $1.5 billion to $2 billion sales level in the iv indication alone. but getting beyond that sales level will require expansion into the intrathecal indication in the 2 to 18-year-old patient segment where the steer study is continuing to enroll and we also have the strength study looking at the iv utilization in that indication starting in q4 2022. now moving to slide 10 kisqali had a really strong quarter across all regions, with 49% growth on the quarter.
you can see, importantly, in the middle panel of the slide, the trend break we've had with respect to nbrx share in the u.s. in the metastatic population, where we've been able to climb over the course of this year from 12% to 13% to now 26% exiting in august. that's really on the back of the strong data that we have with respect to os across all of the metastatic lines. it's the only cdk4/6 with overall survival benefit across three phase 3 studies.
we also have a strong data with respect to quality of life. we've launched a head-to-head study, the harmonia study versus ibrance to further solidify that profile. and the natalee study continues. we have not had any feedback yet from the steering committee with respect to the first interim analysis.
and when that feedback becomes available, if it indicates any action on our part, we'll, of course, inform the market. moving to slide 11. now kesimpta had strong sales growth as well in the quarter, driven by its u.s. launch momentum, 172% you can see here on its launch trajectory.
really, all of the key metrics are trending in a favorable direction. trx, 131%. nbrx, 47% versus a market notably that's declining 20%. we are up to 30% nbrx share in b-cell -- among b-cell therapies in ms in the u.s.
with a goal to reach 50% share. we're adding 100 new writers per month. our initiation programs with our patient hub are performing extremely well. and we also released new four-year data in recently diagnosed and treatment-naive kesimpta patients that support its use in earlier stages in rms disease.
so really good trajectory here and an opportunity for us now to also accelerate our efforts outside of the united states to bring this medicine to more multiple sclerosis patients around the world. now moving to the next slide. now with leqvio, as we've noted, this is a steady build over the course of 2023 and the first half of 2024. last quarter, we highlighted that we have good data or good positioning right now with respect to market access with 70% of lives covered at or near the full label.
the vast majority of patients are able to access the medicine with a low co-pay. and now what we're doing is step-by-step expanding hcp adoption with now 4,800 or so physicians that have been able to initiate a patient on leqvio. what is critical now for us is to guide these physicians through the process so that they're able to get their patients on board, they're able to see how buy and bill work. and importantly, they're also able to see the impact of the medicine on lowering ldl for their patients.
what we find is in physicians that have gone through that process and have ultimately seen the impact on their patients, over 80% of patient -- physicians are pleased by the process and are pleased by the clinical and safety profile of the medicine. we just need to get more physicians through that process. so you can see some of the other data on the right-hand side. we have a free trial offer as well that's launched has seen strong uptake.
so we'll continue to work through the hurdle step by step. i think the right things are happening. but again, this is going to take time. and we really think it's midyear next year before you would expect to see any further acceleration beyond the linear path that we're on at the moment.
now moving to the next slide. pluvicto, as i noted in my opening comments, is off to a strong start in the u.s. we're seeing very rapid launch uptake for this brand in the third, fourth-line castrate-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer segment. $80 million in share, we're already up to 14% nbrx share in the post-taxane setting.
we have 120 centers actively ordering, and we're really focused on servicing those centers in an outstanding way. 75% of insured lives are covered, and we have a permanent a code now in effect as of october. now looking ahead, as we prepare for additional data and potential expansion of the indications for this medicine, we're expanding the number of treatment centers. we expect to, over time, get to 350 to 400 centers.
we're significantly increasing our manufacturing capacity. and we have our italian site at ivrea online and millburn and indianapolis are planned for 2023. i mentioned already the positive chmp opinion, and we're on track for the readout of psmafore before the end of this year and psmaaddition. and of note, psmafore, our current assessment is this would cover all pre-taxane metastatic patients, eliminating the need for one of the additional studies we had previously expected to be running in that setting.
and in psmaaddition, in the hormone-sensitive setting, we would expect to read out in 2024. so more to come, but overall, a solid launch so far with pluvicto. now moving to the next slide, looking at scemblix. scemblix, also continuing a solid launch momentum through quarter 3.
you can see $41 million in sales, 13% total overall patient share in the third-line setting, and 39% third-line new patient share. that new patient share growth has slowed a bit, as we would have expected, as we need patients to switch off of therapies that they're currently in line to be typically moved to scemblix. looking ahead, we've had the accelerated approval converted to a regular approval based on 96-week data. the global rollout is ongoing.
and importantly, our phase 3 study is enrolling ahead of plan. right now, we forecast the readout expected on this first [technical difficulty]

please continue to stand by, your conference will resume shortly.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
hi, operator. this is vas, we're back.
operator
thank you, sir. you are live.
samir shah -- global head of investor relations
i think we were trying to [inaudible]
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so i think i'll just step back, operator, to one slide previously. so when i talk about moving to the first line, scemblix, which would be on slide 14. we continue to see strong launch momentum where we have q3 sales driven in part by -- q3 sales were $41 million, and we had a 13% patient share in the third-line setting. nbrx is at 39%.
and overall, we expect scemblix, the critical element now, will be moving forward our ability to move into the earlier line. the study is enrolling ahead of plan, and we'll provide further updates. but right now, we forecast the second half 2024 outlook for scemblix. now turning to some of the clinical data we had in the quarter.
cosentyx, we had previously top-line data, 16-week in hidradenitis suppurativa. now we have the 52-week data in-house. and just to remind everyone that it's a high unmet need patient population, one of the more common dermatological conditions that dermatologists see. 95% of eligible patients are not on a biologic today and 50% of biologic-treated patients lose the response over time.
so there's definitely a need for a better therapy that can sustain its efficacy over time. with the sunrise and sunrise data set, we were able to collect data both at the 16-week and 52-week time period. we've already demonstrated data that showed a rapid relief from pain flares and lesion, but now we have data in-house to suggest that we have a unique benefit to sustain the response over 52 weeks, along with a favorable safety profile. so we look forward to sharing that data.
we have filed, as i mentioned already, with the regulators. and overall, we're hopeful that this can be a key growth driver for cosentyx over the coming years. now moving to the next slide. earlier this week, we announced the release of the iptacopan phase 3 data in pnh, and this is a medicine we believe can become a pipeline in a pill over time with the range of indications we're currently developing the medicine for.
as a reminder, we are in -- we read out the pnh phase 3 with an additional phase 3 upcoming, the appoint-pnh study. we're in phase 3 studies in igan, c3g, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. and we have a range of additional indications currently ongoing. as a reminder, the apply-pnh study related to the treatment of patients who had refractory anemia after treatment with an anti-c5, and the appoint study is in treatment-naive patients to anti-c5 antibodies, also expected to read out in 2022.
now looking on the next slide, slide 17, to the apply-pnh study specifically. this is a study, as i mentioned, patients were on c5 therapy for up to eight weeks. they then switched to -- if they had refractory anemia that demonstrated hemoglobin levels of less than 10 grams per deciliter, they were randomized to either receive iptacopan or an anti-c5 therapy for 24 weeks. and after that period of time, they would continue on iptacopan for the extension period.
we demonstrated superiority for both endpoints, and i would say clinically meaningful superiority on both endpoints in terms of proportion of patients at greater than 2 grams and greater than 12 grams per dl. we have submitted this data or plan to submit this data to an upcoming medical congress, where we would share not only the magnitude of the effect in the primary endpoint but also secondary endpoints, including transfusion independence, quality of life, overall response rate as well as other measures. so moving to the next slide. just as a reminder, our goal with this medicine is to be a first-line therapy for all patients with pnh.
and that is the positioning that we plan to achieve both through our labeling and through the launch process. 10 to 20 cases per million is the current estimate of pnh with a current prevalence in the united states of 4,000 to 6,000. in the population of the current study that we just read out, about 40% of patients remain anemic with hemoglobin less than 10 grams per deciliter on anti-c5 therapies. it's also worth noting that a higher proportion of patients have some level of anemia, some level of fatigue or other clinical manifestations of the disease.
so the unmet need is significant even in the case of anti-c5 treatments. and 50% of patients -- of these patients receive transfusions. we believe iptacopan presents a unique opportunity to address both intra and extravascular hemolysis, potential for lower transfusion requirements and improvements in the quality of life. we think the oral administration in this setting makes a lot of sense, and then we can talk more about that in the q&a.
and we believe that this -- there is a potential for this medicine to have a broad first-line label. moving to the next slide. lastly, before handing it over to harry, sandoz has delivered another solid quarter of growth. and you can see the growth rates here where we once again had a 4% sales growth.
this was driven in part by europe, but particularly by our performance in the rest of world markets where we had double-digit growth. this is the fourth consecutive quarter of solid top-line growth for sandoz despite having to overcome the impact of russia and ukraine and absorbing inflation and other headwinds. we've revised the full-year guidance upwards, and harry will speak more about that. and we want to just remind again that biosimilars are the key future growth driver of the business.
we had the file acceptance of adalimumab high concentration and natalizumab in the quarter as well as a positive phase 3 result for denosumab as well on the biosimilars unit. so with that, i will -- and we're on track, i should say, as well for the planned spin in the second half of next year. so with that, i'll hand it over to harry.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, vas. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. i'm now going to walk you through some of the financials for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.
and as always, my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies. this is, of course, particularly important given the significant currency fluctuations we all see, and so we believe it offers a better view of the underlying operational performance. on slide 21, this shows the usual summary of our operational performance for the third quarter and the first nine months. we have also provided growth rates with and without the impact of the prior year roche income to allow a better understanding of the underlying business.
as you can see, we maintained our growth momentum in the quarter, with quarter 3 sales growing plus 4% and core operating income plus 5%, with sales growth driven by our major innovative medicines brands, in particular entresto, kesimpta, and kisqali. higher sales were also reflected in higher core operating income growth and inflationary headwinds have been offset by productivity efforts. operating and net income declined in the quarter, mainly due to higher impairments of about $0.5 billion and higher restructuring costs of about $0.4 billion versus prior year which were mainly due to the implementation of our previously announced streamlined organizational model. core eps grew 1%.
however, if you exclude the impact of the prior-year roche income, core eps would have grown 10%. free cash flow in the quarter was strong with $4.2 billion, but declined 6% in u.s. dollars versus prior year with a significant impact from currencies. turning to the first nine months.
we delivered a slightly stronger growth year to date, with sales growing 5% and core operating income growing 6%. core eps in the first nine months grew 11%, excluding the roche stake impact. on the next slide, i would like to drill down, as usual, into the performance by division. so for q3 innovative medicines top line grew 4%, and the bottom line, 7%, resulting in an improvement of the core margin of 100 basis points to 38.1%.
sandoz net sales also grew 4%, although core operating income decreased 5%, mainly due to increased m&s investments versus a quite low prior year base and prior year small divestment gains. this was reflected in the core margin, which decreased to approximately 22% of sales which is also in line with the year-to-date core margin for sandoz. overall, for the first nine months, we saw a slightly stronger sales performance for both divisions. im sales grew 5% and core operating income, 6%.
and for sandoz, sales grew 6% and 5% on the bottom line, benefiting from a strong cough and cold season, return toward normal business dynamics and a low prior year base in the first half of the year. our year-to-date core margin improved by 50 basis points for im, which drove then also the 50 basis points improvement for the group. now on to slide 23. on the next slide, a reminder of the cost impacts of our simplified organizational model.
we continue to expect to deliver usd 1.5 billion in structural cost savings to be fully embedded by 2024. and as a reminder, we also expect onetime restructuring costs to be 1 to 1.2 times this annual structural savings. and for year to date this year, we have around $0.8 billion in restructuring costs related to the new streamlined model and expect approximately a total of $1 billion for the full year of restructuring costs on this topic. the rest of the onetime restructuring costs we anticipate will largely fall into 2023.
this year, we do expect to see some savings. as you can see here illustrative on the chart. but the overall impact will be minimal as this will offset higher energy cost inflationary pressures. all of these elements are, of course, part of our 2022 guidance.
as a reminder, part of the $1.5 billion savings we expect to be reinvested into our pipeline and a significant part will contribute to achieve our approximately 40% plus margin target in the 2027 plus time frame. now turning to page 24. within the divisions, we expect innovative medicine sales growing mid-single digit and core operating income growing mid- to high single digits ahead of sales. the anticipated innovative medicines' core margin increase should be driven by the expected continued good top-line momentum and the continuation of our productivity programs, including the new streamlined organization model.
for sandoz, the performance year to date allows us to upgrade sales and core operating income guidance, and sales are now expected to grow low to mid-single digit, revised upward from low single digit. and core operating income is now expected to grow low single digit, revised upward from broadly in line. for the group, we confirm our overall guidance. we continue to expect both top and bottom line to grow mid-single digit in 2022.
and as you have seen from our year-to-date results, we are quite on track -- very much on track to deliver on that guidance. the key assumption for this guidance is that we see continuing return to normal global prescribing behavior and healthcare systems and no sandostatin lar generics would enter in the u.s. in 2022. the guidance also takes into account the entry of gilenya that have now launched in the u.s.
for your information, gilenya u.s. sales in quarter 3 were $326 million. on slide 25, i would like to provide an update on the other key financial elements of our expected core net income performance. as indicated on the q2 call, we expect core net financial expenses to be slightly lower than in 2021, around $100 million to $150 million favorable versus 2021, revised from broadly in line versus 2021.
and this change is mainly due to the higher financial income from reinvesting the proceeds of the roche divestment and increased interest income for deposits. and the 2022 core tax rate is now expected to be around 16.5%, revised from the 17% to 17.5% range. this is mainly driven by a favorable change in the geographical profit mix. on slide 26, i want to provide an update on expected currency impacts if currencies stay at current levels.
obviously, currency impacts are significant this year given the strength in u.s. dollar against many, if not all, currencies. for quarter 4, if currencies stay as they are now, we expect sales to be impacted by negative 9% and core operating income by negative 11% points. for the full year, we estimate the impact on the top line to be negative seven points, on the bottom line, negative 8 points.
now into '23, we would expect the sales to be impacted by negative 4% and the bottom line negative 5% versus 2022. as a reminder, as currencies move quite dynamically, we update currency impacts every month on our website. and with that, i hand back to vas.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thank you, harry. so moving to slide 28. just as a reminder, at our recent meet the management, we articulated our new novartis strategy, high-value medicines, greatest disease burdens through technology, leadership in r&d and novel access approaches, a focused therapeutic area mindset across five core therapeutic areas, two plus three technology platforms in four priority geographies and a renewed focus on high-value medicines, not necessarily volume of medicines, but delivering truly high-value medicines, along with the other elements of our strategy on delivering returns and strengthening the foundation. and translating that into this year's priorities on to slide 29.
we continue to maintain our growth momentum, and we confirm our 2022 guidance. our top 22 priorities remain on track across launches and growth momentum on our six key brands. the pipeline is progressing per plan. i think the focused strategy, as i mentioned, has been executed against, and we're on track with the spin of sandoz planned for next year.
we continue our productivity plans through our new organizational model, delivering $1.5 billion of additional savings. and we continue to strengthen the foundations of the company, culture driving performance, data science to drive value and working toward esg leadership. so with that, i will open the line for questions. [operator instructions] thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] we will now take our first question. and your first question comes from graham parry from bank of america.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so it's on pluvicto. so very strong launch. obviously, that's not inventory because you can't build inventory on pluvicto. so i was wondering actually, has this caused any capacity constraints given you're only supplying from the italian facility at the moment? and therefore, could we expect actually sales to flat [inaudible] quarter until you see new capacity come online? if you could just give us an update on the timing of the new jersey and indianapolis plants next year, are they still second quarter and the second half? anything you can do to bring those online faster?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, graham. so with respect to pluvicto, we're able to supply the u.s. demand across the 150 -- 125-plus centers now we have currently set up.
and we would expect demand growth to continue in quarter 4. so we're able to make that supply. what's critical for us is as we move into the period where we hope to have a positive readout in the earlier lines of the sma4 study, we would need additional capacity to be able to service that earlier, large indication. right now, we hope to be able to file the millburn facility back to the pluvicto file before the end of this year.
and hope to have that online in the first part of next year. and we're on track for the indianapolis facility to come online in the middle of next year. so once the millburn facility comes online, we've invested in that facility, we have additional capacity, we would be well positioned already for that new indication and the demand surge. and then once indianapolis comes online, we would be in a position where we can service the u.s.
from two manufacturing plants in the u.s., dedicate our european facilities to europe and ex u.s., and then look at adding additional capacity in asia and other markets over time. thank you, graham.
operator
your next question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein.
wimal kapadia -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
can i just ask about zolgensma, please. so some of your commentary, vas, now suggests you've penetrated a large part of the bolus pool and it's really about the incident population moving forward. i think it's probably fair to say, or please correct me, it's not that previously the $2 billion peak sales guide ex the intrathecal was a fair estimate. that's now saying $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
so i just want to be clear, is that a change in expectations? and particularly given we're going to get close to $1.5 billion this year alone. and then just maybe, you mentioned brazil. which are the key countries and maybe some timing on those countries would be great.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. so the dynamics on zolgensma, as you all well know, we just to go through them, is that we -- as we add markets, we initially penetrate a bolus of patients in the under two age group, and then we move back to the incident patient population. and in the incident patient population, the demand is driven by expanding newborn screening, particularly outside of the united states. right now, the key for us is to add those additional markets.
so those markets range from saudi arabia and brazil to turkey and india. so there's a number of markets and other markets around the world where we're currently in active negotiation. and our hope is by adding those markets online, we'll be able to build that overall pool, not only of prevalent patients which will increase sales for a period of time, but also build up the base of incident patients who are receiving zolgensma on an ongoing basis. i think as we now look at the trajectory, we're ranging just because we -- it's hard for us to predict exactly as we learn more when exactly these markets will come online.
so we think it's prudent to say 1.5 to 2. we certainly have the aspiration to get to two, but it's going to depend on how many more markets we're actually able to get on to national programs. and of course, our teams are working very hard to do that. we're currently enrolling the intrathecal indication for a 2 to 18-year olds, as i mentioned, both to generate additional data for iv, where we do have a broader label in certain markets including the eu, up to five years of age.
we want to generate additional data for the iv and the pivotal study and 2 to 18 year olds. and we remain on track. we hope to have that filing in 2024 and then approved in the first part of 2025. and that would give us the momentum to make the medicine beyond $2 billion over time.
and i think we'll have a better sense of how large it could be depending on the magnitude of the effect we see in those indications. thanks for the question, wimal.
operator
your next question comes from the line of richard parkes, bnp paribas.
richard parkes -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
just a question on iptacopan in pnh. you've outlined the data for us on measures of extravascular hemolysis, but i wondered if you could give us any indication on how data on measures of intravascular hemolysis, such as ldh and rated breakthrough hemolysis were trending. i know you'll present the data, but just wondering if you've got confidence there's at least no deterioration in those measures when switching from standard of care. and maybe you could just give us a sense of how you think about the launch uptake in that indication given we have standard of care with long-term outcomes data beyond control of anemia.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, richard. so first, i think it's worth remembering that in phase 2b as -- in the phase 2b data sets for iptacopan, iptacopan demonstrated strong ldh lowering and a very favorable safety profile also with respect to breakthrough hemolysis. given that we are in the midst of filing this data or submitting this data for congresses, i don't want to [inaudible] update on the secondary endpoints.
we'll present all of that as soon as possible in an upcoming medical meeting. but we feel very confident about the overall safety profile of iptacopan with respect to the various other elements that one would want to measure across intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. importantly as well, what will be important is an upcoming data set as in the frontline setting in treatment-naive patients to demonstrate that the profile holds up. taken together, based on everything that we've seen thus far, we -- our aspiration remains to be a medicine that can be used in naive patients, in patients -- to switch patients off of anti-c5s on to what we believe could be a more beneficial therapy.
and then if desired, it can also be used as an add-on therapy to really cover the full range of potential indications with this medicine, a twice-a-day oral medicine, that we think can be really an attractive option, not only in the u.s., but also when you consider that half of the pnh market is currently an ex u.s. market, a two-day oral could be highly, highly attractive. so all things to work through. we look forward to presenting the data in more detail shortly.
thanks, richard.
operator
your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank.
emmanuel papadakis -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perhaps i could take one on leqvio. we don't seem to see much of an impact from the first of july j-code award. so just your latest perspective on how things are trending and what confidence on what actually drives that mid-'23 inflection? is there something that in your view is going to capitalize a step change in the middle of next year? or is it more really a build through the course of 2023 and your confidence that will still get to blockbuster status pre-outcomes data in '26?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, emmanuel. the key here is to get enough physicians who have gone through the process of getting a patient on therapy, both then seeing the ldl reduction after the first and second dose, second dose is at the three-month time point, and having successfully been reimbursed in the part b program. when those things happen, we see physicians, 80% plus of physicians, at least that we've internally surveyed, have a positive experience, both from a clinical standpoint and from a part b reimbursement standpoint, regardless of whether they used an alternative injection center or used their own clinic. so that's all the positive data that we have, but we need to move physicians through that process.
so the reason we highlight 4,000 physicians now have initiated shows that we have that kind of -- in the early part of the funnel physicians moving through the process, they probably trialed a few patients. we now had to get them through that entire process. and if they presumably have that positive overall experience, they will add additional patients on to the therapy. and so this is going to be a build.
but as we build that base, we hope then to convert entire practices over to using leqvio over time. and that would hopefully then lead to a compounding effect and an acceleration. overall, we remain confident that we will get to the blockbuster status ahead of outcomes data, that's for certain. and a lot of work to do, but it absolutely remains our goal.
thank you, emmanuel.
operator
your next question comes from the line of matthew weston, credit suisse.
matthew weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
i got a follow on with emmanuel's question, again touching on leqvio. so vas, as you pointed out, the market inflection not until 18 months into launch. as i recall, going back to diovan and entresto, i thought they took four years to break even as products. and now we have the risk of the ira potentially limiting small molecule life to nine years.
can you just lay out whether or not you feel that leqvio will break even before that four-year level we saw with large cardiovascular medicines? and if so, why? and then i guess the other question is whether having invested so heavily in buy and bill, are there other cardiovascular assets that you hope to bring on board or have in the pipeline that you can put through the similar channel to give doctors the comfort that investing in all the practice infrastructure isn't just a single product with leqvio, but there's a stream of products that they can capitalize on.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, matthew. so first, on the payback period, i'll have harry comment, and i'll come back on the second part of your question.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
matthew, i think we -- as we discussed before, these cardiovascular launches, in my experience, like gp primary care launches, and of course all of them are different depending on the product and the category and so on, but in my experience, usually then the breakeven happens roughly in year 4 plus/minus. while, of course, high-priced specialty launches sometimes have a breakeven in year 1 or at least in year 2. so clearly, nine years versus 13 years is not a positive, right? that's why i think also there will be initiatives to move those closer to the 13 years, both of them. but at the moment, it's nine years.
but of course, in any of these launches, one wants to have the uptake to be as fast as possible, just cardiovascular is slow. and i would expect the usually breakeven in year 4.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
i think, matthew, in terms of having -- it is on our mind to build a broader portfolio of medicines. so both in-house, we have efforts ongoing both in terms of life cycle management of leqvio as well as other novel therapeutics which are still moving through the research pathway or research labs to try to accelerate now to make sure we have a stream of medicines. i also say broadly in the industry, there are other medicines as well that i think would also fit in terms -- into the buy-and-bill model. but on a stand-alone basis, for most practices that we've analyzed, the number of cholesterol patients in a practice, it is favorable for cardiologists once they have the setup and have it moving to do it just for leqvio.
so i think it's an important point that it's not a requirement that you have multiple medicines. even this one medicine alone, where you have also the certainty that you know the patient is on therapy, you see the result on the cholesterol lowering. it's highly attractive from that point clinically. and also the practice has the cost reimbursement elements as well.
it's pretty attractive, we find with most practices that have gone through the process. so we'll not only focus on leqvio, but also build a pipeline behind it. and as harry mentioned, i think a top priority has to be to ensure small molecules and related technologies are not penalized relative to large molecules. so that, of course, will take time to shape public policy.
thanks, matthew.
operator
your next question comes from the line of simon baker of redburn.
simon baker -- redburn partners -- analyst
and the risk of being boring, i'm going to follow matthew and emmanuel on leqvio. vas, just on this -- your expectation of a linear trend to the middle of next year, with the two drivers of more doctors being set up to administer the drug and more patients per physician, i mean that does sound a little conservative because, i mean, that in itself should -- if both of those are increasing, that should drive more than linear growth. so i'm just trying to understand a little bit more about that. and also related to that, you are running a dtc campaign with two adverts at the moment in the u.s.
for leqvio. do you have any sense of how patient demand is exceeding the billing capabilities of physicians at the moment? it's not the case of unfilled scripts, but unsatisfied patient demand. is there any indication you can give us on that?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes, simon. i think on the first question, i think it's just -- we've learned over the years, it's prudent on cardiovascular launches to be appropriately cautious until we see evidence that in the sales line, we see a trend break. and i think at the moment, all of the inputs look positive, as you say. we have the number of physicians that we have that have initiated some action on leqvio, the feedback we get from physicians going through the process.
we're starting to see improvements, so we'd like to see more improvements in depth per practice that are on that are using leqvio already. so all of the things are in the right direction reimbursement is at higher levels than pcsk9s achieved in year 5. we've said high levels of patients don't have to pay any co-pay to access the medicine. so again, all in the right direction.
but i think we would feel better if we actually saw a trend break before we start promising anything bigger than a linear trend. so that's kind of our mindset at the moment. and if it happens, that would be terrific and we, of course, share that with all of you as soon as it does. we do have a very active dtc campaign to activate patients on the benefits of a twice-a-year therapy that can deliver up to 60% lowering on ldl cholesterol.
we do see the beginnings of increased patient demand. i would note that, actually, we don't see capacity as an issue because we are able to use the aic networks, which are continuing to expand to absorb any excess patient volume. so if a practice is not able to set a buy and bill immediately, we're able to educate practices about aics, which are available in the community that are set up. and we've worked very closely with that expanding network of alternative injection centers to make leqvio available.
one of the things we've learned that we need to get much smoother at is that transition of helping a practice that sent the patient to the aic and then back to the practice. we're working on smoothing that out. but that aic creates a pretty big surge capacity. but what we do hear from practices in general is, over time, they would like to set up the buy-and-build capacity within their own practice.
it's just a matter of can they do that immediately? or would they like to do that in the future? thanks, simon.

your next question comes from the line of tim anderson, wolfe research.
richard wagner -- wolfe research -- analyst
this is richard wagner on behalf of tim with wolfe research. it's about cosentyx. and could we get an update on the competitive landscape in the u.s. as abbvie works to lock in formulary positioning for its various i&i products in 2023 onwards as humira biosimilars approach.
what would be the impact or could be the impact on net pricing and formulary placement?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, richard. when you look at cosentyx, we're still in the midst of the formulary negotiations at this time. but our best belief in indication, given that formularies want to have an il-17a available for patients, that we'll be able to maintain our formulary position at roughly equivalent position in terms of our gross to net as we have this year.
i think looking forward, what will be absolutely critical for us to continue cosentyx's growth dynamics and really maximize the medicine is the approval of additional indications in hidradenitis. we have the iv indication as well. as i mentioned, we plan to file -- we have a 2 ml syringe, which we're also in the midst of filing. those would be the next big three.
and then beyond that, indications, as i mentioned, giant cell arteritis, tendinitis, among others. that's going to be the next wave we're going to need to maintain strong position on formularies, but also to enable the brand to continue to grow. but for 2023, based on our negotiations to date and reviews we've had with our managed market teams, we feel comfortable with where we'll be on formularies for next year.

your next question comes from the line of stephen scala from cowen.
stephen scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
first, an observation than a question. so the observation is that in response to the pluvicto question, it makes it sound as though q4 sales will be appreciably above q3. and i guess you must have some visibility since q4 is about a third over already. the question is, vas, in the past, you have been cautious on the use of a-beta antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease.
given recent news, do you have any reason to change your view? and if yes, then how will novartis gain a position in a-beta antibodies or some other approach in alzheimer's?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve. on the a-beta antibodies, i think what's most important, particularly given the amount of investment that would need to be made by healthcare systems for therapies, and we of course are active in alzheimer's disease research, is the benefit that we're seeing not only statistically significant but clinically meaningful. and i think with the various measures that are currently used, it's hard to judge what is clinically meaningful ultimately for a patient.
and i think that's going to be the question for payers, advisors, etc., in the u.s. markets. is this clinically meaningful enough? a very -- the 0.4, 0.45 or whatever the number is, on the adas acog scores. so i think we'll have to see.
that will be for others to judge. our focus is on other mechanisms of action. i mean we think -- we don't know, but certainly, our labs are working on other approaches across the full range of neurodegenerative diseases, where we have programs in the clinic, as you know, on huntington's and parkinson's, and continue to also look at various targets in alzheimer's. but i wouldn't expect us to take any action on a beta, and none of the data that i've seen thus far would trigger us to make a shift at this point in time.

kerry holford -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
question for harry. just looking at the unr844 termination, that product that you acquired by the encore vision acquisition. was there an asset impairment taken in the quarter? and if not, is that coming next quarter? i wonder if you can quantify how big that might be.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, kerry. actually, the majority of our impairment recorded in quarter 3 was unr. the potential presbyopia drops of roughly net impact of $0.5 billion.

your next question comes from the line of richard vosser j.p. morgan.
richard vosser -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
maybe we could talk about natalee. and maybe you could give us an update where we are in terms of the interim analysis. is it still a case that the 70% interim should be expected at the end of the year? and then, of course, the final analysis within the second half of next year? just some thoughts there would be great.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, richard. so we continue to expect the first interim to read out before the end of this year. but we have not heard back from the dmc at this point in time.
and our approach will be that if the dmc advises us to make a change, we'll let the markets know. and if you don't hear from us, that means the dmc told us that the study should continue as planned. we expect the second interim to happen in the first half of next year and the final study should complete at the second half of next year. another study that -- another question that often comes up is related to how we'll approach os in these various settings.
and the fda has confirmed to us that as long as there is no detriment to os at any of these time points, that would be sufficient for them to consider the data set as pivotal for a potential approval. thanks, richard.

your next question comes from the line of emily field from barclays.
emily field -- barclays -- analyst
just on ms. on gilenya, i know your prior guidance assumed no launches in the u.s. so good to maintain that. just the impact on core operating margin, should we think of that as a pretty straight drop-down given that it's probably a pretty high-margin product? and then just on kesimpta, your share assumptions in the class going forward, do you expect those to be impacted by the potential launch of subcutaneous ocrevus?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so first on gilenya, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, emily. yes, this is -- it's a very high gross margin product. there's some royalty on it, but it's, of course, also small molecule, high priced.
so the product margin is quite high. as you can imagine, at the end of the life cycle, there is not much m&s on it. so it's pretty much a straight drop down to the bottom line. but of course, we have mitigating actions and productivity plans, and it's fully embedded in our guidance this year.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
and then with respect to kesimpta, kesimpta has really been successful as a first line for switch medicine in the neurology settings that are not currently participating in infusions, as is the case with our competitor product. i think first, we need to see if a high-dose subcu can be delivered without any sort of reactions and other complications. i don't think that's a given. i mean, of course, data will have to bear that out.
and then it's worth remembering our positioning will be for patients who want a monthly injection at home and don't want to go into the infusion center. clearly, the subcu might reduce the time of the infusion center, but it remains to be seen how will steroid pretreatment need to be happened. will it need to be continued to be iv? is it sufficient for it to be oral? what kind of monitoring requirements fda will require? so i think it still remains that there is a segment of the market that will want to use iv infusion or subcu infusion therapies. and there's a segment where novartis and kesimpta, we hope to become the clear leader among patients first class -- first treatment or first switch who want a very convenient, at-home, highly safe, high efficacious b-cell therapy, and that's our focus.
and harry has a point.
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. just emily, a follow-on clarification also on gilenya. i mentioned that this is fully in our guidance for 2022. i just want to mention also that this has no impact to our mid- to long-term guidance.
prior to this turn of the u.s. courts, if you will, we were expecting to lose u.s. exclusivity, if you will, or have generic entries in the middle of '24 roughly, right? from that standpoint, our 40% plus margin goal in 2027 plus was already fully assuming that generics would have ended several years before that.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, harry. and so we still have a number of questions in the queue. [operator instructions]

your next question comes from the line of keyur parekh from goldman sachs.
keyur parekh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
vas, you mentioned that you would like for iptacopan to be the therapy of choice kind of in the frontline setting. what data do you think you would need to see kind of from the frontline study to allow for iptacopan to be in that position given the headstart that the alexion products already have in that market?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, keyur. i think what will be important is if we can demonstrate we can generate clear control of the disease. and of course, across the various parameters, ldh, safety, etc., that we have a compelling profile.
i think when you look broadly, first, if you think first principle to biology of this disease, this is an alternative complement pathway-driven disease factor b is a relatively unique component of this in that it's not as abundant as c3 and c5, and an oral agent can get to both to extravascular and intravascular sources of factor b and inhibit those. and those include tissues that go beyond the liver, which is an important consideration when you consider asos and sirnas in oral therapy the unique profile in being able to reach the full broad range of tissues. so overall, we think factor b for these alternative complement-driven diseases, including pnh, is an ideal target. and overall, the pk/pd we see for this medicine, the preclinical and clinical safety we see, has been very good.
that's been borne out now in the apply-pnh study that we've already headlined. and we hope to continue to see that in the frontline study. and then next year in c3g, in particular, but also in igan. and then in other alternative complement pathway-driven diseases, including what's called a gluten disease, mpgn.
so there's a range of diseases where we believe the medicine is well suited. and i think we're excited that the medicine has, so far in its first pivotal readout, borne out the clinical and preclinical hypotheses that we set forward. so we'll look forward to providing the data in an upcoming medical congress as i outlined. and then the second study as well will read out before the end of this year.

your next question comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
first, just returning to natalee, the interim analysis. is that based on all comers? or do you need to see a significant benefit specifically in the intermediate-risk patients, which may be, i guess, as low as 25%, 30% of the events?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. so, mark, i think it's important to note that we're looking at both grade two, grade patients in the study. and the way we're powered is across the entire population. and we've relooked at powering many times now, and we feel very comfortable based on the study design and what we've seen from other competitors and the fact that we power it up by 1,000 additional patients.
and so the results, the idfs results, will be based on the overall population, and that's how the endpoints are designed. as a separate point, and just to be clear, the fda, can, at any point in time, decide that they want to take cuts between stage two and stage three patients. but our focus for our primary analysis is stage 2, stage 2 and stage 3 patients as defined in the protocol, and the endpoint will be driven off of that entire patient population.
operator
your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez, guggenheim securities.
seamus fernandez -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
i guess one quick question just on leqvio. can you just help us understand where those patients are coming from? are they predominantly switched patients from existing pcsk9 therapy? or is this a new patient pool? and then just very quickly, second question. vas, as we look toward potential business development becoming increasingly critical as the years progress, just wondering where your particular focus is given the commentary around primary care cardiovascular product launches and the ability to launch into those efficiently.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, seamus. so first, on leqvio [inaudible] business. just as a reminder, the target patient population in the u.s.
is 18 million patients. and across all of the core markets, eu plus the top markets around the world, is around 70 million patients. these are patients who have had a prior cardiovascular event and are not reaching 70 milligrams per deciliter on their ldl score. and that is the guideline directed, that is the goal.
so it's a big, big patient population. right now, i think what we can say is that the primary prescribers that we see are prescribers who also have experience with pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies. that could be low experience, it could be high experience, harder for us to say given that this is a part b medicine, the source of business from a patient standpoint. but i presume then we're either getting switch patients on pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies or we're at least getting a broader share of physicians that are open to the pcsk9 class.
and so our focus right now is to really say how can we get broad adoption within, let's call it, pcsk9-minded physicians. and then over time, try to expand further and further through our work with systems of care, population health agreements, etc., into the broader patient population of 18 million patients. clearly, we don't need that bigger share of that 18 million patients to reach our overall financial goals. from a public health standpoint, we would, of course, want to [inaudible] many of those patients as possible, because right now, the odds of a patient having a subsequent event go up quite dramatically if they're not at that 70 goal.
so that's kind of overall how we approach it. there's no updates with respect to m&a and bd. we continue to focus on, let's call them, sub-$3 billion, $4 billion m&a deal, broad range of licensing opportunities, focused primarily on science and does the science work? is it fitting in our core therapeutic areas? does it fit in our two plus three technology areas as we've outlined at the meet the management. and we continue to assess.
then if we find something that's attractive, where we have a differentiated view that would justify the premium and generate, we believe, value creation for our shareholders, we'll, of course, pursue it. other than that, we're also willing to be patient. we believe in our pipeline. we believe with our new leadership within r&d and the addition of a strategy and growth officer, we can unlock the full potential of novartis research and development and then have a steady stream of medicines going forward.
and so we're going to remain disciplined as we move ahead.

your next question comes from the line of florent cespedes from societe generale.
florent cespedes -- societe generale -- analyst
vas, a quick one on china, please. as china is a key country for you. could you please elaborate on the dynamic there for your key products and if there is any, let's say, impact from lockdowns. and could you refresh our memories and please remind us the current contribution and your ambition on this country.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. with respect -- thanks, florent. for china, we've outlined our aspiration to become a top three player by 2024, which would be a player that exceeds $4 billion in sales in the market. we've had really a record performance in terms of number of approvals over recent years.
and then also moving forward, i think we'll lead the industry as well in terms of nrdl listings. key drivers for us has been our oncology portfolio, entresto, cosentyx, lucentis, among others. now we were growing in the high teens from a sales growth standpoint before the lockdowns. and i think the lockdown -- we continue to grow, but we're growing more in the high single-digit frame at the moment.
and we would expect that to continue until we would see a shift in the overall ability for patients to access medical care in more normal dynamics. that's part of the reason why you see the slowdown in cosentyx that we saw. with entresto, given the strength of our overall performance globally, it doesn't really move the needle on that particular brand. so the key brand where it has an impact is cosentyx and, to a smaller extent, in some of the other brands.
nonetheless, we continue to believe, given that there's over 1 billion patients -- 1 billion people we can serve with our portfolio of medicines, we have to continue to find ways to continue to reach patients in the framework that is currently in place. and then also be ready that if there's a further opening up, to continue to expand our growth in the market. and importantly, we believe leqvio and some of our other medicines, pluvicto, leqvio, among others, could be significant medicines in china over time.

your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
a question on the ira impact on catastrophic coverage and the burden on pbms and managed care. a significant part of kisqali is through the medicare channel. ibrance seems to be available at a much lower price post genericization. to what extent -- to what extent, excuse me, do you see deflation of the price of kisqali within the medicare segment because there'll be preauthorization step [inaudible] within medicare prior to gaining access to kisqali? and do you see any risk of spillover of that, assuming that thesis is correct, to the commercial book of business?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
that's a good question, andrew. i think in general i'd say we're doing a lot of scenario planning on how the ira could impact various brands. and i think certainly on our minds is how the increased exposure of pbms in the catastrophic, how that will get transferred or translated into actions against some of our medicines. i think the key for us to differentiate versus a generic in a class like in the cdk4/6, will be having a broader indication -- set of indications relative to the existing medicine.
so i think that's going to be absolutely critical for us in this class to hopefully have the opportunity to expand into, as i mentioned earlier, stage 2a, stage 2b, and stage 3 patients. otherwise, i think there could certainly be spillover from -- in the metastatic setting if there aren't broad indications for the other 2 players. so we'll have to see how this plays out. i would also say, in general, in some of these cancer classes, such as the cdk4/6, you do see contracting and you do see the opportunity for commercial insurers to get rebates from branded products.
so that would be the, i think, tension there in the system, is they would have to give up their commercial rebates to potentially utilize the generic. so we'll have to see ultimately how all of this plays out. thank you, andrew.
operator
your next question comes from the line of peter welford from jefferies.
peter welford -- jefferies -- analyst
i just wanted to return to pluvicto. i wonder if you could give us any more color at all in the centers that are currently using it. are these generally academic centers? are these generally centers that are using via the radiation oncologist? or is it more nuclear medicine physicians? and particularly with regards to then the diagnostic. just wondering, does it largely use your own local vets? or are you seeing use of other diagnostics before treatment? and is that potentially a source of revenue for you in the future, the diagnostics? or should we think of this as largely a wash for novartis as the focus is on therapy.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, peter. overall, i'd say it's a mix. you have high academic centers.
you also have large-scale centers which are, in the case of prostate cancer, a combination of urology and nuclear medicine working in conjunction with medical oncology. we see that in some very large centers. and then we also see some nuclear radiology as well. that's -- and we generally are focused right now on larger volume centers in this first phase of launch.
i would note that if we were able to open it up even further in terms of the number of centers, we would expect even higher volumes for this medicine given the overall demand that we're seeing. but we're taking it stepwise, making sure we can service this first level of centers absolutely fully. and now we're in the process of adding additional centers step by step. so it's a very different situation than with lutathera, where because of the lower volumes and also neuroendocrine tumors being treated by certain specialists, there's a very relatively limited number of centers that were interested.
whereas here, we have more demand from centers, and then within the centers we're in very high demand that we're seeing at the moment. so those are all the dynamics we're seeing. overall, i would say, from a diagnostic standpoint, there is, of course, a preference for gallium. we do see other pet ligands also used.
we wouldn't view our locum business as a driver for novartis or something that can materially impact. it's kind of -- as you said, kind of a. wash, it's much more about identifying patients. one of the dynamics, however, that's very important to understand, as you think about pluvicto in across all lines of metastatic prostate cancer with the psa for study that still needs to read out, is the broadening use of pet imaging for identifying patients who have an elevated psa and to determine the extent of the metastases for their cancer.
that is a dynamic that works very much in the favor of pluvicto because if you identify these patients through the pet ligand, you're more likely to use a radioligand because you've seen the tumor and now you know the therapy can target what you see. and that, i think, is an important dynamic for the brand in the longer run.

your next question comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein.
wimal kapadia -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you for the second question. vas, you mentioned oral being quite important for iptacopan. so i'm just curious how you think about the issue of adherence with an oral therapy in the real world setting.
and then maybe you could talk here about the potential for breakthrough hemolysis as a result of potentially lower adherence.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, wimal. i mean i think there's a couple of topics that we'll have to work through. so there's always the risk of compliance and how we manage that.
we can certainly share as we have more data the experience we have in clinical -- in the controlled clinical trial setting. and as i mentioned earlier, we're confident in the profile we see with respect to breakthrough hemolysis. i think for many patients, having either regular infusions, weekly infusions, biweekly, subcu infusions, all these are quite burdensome. and at least our experience has been in severe diseases that patients are highly compliant with their oral therapies given that they know these are absolutely critical for their health and well-being.
so we believe that the compliance topic can be handled in an ultrarare population that is extremely well informed about their condition, and of course, we'll take the steps necessary. and that the benefits of what we believe and hope the clinical trial data will ultimately bear out, is improved efficacy, improved safety, improved overall control, improved secondary endpoints to be highlighted in the upcoming disclosures, will motivate patients to want to get on the best therapy for the management of their disease. and that's, i think, the case we'll have to make. alongside that, of course, comes up the question on if you're competing against part b medicines, how will that impact? our assessment is that, in general, most of the hematologists who use this medicine are very low volume with respect given that there's only 4,000 to 6,000 patients in the u.s and that can be managed given that this is likely not a large cost recovery driver for those physicians.
outside of the u.s., we would expect our ability to use an oral therapy to reduce the burden on healthcare systems as well as hopefully reach many of the patients who can't afford the currently approved therapies would allow us to, again, treat the majority, i hope, the majority of patients with these complement-driven diseases, including tnh, over time.

your next question comes from the line of graham parry, bank of america.
graham parry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so just following up again on pluvicto, just to reiterate on steve's point. so are you at capacity now though in q3? or should fourth quarter be higher than third quarter before you bring on next level of supply? and then in the pre-taxane setting, can you help us understand the proportion of patients in that first-line metastatic indication that goes through a large center, such as the ones you're targeting at the moment, versus community oncology and community urology centers? and on that last group, how do you stop them from just using taxane upfront anyway? because if they refer a patient, they'll essentially lose the income from that patient, at least for the treatment portion of the disease. and then just lastly, a question we've had a few times this morning, just why the conservatism in the guidance if innovative medicines is growing mid- to high single digits and sandoz also now growing? you've upgraded sandoz twice now without upgrading the group guidance. so just what's sort of the difference, the bridge between im, mid- to high, and then group guidance [inaudible].
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, graham. first, on supply, to reiterate, we have adequate supply to meet the demand for the post-taxane vision population for pluvicto. we see very high levels of demand, and we expect continued growth of the brand in the coming quarters, in that third, fourth line -- third, fourth line setting.
and we allocate all capacity that is available in our network to the united states launch. if anything, we'll -- if we needed, we would prioritize launches in other markets as to ensure that the u.s. is at full demand. i guess what i was trying to indicate is we -- even with respect to the higher demand and higher volumes, we expect to see in quarter 4 those volumes could be even higher if we were to completely unconstrain the number of centers that would want to bring this medicine on board.
so all on the right trajectory. with respect to the pre-taxane setting, we would roughly expect the new data, if positive, to triple to quadruple the number of patients that would be eligible for -- so basically the broad range of patients in the metastatic setting, first, second, third line, but the full range of metastatic prostate cancer patients who have the key constrainer who have a pet scan. so once they have a pet scan, we would expect them to be eligible for our medicine. i think it's much more of pet scan availability that will drive a lot of the movement toward radioligand therapy perhaps versus taxanes or other available therapeutics.
and i guess what i'd say is it's really going to be in terms of referral patterns from community oncology to larger centers. two dynamics there. one, how fast can we move out, because we believe that if we get to 400 or so centers, we can cover the full range of the population, the acceptability would be there. and then second, the quality of the data, so that physicians feel compelled to refer even if there's a risk that the patient has moved to another center.
i think, in general, oncologists want what's best for their patients in all cases. and so i think that's going to be the other part of the story. for more specific data, let us come back to you. we have to probably do some more work in terms of the specifics of community oncology versus large-scale centers and where the patients are in that broad metastatic population.
in terms of the guidance, harry?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
graham, i was expecting that question, of course. but i would say we are guiding for the total company mid-single-digit top line and bottom line on our core sales and core bank. we have delivered on the company for the first 9 months 5% and 6%. and i expect, without getting into a very detailed quarter 4 guidance, that we are roughly in that range again in quarter 4.
but of course, you have to take into account that u.s. gilenya now has a generic entry, so maybe the top line a little bit less than the year to date, but a good mid- to high single digit on the bottom line. so overall, i think you see on the first nine months that we are very much on track for the guidance. if it's a little bit stronger on the bottom line, so be it.
but i think it is roughly in line with what you have seen so far.
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
thanks, graham.

your next question comes from line of matthew weston, credit suisse.
matthew weston -- credit suisse -- analyst
it's a simple question for harry on tax. obviously, you've changed guidance for full year '22 with a reduced tax rate and you highlighted the change in geographic mix. harry, i wondered if that new lower tax rate is the best indication for 2023 or whether or not you see any meaningful changes that mean it's not a good indicator for the midterm?
harry kirsch -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, matthew. so overall, there is always a bit of volatility on geographic profit mix. then we adjust, if you will, to each quarter to what we believe is our full-year estimate on the core and reported taxes.
so basically, we moved our full-year estimate from 16.9%, as we had in the first 6 months, to 16.5%. now i would -- again, we give detailed guidance, of course, for '23 then when we have our full-year results in january or early february actually. and then -- but i would expect the tax rate to be in that range of 16.5% to 17.5%. we will update you with that then early february.

your next question comes from the line of kerry holford, berenberg.
kerry holford -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
a follow-up question on pluvicto. just looking at slide 33, it highlights a change to your approach in metastatic setting. so could you confirm why you're now moving to start phase 2 next year rather than a phase 3 this year? can you just clarify those changes and perhaps the opportunity in that setting as well, please?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, kerry. in the non-metastatic setting, the way our previous study was designed and based on feedback from the various investigators and the fda, we believe the psma4 study covers the population that we had previously believed we needed to do an additional study for. so we redesigned our program to generate additional data in a different -- i don't have the detail at hand, but a different population within the non-metastatic setting.
i would also say we're evaluating now pluvicto as well in earlier lines of therapy to see if we can delay progression as well as evaluating combination therapies as well given the overall interest we've seen on the medicine and the clinical profile that we're seeing. so that's the reason we made that switch, based on the understanding from the regulators and experts in the united states.

when i look at the latest prescriptions for tafinlar mekinist, they seem to have gone more into a decline in q4. is there anything that we should think about in terms of the dynamics you're seeing in the melanoma market, perhaps likely approval impacting those two brands that we should not think of the strong growth we've seen thus far continuing beyond for the brand?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley.
mark purcell -- morgan stanley -- analyst
vas, could you help us understand the scope of the free trial offer on leqvio when it comes to patient initiation and what -- and how that might influence increase in acp adoption? and then secondly, on the interest of loe in china, what's the latest situation there in terms of your best guess?
vas narasimhan -- chief executive officer
so on the pretrial offer, really, the idea was to -- while we already provide payment terms that allow physicians to stock doses and have time to get reimbursed before they would have to ultimately pay for the doses, we also noted that for some physicians, there was a need to provide an alternative option to get them comfortable to start to stop the medicine. so in july, we rolled out a free trial offer program that provides a dose -- first dose for a patient free and then -- so the physician can get comfortable, use those doses and then hopefully then pull through to follow, keep the patient on therapy as they also get comfortable with the buy and bill process. we've had a very strong uptake of that program. and so i think over 1,000 physicians plus have signed up for the free trial offer program at the last look, which was still a month ago.
so that's been a very positive step, i think, to get more physicians to stock leqvio in the offices so that ultimately they can provide it to patients and then hopefully get more comfortable with an ongoing procedure to start the medicine, provide the medicine and get reimbursement. now with respect to entresto in china, we currently are continuing our discussions with the -- our, i guess, our litigations with the -- in china against the various generics. i mean at this point in time, we would expect entresto to be fully on -- protected through '23 and '24 and then impacts in '25 and beyond. but that's something we'll have to continue to look at because it's an evolving landscape with respect to data protection and the ongoing litigations that we have in the country.
so we'll keep you updated accordingly. and i believe with that, we've cleared the entire question queue. i want to thank everyone, and apologies for the two technical disruptions. and we'll look forward to keep you up to date over the course of the remainder of this year.
