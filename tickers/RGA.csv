good day, and welcome to the reinsurance group of america first-quarter 2020 results conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to introduce mr. todd larson, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer.
please go ahead.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. good morning, everyone, and welcome to rga's first-quarter 2020 conference call and our first working-from-home conference call. with me this morning on the call is anna manning, rga's president and chief executive officer; alain n√©emeh, chief operating officer; leslie barbi, chief investment officer; jonathan porter, our chief risk officer; and jeff hopson, the head of our investor relations. considering the unprecedented environment, we have included additional members of our management team on the call and made available an earnings presentation supplement this quarter, which we will be referring to during the call to provide more information on our investment portfolio and our global mortality exposures, among other things.
we will discuss the first-quarter results after a quick reminder about forward-looking information and non-gaap financial measures. following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking information and statements. actual results could differ materially from expected results.
please refer to the earnings release we issued yesterday for a list of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. additionally, during the course of this call, information we provide may include non-gaap financial measures. please see our earnings release, earnings presentation, quarterly financial supplement and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to gaap measures. and now i'll turn the call over to anna for her comments. 
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, todd. good morning, everyone. these are extremely challenging times for all of us, and particularly for those who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. our thoughts are with them and with all of those on the front lines of this crisis who are bearing a disproportionate share of the burden.
at rga, we are focused on supporting our employees, our clients and our communities, knowing that families around the world rely on the financial support that insurance companies provide in times like these. and rga remains committed to helping our clients meet our shared responsibilities to those families. rga is also supporting covid-19 global response efforts through grants from the rga foundation. like others, we have been operating with most of our employees working from home.
i am pleased to report that our operations are functioning normally. the rga teams have risen to the challenge of working remotely, and we are very proud of what they have accomplished. although there remain many unknowns, rga entered the pandemic in a position of strength. we have a strong balance sheet.
our investment portfolio is defensively positioned. we have ample liquidity and an excess capital position of approximately $700 million. we have a resilient global operating platform, a business that is well diversified by geographies, product and risk, a leading brand and a strong track record of success. in short, i believe we have the best life and health team in the global reinsurance industry, and i'm confident that this team will manage through challenges ahead and come out strong.
moving to our first quarter. our operating results were below expectations as we reported adjusted operating eps of $1.41 for the quarter, compared to $2.61 a year ago. we also reported a net gaap loss of $1.41 per share, which in part reflects the accounting treatment for a number of items that are directly attributable to the turmoil in the financial markets. todd will provide a more comprehensive commentary on these elements, but i would note that as financial markets stabilize, we would expect to see a reversal of some of those items over time.
in the quarter, the two biggest sources of negative variance in our operating results were our elevated u.s. individual mortality claims and very low levels of variable investment income. elevated claims in our u.s. individual mortality business were largely the result of a higher-than-expected frequency of smaller claims, even after adjusting for normal seasonality and the impact of the leap day this year.
as discussed at our recent investor day, the impact of seasonality has increased in recent years as our block ages, which impacts the pattern of earnings emergence throughout the year. the excess claim impact was highly concentrated at ages 70 and above. and as briefly outlined in our earnings release and earnings presentation, while cause of death and definitive covid-19 impacts are difficult to establish, especially in the early days of the pandemic, we believe that some of these additional claims might have been directly or indirectly related to covid-19. on the positive side, most of our other segments and businesses performed well in the quarter, including the traditional segments in canada and emea, asia financial solutions business, our u.s.
group business, and our australia business performed better than expected and produced a modest profit. throughout the quarter, we continued to support our clients and executed on several in-force transactions, deploying $55 million in capital. the pipeline remains very good across all our major regions and product lines. going forward, you can expect that we will continue to execute on attractive transactions following our disciplined approach of pursuing those that best align with our capabilities and advantages.
let me comment on covid-19 more broadly. as we work our way through this pandemic, we do expect to see additional covid-19 claims, as well as claims from other causes of death that are accelerated or exacerbated by the pandemic. while the ultimate level and timing of claims was difficult to predict, we believe that our financial strength positions us well through a wide range of potential stress scenarios. our chief risk officer, jonathan porter, will provide more in-depth comments later in this call.
we recognize that we are in unprecedented times and that there are a range of uncertainties that will play out over time, including economic effects and societal changes. through this, we will likely see some ongoing financial impacts, but believe that the effects are manageable given our strong financial position and the demonstrated ongoing earnings power of our global business. rga's talented teams give me confidence that we will manage through the challenges ahead of us and that we can deliver on our promises of creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. thank you for your interest in rga, and i hope you all remain safe and well.
and with that, i'll hand it back to todd to provide more detail on our results.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, anna. i'll review the financial results and discuss rga's capital and liquidity. reported premium growth was 3% for the quarter, but our organic growth on a constant-currency basis was 5%. while that is down from the 6% to 8% that we have been producing more recently, we view the 5% as attractive given the current slowdown in growth in asia pacific.
as anna mentioned, we deployed approximately $55 million of capital into transactions this quarter. the transactions we completed were diverse, both by product and by region. earlier in the quarter, we repurchased $153 million of common stock. we have since suspended share buybacks.
we ended the period with an excess capital position of approximately $700 million. our adjusted operating return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 9.5%. the effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating income was 24.7% this quarter, slightly above the expected range of 23% to 24% primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings. now i'll comment on the results by segment, which you can see on slide 7 of the earnings presentation.
the u.s. and latin america traditional business reported a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $55 million, reflecting unfavorable individual mortality experience primarily due to higher-than-expected frequency of nonlarge claims and very low levels of variable investment income. we have provided some further commentary in the earnings presentation materials. we saw a particularly large concentration in claims from those over 70 years of age, as well as from older issue year vintages.
there's also growing incidental evidence -- anecdotal evidence, sorry about that, that all-cause mortality in the general population was higher beginning in march and possibly earlier. while it is difficult to provide definitive attribution at this time, the characteristics of the excess claims lead us to believe it is possible that some of these might be directly or indirectly related to covid-19. over time, we do expect to get more information and data to better assess the sources of adverse experience to define our assumptions going forward. our asset-intensive business reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $43 million this quarter, lower than the expected run rate, reflecting the impact of weak capital markets and some related deferred acquisition cost effects.
the lease capital markets resulted in lower fee income on annuities from lower account balances. moving to canada. the traditional segment had another good quarter but was down over the prior-year quarter, with pre-tax adjusted operating income of $36 million. results this quarter reflect favorable individual mortality experience, while the year-ago period was particularly favorable.
in the europe, middle east and africa segment, our traditional business reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $17 million, primarily reflecting favorable underwriting experience in the u.k. reported premiums totaled $390 million, up 7% on a reported basis versus a year ago and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. emea financial solutions business, which includes asset-intensive, longevity and fee-based transactions reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $36 million, relatively flat compared to the prior year, reflecting modestly unfavorable longevity experience and some client catch-up reporting. turning to our asia pacific traditional business.
pretax adjusted operating income totaled $24 million. this quarter reflects the negative effect of client reporting catch ups particularly related to one client. the results in australia were better than expected, producing the modest profit this quarter. reported asia pacific traditional premiums were slightly down, reflecting slower growth in asia.
our asia pacific financial solutions business reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $10 million, reflecting strong new business in asia, where we continue to provide broad-based solutions to our clients by combining our capabilities in product development and financial solutions. the corporate and other segment reported a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $19 million, lower than the expected average run rate, primarily from lower expense levels. we did report a net loss for the quarter as we had some below line items that were more significant than what we have seen in past quarters and were reflective of the turmoil in the financial markets, especially toward the end of march. we provided a reconciliation of pre-tax income and loss to pre-tax adjusted operating income on slide 9 of the earnings presentation.
there is a modest amount of investment impairments, primarily related to the energy sector and emerging markets. leslie, our chief investment officer, will comment on our investment portfolio after my comments. we reported a loss from embedded derivatives or less known as b36, primarily due to the widening of credit spreads in the quarter. this primarily relates to treaties structured on a funds-withheld basis.
the accounting is such that there can be volatility in the short term during periods of stress in the market, and that accounting volatility should reverse over time with minimal net effect. we continue to execute on a prudent capital management strategy with the goal of having sufficient capital to run our operations, report our ratings and provide solid returns to our shareholders. we believe rga's balance sheet is strong, and our excess capital position stands at $700 million. we have considerable liquidity and have substantially increased our liquidity in the quarter as cash and cash equivalents increased from $1.4 billion at the end of 2019 to $2.8 billion at the end of march.
rga's leverage ratios are at a comfortable level relative to our targets and limits. i'd like to highlight that we have a relatively stable liability profile, as you can see on slide 11, with low liquidity and disintermediation risks. we are confident that rga is in a position to manage through the current environment. we do expect to see some ongoing covid-related claims that will negatively affect our earnings, although at this time, it's difficult to accurately predict the ultimate impact.
given the fluidity of the situation, there are simply too many unknowns. clearly, earnings will be impacted this year, and it will be difficult to achieve our intermediate targets. we will provide more information as we gain more clarity into the ultimate impact of this pandemic. and now i'd like to turn the call over to leslie barbie, rga's chief investment officer, to provide additional comments on rga's investment portfolio.
leslie barbi -- chief investment officer
thanks, todd. as we know, in addition to the health consequences of covid-19, the actions to flatten the curve in affected regions have significantly impacted economies and markets globally. monumental central bank and fiscal policy actions have been launched to help bridge this period of economic interruption, and many companies have moved to build cash to weather this period, including from record corporate market issuance. nonetheless, this is a stressful time for the economy and market.
we believe rga's high-quality investment portfolio is well-positioned for a challenging economic period. it is well diversified across asset classes, sectors, issuers and by geography. as highlighted on slide 15, as of march 31, our average portfolio quality was a, with over 95% of our fixed maturity security and investment grade. the portfolio has a low amount of subordinated debt and equity investments.
our investment strategy positioned us well with an underweight to energy and to overleverage bbb investment. while our commercial mortgage loan portfolio had an average loan-to-value ratio of 58%, and our clo portfolio had an average quality of aa. importantly, we are a financially strong reinsurance company. and while we proactively manage the asset portfolio, rga's liability profile and liquidity management enhances our ability to hold valuable investments through the cycle.
a combination of people, process and strategy resulted in our defensively positioned portfolio coming into 2020. i'm so impressed with the engagement and expertise of our global investment professionals and the energy they bring to meet this challenging environment every day. our investment leaders averaged 29 years of experience across public projects in real estate. i can tell you from my own career, which we began over 30 years ago, how impactful it is to have seasoned investors at the helm who have successfully navigated multiple difficult economic and market cycles.
that perspective drives our investment process commitment to ongoing deep diligence and risk management. we focus on downside risk and principal protection in our investment collections in our surveillance. from a top-down portfolio management perspective, we utilized scenario stress analysis to inform our asset allocation and total portfolio risk taking. our mission is to contribute to rga's financial strength and liquidity, as well as rga's earnings power.
we deliver that by having the right talent, capabilities and investment process. we emphasize higher quality fixed-income investments and disciplined approach to underwriting and diversification of risk. our defensive portfolio positioning was in place well ahead of 2020 because of our disciplined risk management approach, focused on avoiding uncompensated risk. as examples, i'll highlight two of our long-standing strategies with respect to bbbs and our investments in energy.
information is provided on slide 16 and 18. it has been a known feature of this credit cycle that a portion of companies within the bbb rating category have pushed leverage beyond traditional bbb metrics. our strategy was to avoid over-levered bbbs, except where we assess we're appropriately compensated. in the slide deck, we have provided some analysis that we think demonstrates the success of our strategy.
for example, as of march 31, one major rating agency had put 8.8% of the bbb index universe on negative rating watch. our portfolio has about half of that amount in that category, a meaningfully better outcome. as another indicator, we not only have a lower portion of our bbbs in bbb minus than the market index proportion, our bbb minus holdings notably outperform the bbb minus slice of the index in the turbulent market action in march. on the energy front, we have had a long-standing underweight due to our assessment of risk relative to the previous higher oil prices.
as shown on slide 18, almost half of our holdings were in midstream, which is a more defensive less oil price-sensitive sector, and 87% of our total holdings were an investment-grade. with regard to our portfolio's non-spread investment yield, in the first quarter, it was 4.08%. the difference versus the fourth quarter was primarily related to less uplift from variable investment income. the new money rate in the first quarter was 4.20%.
this was supported by a strong start to the year in private asset production at a healthy spread over public market comps. starting in march, we focused on accumulating cash given negative developments related to covid, the economic outlook and volatile capital markets, so paused on putting money to work. the last topic i'll comment on is variable investment income or vii. in the first quarter, we had minimal vii.
we believe this is primarily a timing issue. we expect to catch up on the majority of our expected 2020 run rate for vii over time. although in current market conditions, a meaningful portion of that income could be pushed late in the year or into 2021. private equity realizations and real estate joint venture sales have typically contributed a large share of our strong vii performance over time.
with few of those assets being sold in the first quarter, those assets still reside in our portfolio and could provide income at a future point when sales occur. that said, activity right now in both of those markets for all market participants is primarily focused on managing existing investments, and it may be a few quarters before market conditions are favorable for realizations and sales in those two types of assets. those are two of the key portfolio features and investment strategies that i hope will help you better understand the positioning of our asset portfolio. with that, i'll hand it over to our chief risk officer, jonathan porter.
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
thank you, leslie. this morning, i would like to provide some insights into rga's global mortality business and our exposure to covid-19 impacts, including why we believe that the additional mortality rates in our business will be less than those in the general population. i'll begin with a review of the geographic and age characteristics of our mortality portfolio on slide 23. rga's mortality risk is diversified across multiple geographic regions as measured by risk announced, our largest block is in the united states, which represents 45% of our global exposure.
the next largest blocks in order are the u.k. at 17%; 12% in canada; 5% in australia; and 4% in hong kong. in total, these five countries represent 83% of our global mortality exposure. the balance of asia, excluding hong kong, is 11% of the global total, spread across multiple countries in the region.
the exposure in emea, excluding the u.k., is 7%, again, spread across multiple countries. the combined mortality exposure in italy, spain and france, which are seeing some of the highest reported death rates of covid-19, represent approximately one-third of the 7% or about 2.5% of our global mortality risk. the age profile of the mortality business is an extremely important factor to take into account assessing any company's exposure to covid-19. emerging global data is clearly indicating that the virus has a much more severe impact on older-aged individuals and in particular -- and in those particularly aged 70 and older.
age-specific reporting in our key markets is showing that 70% to 80% of general population deaths are occurring at ages 70 and older. the table on the bottom right of slide 23 shows the portion of rga's mortality exposure, as measured by man at risk, for ages 70 and older compared to each country's general population. in total, our key market exposures to ages 70 and older is approximately one-third of the general population. what this means is that we would expect the additional death rate for our business to be materially less than those observed in the population statistics.
emerging data is also showing that individuals with pre-existing risk factors and conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity make up the vast majority of deaths. early april cdc data indicated that almost 90% of u.s. covid-19 hospitalizations involve one or more of these types of comorbidities, and more than 80% of u.s. icu admissions have chronic health problems.
similar results are being reported in other countries. this is an important factor when estimating the ultimate mortality rate on the block of insured lives as the underwriting process, as well as higher socioeconomic status of those buying insurance results in an overall healthier profile relative to the general population. evidence of the generally healthier profile of insurance compared to the general population is seen when comparing all-cause mortality rates between these two groups. while we believe that our mortality portfolio will experience lower additional mortality rates for the general population due to these age and health status differences, it is still too early to accurately estimate the ultimate impact that covid-19 will have on claims.
there are many additional factors that will influence the future course of the virus, including country-specific circumstances such as hospital capacity, testing infrastructure and contact tracing, as well as how both public and private actions are managed. further, it is still not clear how covid-19 is impacting all other causes of death, both in the short-term and long term. and the timing and effectiveness of treatments or vaccine will play a significant role in the ultimate impact of the virus. as an illustration of the potential impact of covid-19, if we were to calibrate to 100,000 u.s.
general population deaths and apply a similar set of impacts globally, which implies 1.4 million additional global general population deaths, we estimate this would result in extra pre-tax mortality claims to rga of between $400 million and $500 million. i want to emphasize that this range is based on multiple underlying assumptions that are still developing and wanted to particularly highlight three areas that could lead to lower impacts as we see actual experience emerge. first, this estimate assumes that all claims are from marginal extra deaths, and it is likely that some of these will be accelerations of deaths from people who would have died from other comorbid causes in the current or future years. it also assumes that countries will experience a similar age-adjusted impact of additional mortality, which we can already see developing differently.
for example, australia and hong kong have had very little additional mortality thus far, which will mean no material impact to rga in those markets. it also assumes that different population subsegments within a country will be equally impacted, and we are seeing emerging data that -- for example, lower socioeconomic frontline service roles, long-term care facility workers and residents. to the extent that there is a lower life insurance penetration in some harder hit subsegments, this will result in lower overall claims for both the insurance industry and rga. finally, it is worth noting that rga also has a material block of longevity risk, which acts as a partial hedge for our mortality exposure.
the majority of our longevity business is concentrated at the older ages with approximately 70% of that exposure at ages 70 and older. as you would expect, we continue to devote significant resources to gathering and analyzing data, engaging with external experts and drawing on our decades of knowledge gained as one of the world's premier life and health reinsurers. given what we know now and looking at a range of potential stress scenarios, we believe that additional plans from covid-19 will be well below our one-in-200 capital stress level. and that our diversified global franchise and strong focus on risk, capital and liquidity management will allow us to manage through this crisis.
with that, i'll turn it back over to todd larson.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. that concludes our prepared remarks, so we'd now like to open it up to you for your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we will now take the first question from humphrey lee from dowling & partners. please go ahead.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking the question. in terms of the u.s. mortality, i appreciate that the additional disclosure that jonathan provided. but i guess when you think about the impact for the quarter, i guess how many elevated claims did you see in this quarter? and how is that compared to -- and then how did the number of claims trended for the quarter and into april?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, humphrey. i think i will turn that question over to alain and jonathan.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
sure. so this is alain. thank you, humphrey. in terms of reporting claims in the quarter, certainly, there were very few covid-identified claims that appeared in the quarter, although some have started to come in after the end of the quarter related to the quarter, and we're seeing more in april.
so clearly, in april, i think we are seeing evidence of covid claims. and as we said before, it's really difficult to comment on any one month at a time. but going back to the first quarter, we did have some impact from covid, but i don't want anyone walking away with the idea that it was all covid.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, anything to add?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
no, no, nothing for me.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i might add one thing. humphrey, as you're well aware, cause of death reporting for us is always lagged. so our first-quarter analysis is limited on that basis, and it will take time for that cause of death analysis to complete. and in addition, there is some uncertainty with respect to the coding of covid and covid-related deaths throughout the course of the early part of the pandemic.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
understood. and then shifting gear to capital management. so i understand you currently suspended your share repurchases. i guess what factors do you have to see before you start contemplating resuming buybacks?
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'm sorry. you asked what factors would we look at before we reinstate buybacks?
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
yes. so what do you need to see in order to -- for you to resume buybacks?
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
so sure. so we're pretty consistent. we, of course, want to deploy capital, as we talked in the past, back into the business to support transactional activity. so that message hasn't changed.
we'd still like to deploy the capital back into the business to support attractive transactions. but more specifically, we need some more clarity around the ultimate, i think, path of the pandemic, both on what does it mean from a additional mortality claims over time, as well as, ultimately, with all the different global economies, what does it mean for the investment side. so we want to see some more clarity around where we expect this ultimately to go before we would reinstate our share repurchases.
operator
we will now take the next question from andrew kligerman from credit suisse. please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i wanted to get a sense of your premium growth outlook. in the united states, we saw in traditional net premium growth of about 1% versus historically more likely in the 2% to 4% range. and then, of course, there were pressures in asia.
so the part a of it would be in the near term, how do you see premium growth in both the u.s. and the rest of world? and then the second, the part b of it being, how do you think demand will be affected in the longer term with respect to buying of individual life insurance?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i can turn that over to alain to comment.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
yes. sure. so i think certainly in the short term, i think you can expect premium growth to be somewhat pressured. we are seeing signs of slowing production both in the u.s.
and in asia as a result of the impact of covid, stay at home, those kinds of elements. i'd like to think, though, first of all, i think it's definitely too early to talk about sort of long-term repercussions, but i'd like to think that the value of life insurance will have proven out through this pandemic. and that, in fact, we might be able to bridge the gap with the underserved markets that exist in different markets. and then certainly, from a transactional standpoint, i think it's fair to say we are continuing to see good opportunities primarily in asia right now.
and so certainly, from a premium growth standpoint there, i would expect to see a continuation of transactions over the course of either the year or into next year.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
and as you talk about transactions, could you give a little color on what types of transactions you're seeing? i think anna mentioned the pipeline is good at the beginning of the call, and maybe tie langhorne into it as well.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
so what i'd suggest is that such transactions we're looking at are very consistent with the types of things we've been doing in the past whether it be longevity, asset-intensive, financial reinsurance in some cases. i think it varies by market. it's quite possible that as we work our way through our economic -- the current economic environment, there will be some foresellers, but there may also be some people who prefer to just take a pause and see how well does this plays out before transacting. we talk about transactions are typically lumpy in normal times, i think that's probably very true and probably more so of what we're seeing today.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
and maybe if i could just add a comment or two. we continue to see the prt opportunities in europe and, perhaps, in part because the pension plans there have had less equity exposure relative to their u.s. counterparts. so funding ratios are not as impacted.
in the north america prt market, we do expect it to grow, although perhaps delayed somewhat to later in the year or maybe into next year for the reasons just alluded to in europe. as alain mentioned, continued interest in asia for the combined product development and capital solutions that is very good in our pipeline. and i would say in the u.s. asset-intensive market, maybe a little slower than in the recent past.
although there are opportunities in that pipeline, we are aware that some companies are thinking about and actively preparing to bring additional blocks to market. so overall, again, good pipeline similar type of opportunities as we've spoken about in the past.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
and anna, just mention langhorne. does that just sort of fit into this scenario, or is there anything different there?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
no, there is nothing different there, and the asset fits into the various opportunities that i've described.
operator
we will now take the next question from erik bass from autonomous research. please go ahead.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi. thank you. a bigger question on mortality. as claims have now had a negative variance of $50 million-plus for the three straight quarters, and i think it have been adverse in total for around six straight.
i realize the drivers have been different each quarter. but at what point do you need to reconsider your base claims assumptions and potentially reset expectations?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i will turn that over to alain and jonathan to comment.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
sure. why don't i start? certainly, we have seen a number of off quarters in the u.s. over the last few years. i'm not sure it's quite fixed straight, but what i'd say the experience we're seeing this time around is maybe a little bit different from what we've seen in the past.
typically, when we miss on u.s. mortality, it's attributable to a large claim volatility, which, as we've talked about, tend to average out over longer periods of time. we've also called out a slowing of mortality improvement in younger and middle ages in recent years. and i think we talked about this at investor day a couple of years ago.
if you go back over 50 years, we do see ups and downs on that, and in fact, i think over the last 50 years, we've seen 15 or so years of slowing mortality improvement. but what we're seeing this quarter in terms of higher frequency on small policies, claims at the older ages, claims and older writing vintages, together with some evidence that we're seeing of higher influenza-like illness hospitalizations, we're certainly seeing new information every day that suggests that some of the covid reporting, for example, is a little bit late. you've seen, i think, recently a report that the first diagnosis in france might have been as early as december 27. the first death in the u.s.
in santa clara is now, i think, february 6, which is two or three weeks earlier than previously thought. so it tends to point to influenza-like or potentially beginning covid-like impact on the book. and i think that given that, i think i'm reasonably comfortable that there are specific underlying indicators as to why we've missed this quarter.
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. and then maybe i'll just add that just to the question about reassessing. i mean, we regularly and constantly reassess our mortality expectations, not just in the u.s. but globally.
so that's a process that we go through to make sure that we're comfortable with our go-forward expectations.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you. and then if i could switch to the investment portfolio. i appreciate the additional disclosure. could you just provide some additional color maybe on how you expect the portfolio to perform in a recession? and do you have any estimate for what potential impairments could look like in a stress scenario? and also, how do ratings downgrades affect your capital given that a lot of your business is outside of u.s.
statutory entities?
leslie barbi -- chief investment officer
it's leslie -- oh, i'm sorry go ahead, anna.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
no, i was going to say why don't we start with leslie and then, perhaps, turn it to todd on the capital question.
leslie barbi -- chief investment officer
i love that stance. this is leslie. so this is certainly a difficult period to predict given the unusual mandated shutdowns and offsetting policy. so our approach has been to look at a variety of stress scenarios and the map factors from half of your cycles to our portfolio characteristics, meaning historical rating migration, impairments, loss severities and so forth and, in some cases, increase the stresses.
so we're considering a range of cases at the moment that can happen. our current expectation around economic activity, which is an important factor here, is that it somewhat resumes in the second quarter and then continue a gradual recovery over multiple quarters. given our stress testing and building off that central case, but not focused on only that, our top-down loss, we would say, our current best estimate over the next several quarters for impairments could be in the $300 million to $400 million range. and i say that could give you guidance.
but importantly, based on our bottom-up look, so we've really dug into all the credit to see how they're doing in this environment. based on that bottom-up look, we're not seeing that level of problems in the portfolio. we just want to plan for and realistically manage through a difficult environment. i'll note that some of the aspects i discussed before and are highlighted in the deck, point out that we have a defensively positioned portfolio within our categories, but we did apply those top-down more generic stresses to make sure we're prepared to manage through this.
and then i would say, and i know todd will comment, but what we connect those to capital impacts are all very manageable, and that's without even assuming that we take any portfolio management action.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
and maybe just to wrap it up. on the rbc-related companies, based on the analysis that sort of leslie just walk through and gave an overview of, we think it's very manageable in the rbc ratio. we probably could absorb impacts even without taking management action but very manageable. and then for the entire enterprise, looking at it from an economic capital and a rating agency capital perspective, basically, the way we are viewing it is a very manageable scenario.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
and i guess the last thing i'll throw in there is, certainly, all of that has been rolled up into the integrated look and planning at the company.

we will now take the next question from ryan krueger from kbw. please go ahead.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. going back to the $400 million to $500 million mortality scenario for 100,000 u.s.
deaths, can you provide a little bit more detail on that? i guess, in particular, were there any adjustments made for the age distribution or general -- or differences in insured population versus the general population? or did that assume kind of -- did it not make any, i guess, adjustments for those types of factors?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i'll turn this one over to jonathan.
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. ryan, thanks for the question. so yes. so just specifically, we have made adjustments for both of those factors.
so what we've done is we've taken projection of population-related deaths and then layered it on top of our specific age distribution and geographic distribution. and we've also adjusted for observed differences and expectations between the health status of insured lives versus general population lives. just to give you a sense of that, the impact of both of those factors combined at a global level is about a 50% reduction. now it does vary by country.
so as an example, age distributions are not uniform across our global business so you would expect to see a different adjustment for geographies with higher exposure to older ages than those with lower, although there is an adjustment in all cases because our population is younger -- or sorry, has less concentration of those older ages than general population. and of course, it is still unclear what the ultimate difference will be between insured lives and general population lives, but that's becoming clear. and as we get experience in claims reporting, we'll be able to refine that adjustment as well.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
ok. got it. so it adjusts for insured population versus general population, age distribution. i guess it does not adjust for the whole morbidity offsets and longevity offsets.
is that the right way to think about it?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yeah, that's right. so our longevity offset, where we would -- we estimate it would be approximately up to 10% of that amount. so that would be a reduction, i guess, on a net basis, if you include our longevity exposure. but yes, that's not built into the $400 million to $500 million.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and then there was some noise in asset-intensive this quarter. can you just give an updated outlook for your normal run rate earnings in that business at this point?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i'll hand that one over to todd to comment.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. in the quarter, ryan, given the market turmoil, some of the -- primarily on the variable annuity portfolio that we have, the account values went down so the expected projected future fee income, if you will, went down, and that accelerated some dac amortization. but once things get back to, i'll call it, come back to normal, i mean, i think the run rate is probably still valid albeit probably at that lower end of what we've provided.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from dan bergman from citi. please go ahead.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning. i guess, first, could you talk a little bit about the sources of cash or funds you have to fund any potential covid impact in near-term credit losses? i mean, should we be thinking about your normal free cash flow, capital freed from slower near-term sales and the current excess capital as the main likely funding sources? or are there other things we should be thinking of like debt issuance, the ultimate impact ends up being a little bit more severe? any thoughts on that would be great.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
anna, you want me to take that?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm sorry, todd. that is a todd question, yes, certainly.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. as far as liquidity, we're in very good shape there. over the course of the last few weeks, we have built up some additional liquidity, as i mentioned, to make sure that we can cover what we feel are even some of the more stressful scenarios on the claims side. and also, as you know, the claims will be paid out over several quarters, it won't be a onetime-type event.
so we feel very good on the liquidity side. on the capital side, we came into this with some excess capital. we always are looking at various forms of capital to make sure we are in a position to act on attractive transactions that we see in the market, as well as maintain capital levels sufficient to meet all of our subsidiary needs, as well as rating agency capital. so we will look at various alternative forms of capital.
what and when we execute on, i think, is still an open question as we see how this evolves.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks so much. and then maybe shifting gears a little bit, just with the improvement in australia results this quarter following a period of weakness. could you give a little bit more color on what drove the improvement there relative to the recent trend and just any updated thoughts on the outlook for profitability in that region going forward?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
perhaps, alain and todd?
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
sure. look, i'd say, obviously, we're very pleased with the results. but i'd be hesitant to suggest that the turnaround is over. we're benefiting from rate increases to a greater extent of the year and the quarters progressed.
we certainly continue to engage with clients in all aspects to remedy the business. but in terms of guidance for the rest of the year, i'm guessing that we'll probably still guide to a loss but maybe smaller than we might have thought. but i think it's very early, and i'd like to see a couple more quarters play out.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i agree with alain's comments. and the only thing i would add is that it was nice to see australia perform fairly well pretty much across the different business lines in both individual and group side. so it was a positive sign, but we still need to be managing that block very closely.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the questions.
operator
the next question comes from alex scott from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi good morning. first question i had is just sort of higher level on capital. when you go through the scenarios you've laid out, thinking through your one-in-200-year scenario and so forth, i mean, is there anything about this experience change to the way you would think about capitalization kind of on the other side of it on a go-forward basis? is there anything that would change the way that you view excess capital and how you measure that?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, do you want to take the first part of that question about our thinking on one-in-200-type of capital levels?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. so i mean i think, obviously, we're still in the middle of the pandemic, so things will play out over time, and we'll see sort of what the ultimate result is. but just looking at our one-in-200 sort of assessment of exposure, i think the dollar amounts that we have attached to that capital level, i still feel very comfortable with. we still believe that this pandemic will result in an ultimate impact, which will be well within the one-in-200 capital levels.
so at this time, i wouldn't have an expectation that we would revise or change your expectation on what that total level of capital would be.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
and todd, the second part of that question.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, outlook on a go-forward basis, it's probably a little bit too early to give you a definitive answer on that beyond -- certainly, we're going to take into account what we are learning through this to see if there's a different capital mix and capital structure or anything we should add into our overall toolkit going forward. but i think it's too early to give you a definitive answer. i think what we've historically done as far as how we structure our legal entities and have liquidity facilities across the various enterprises will serve us well as we go forward here, but as far as change in the overall capital model and mix, it's too early to give you a definitive answer.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then maybe just on pricing, could you talk at all about pricing and season rates and what you're seeing? and is there, property and casualty, in a situation where you have a catastrophe and it helps pricing on the other side of it? and i get that question sometimes on the life side and whether something like this would influence pricing or not going forward, so i'd just be interested if there are any comments on that. and maybe if it would even impact some of the in-force transactions and how do you price those.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
alain, if i can turn that over to you.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
sure. so i think there's two set questions there. if you think about the traditional business, certainly, we're pricing for the business for very long periods of time. we do tend to adjust year over year as mortality and other factors evolve, whether they be interest or morbidity elements.
sitting here a few weeks, maybe months into the pandemic, it's probably difficult to talk about how that might impact pricing over the future because as jonathan mentioned earlier, i think it's still too early to determine, for example, whether this might be an acceleration of mortality in terms of people at the older ages who might have passed in the next few months or whether there's something a little bit more fundamental that might set in. so i think it's probably too early, but typically, we certainly don't tend to move pricing around as drastically as in the p&c industry. on a transactional basis, i think certainly -- and this sort of applies to traditional as well, we are certainly very keenly looking at elements of anti-selection or reasons why transactions may be coming to the market and then applying, i guess, what i would term our usual diligence to the process. and so i think it'd be very transactional specific as to whether pricing might move up and down, but it's also impacted by the economic environment, the ability to source the right types of assets, those kinds of questions.
so sorry if i'm not giving a very clear answer, but it tends to be a little bit specific to any one transaction.
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
this is jonathan. maybe i can just add to that as well, that definitely from a risk selection perspective, as you alluded to. but the in-selection, we are making adjustments to our practices and for underwriting, both on an individual cases and on a more larger transaction basis to take into account sort of the heightened risk profile and some expectations.
alain neemeh -- chief operating officer
and i think it's also fair to say on group life and health, for example, where that is annually repriced business, we may see earlier impacts there. but again, we're working our way through all right now.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. ok. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore. please go ahead. please make sure your mute function is switched off.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
sorry. yeah. of the $400 million to $500 million impact, can you give us a sense for how much of that would be from the u.s. versus non-u.s.?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. so i don't think we want to split it out at this time, just given some of the uncertainties that we're seeing, in particular, at the geographic level. i guess what i would point you to, just to give you a directional sense is if you look at our net amount of risk distribution that we've provided in the slide, that's sort of a baseline. but then you would need to sort of factor in the fact that our older -- our businesses that are skewed more to older ages would have a slightly -- would have a higher proportion impact than what that minimum risk or would show.
so that would give you a directional sense, but i think it's too early to split out given some of the uncertainties.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and the reason i asked, so the sensitivity was 100,000 u.s. deaths in 4.4 million of global. could you correct me?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes, 1.4 million global. so what we're doing is effectively taking a scenario that we're applying to the u.s., which is about 0.3 per thousand times the u.s. population gives you 100,000 deaths and applying that same scenario to other countries across the world and then age adjustment.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
got you. and is it fair to say -- i mean, given where we're at now, i think we're over 70,000 u.s. deaths. this might actually be the 2q impact based on current trajectory.
and maybe there's a lag and delay given the reporting of claims, but i mean, it seems to me like this is a reasonable base case just given where we're at. globally, it sounds high, but it could be some underreporting going on there. but is it fair to say that this is probably more of a base case at this point?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. i think as you point about global, i mean, that's very important to take into account. the fact that our business is global, and it's not all in the u.s. so that's something, as i mentioned, a couple of examples of australia and hong kong, right, where there's -- i think in total between those two countries, there's 100 general population deaths.
so clearly, that would be almost zero impact to us. also, i guess i would point you back to some of my comments earlier about some areas of uncertainty, which may result in lower overall impact to us. i think that, combined with sort of the timing element that you brought in, i don't think we can definitely say this will be a number that we would see in a quarter. i think we need to see, i guess, what reporting comes in and it may be different than this.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
got you. and then the kind of within that, the u.k.-related impact, i know there's another big sensitivity given -- are you able to shed a little bit of light on -- since that is kind of a very overweight exposure for you, what your kind of baseline mortality expectation within this sort of global overall assumption is?
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes. actually, i'm glad you asked about the u.k. so i mean, an interesting dynamic we have in that market is that's where most of the vast majority of our longevity business is written. so when you look at the u.k., the net exposure in the u.k., those two pieces largely offset.
and it's not perfect, and things will obviously move depending on the age distribution. but because our longevity business is skewed to older ages, we're somewhat immunized to the ultimate death rates in the general population in the u.k. because the losses we would expect to see on our mortality book would largely be offset by the gains on our longevity business.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
that helps. jonathan, correct me if i'm wrong, too. but in the u.k., on the mortality side, some of our underlying share is on the younger side because it's primarily tied to mortgage insurance-type policy.
jonathan porter -- chief risk officer
yes, that's right, todd. i mean, yes, that's a good point. another thing to point out is our u.k. age distribution is definitely skewed to be much younger than some of the other countries where we operate, which will reduce the mortality claims expectation.
todd larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
got it. that's helpful. thanks, guys.

operator
good day and welcome to the reinsurance group of america fourth quarter 2020 results conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to introduce mr. todd larson, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and ms. anna manning, president and chief executive officer.
please go ahead, mr. larson.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you. good morning and welcome to rga's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. with me this morning on the call is anna manning, rga's president and chief executive officer; alain neemeh, chief operating officer; leslie barbi, chief investment officer; jonathan porter, chief risk officer; and jeff hopson, the head of investor relations.
we will discuss the fourth quarter results after a quick reminder about forward-looking information and non-gaap financial measures. following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from expected results. please refer to the earnings release we issued yesterday for a list of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. additionally, during the course of this call, information we provide may include non-gaap financial measures. please see our earnings release, earnings presentation, quarterly financial supplement and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to gaap measures.
and now i'll turn the call over to anna for her comments.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, todd. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. i hope you are all remaining safe and staying healthy. the loss and anxiety caused by the pandemic is extraordinary. and on behalf of everyone at rga, i would like to express profound depreciation for those on the front lines in the fight against the pandemic and offer our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones. through these tough times, i remained incredibly proud of the role that rga has played in an industry that helps to safeguard the financial futures of millions of families from the unforeseen tragedies of life. our purpose has never been made clear during this past year.
let me now move to our results. last night we reported adjusted operating eps of $1.19, which we consider another solid quarter in the context of the pandemic. in this quarter, we were able to absorb estimated total covid-19 related claim costs of $300 million globally and delivered profitable earnings due to the underlying strength in many of our businesses. these include our asia business, our us group and individual health operations and our us asset-intensive business.
additionally, excluding the impact of claims attributed to covid-19. our us individual mortality experience was again favorable this quarter. reported premium growth was strong, driven by results in emea and asia. we completed a number of transactions in the quarter and deployed approximately $100 million of capital. the transaction pipeline is very good overall and includes opportunities in all our regions. our investment portfolio held up well, and we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, an excess capital of $1.3 billion. our approach to capital deployment during this crisis remains prudent, disciplined and balanced.
as i step back and consider our full year results, we reported adjusted operating eps of $7.54. this includes absorbing estimated total covid-19 related claim costs of $720 million globally. and when adjusted for covid-19 related offsets, including longevity and reduced expenses, we estimate the full year impact of covid-19 to be roughly $6.80 on adjusted operating eps. i'm encouraged by the fact that our underlying fundamental performance and client relationships remained strong. this speaks to the resilience of our global franchise, the benefits of our diversified business and to the success of our client-focused strategy.
as we look forward, it is clear that covid-19 remains both the global health and economic challenge. and we expect to see a meaningful level claims in the first half of 2021. but we believe that the impact will be manageable, given our strong balance sheet and our underlying earnings engine. we are optimistic that we will begin to see the benefits from the global vaccination programs as we move into the rest of the year, after which we expect to see some normalization of results. in the meantime, we will continue to remain focused on protecting our employees, serving our clients and supporting the industry and our communities.
the quality, strength and resilience of our business give us confidence that we will emerge from the pandemic, position to take advantage of the opportunities ahead and continue to build on our long track record of value creation. thank you for your interest in rga. and i hope you all continue to remain safe and well.
let me now turn it over to todd to go over the detailed financial results.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, anna. beginning with consolidated premiums. for the quarter, we reported premium growth of approximately 9%, somewhat higher than recent quarters as we saw good business growth in some areas in addition to some client catch-ups have benefited the reported premiums. the effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating income was 18.3% for the quarter. below the expected range of 23% to 24%, as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits and tax benefits associated with differences in bases and foreign jurisdictions.
turning to the segment results listed on slides 8, 9 and 10 of the earnings presentation. the us and latin america traditional segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $89 million in the quarter. our individual mortality experience for the quarter, excluding the estimated covid-19 claim cost were favorable.
let me provide a little more detail. approximately $230 million of claims are attributed to covid-19, including $100 million of ibnr claims. the approach is to attribute covid-19 claims is consistent with that used in the second and third quarter, which continues to track quite well. we also continue to see excess mortality in the quarter consistent with cdc, reporting a significant levels in the general population. although, we believe a portion of this is likely related to covid-19, we have chosen not to include it in our estimated covid-19 claim costs.
overall, when we simply adjust for 2019 specific death, our experience this quarter would have been favorable, primarily due to lower large claims. i would also note that our 1999 to 2004 business, excluding covid-19 continues to perform in line with our mortality expectations as we set back in 2015. also our group and individual health business performed well in the quarter. our asset-intensive business reported a good result for the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher variable investment income and strong equity markets. us capital solutions reported fourth quarter pre-tax adjusted operating results that were better than our expectations, albeit the decrease against the strong prior-year period.
moving to canada. the traditional segment fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflected modestly unfavorable individual mortality experience, primarily due to the impact from covid-19, offset by favorable underwriting experience in other lines of business. our financial solutions segment performed well in the quarter, reflecting favorable longevity experience.
in the europe, middle east and africa segment our traditional business fourth quarter results reflected unfavorable mortality experience, partially explained by covid-19. the covid-19 claims are concentrated in south africa and the uk. additionally, as we've seen in the us, there's significant level of excess mortality experience in the population in south africa, over and above reported covid-19. emea financial solutions business fourth quarter results reflected modestly unfavorable longevity experience.
turning to our asia pacific traditional business. in the fourth quarter, asia had a favorable underwriting experience across most of the region. while we did see some covid-19 related impacts, these were offset by favorable non-covid experience as well as some data catch-ups on client reporting.
australia experienced a loss of approximately $26 million. this reflects a number of one-off, including an increase in reserves to reflect our recently updated industry table and in ibnr for estimated covid-19 claims. without these one-off, we would have been near breakeven for the quarter. for the year, we saw a much improved result over 2019 and when excluding the q4 one-offs, would have reported a small profit this year. while there remains some uncertainty in the australian market, we saw progress in 2020 and we continue to be prudent about new business and focused on actions to improve results. our asia pacific financial solutions business continued to produce good results in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the growth of business in asia. the corporate and other segment reported a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $24 million, relatively in line with the average run rate.
moving to investments. the nonspread portfolio yield for the quarter was 4.2%, a significant improvement relative to that in the third quarter, primarily due to above average run rate for variable investment income as we experienced a high level of commercial mortgage prepayments and some realizations in our various private partnerships. we believe our portfolio will defensively positioned coming into the crisis, credit performance continues to benefit from diligent security selection as well as economic reopening and policy responses. our portfolio average quality of a was maintained and credit impairments were minimal in the quarter.
as shown on slide 13 of our presentation materials, our excess capital position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion. rga's leverage ratios remained stable at the end of the year, following the second quarter senior debt issuance and our liquidity remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion.
looking forward, we expect to see some level of ongoing covid-19 impacts that will negatively affect our earnings until this crisis is resolved. however, we continue to view this as manageable and believe that our strong balance sheet, the power of our earnings engine and the benefits of our global franchise positions us to emerge from the pandemic in good shape to continue to produce attractive returns to our shareholders over time.
i'd also like to comment on slide 13 of the earnings materials. as you know, we are very proud of our track record of book value per share growth over the years. and while 2020 was a difficult year as a result of the pandemic, we have every confidence that we will continue creating value for our shareholders.
i also want to comment on the topic of financial guidance. we have historically provided intermediate-term financial guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter results. however, given the near-term uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic, we have decided not to provide guidance at this time.
i will now turn the call over to jonathan porter, our chief risk officer, who will provide some thoughts and updates on covid-19.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
thanks, todd. covid-19 mortality claim costs for q4 continue to be toward the lower end of our model expectations relative to general population reported covid-19 deaths and we continue to see lower insured mortality relative to the general population. the us still accounts for the majority of our estimated covid-19 claim costs. our ongoing mortality model updates did not result any material changes in the quarter. so we are reiterating our mortality rules of thumb for our major markets as shown on slide 14.
overall longevity experience was modestly favorable in the quarter, but less than the prior quarter run rate. this lower offset was expected due to lower longevity -- sorry, due to longer longevity reporting lives and differences in country specific mortality rates over the period. we expect elevated claim cost to continue in the first half of 2021 based on the level of ongoing covid-19 death in the general population. although, uncertainty exists and the ultimate impact of new covid-19 variance, it is good to see some recent positive signs as well. many countries are experiencing decreases in new case counts and deaths from the peak of the holiday season waves and the preliminary data from the global rollout of vaccines looks promising. we expect the vaccines will have a material beneficial impact on general population mortality in particular as those that are most vulnerable to severe outcomes are vaccinated. we continue to closely monitor all of these developments, and we'd expect to update our views if needed, as new data emerges.
let me now hand it back to todd.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. that concludes our prepared remarks. we now like to open it up to you for your questions.

[operator instructions] we'll now take our first question from humphrey lee of dowling & partners. please go ahead.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my questions. i think you mentioned that you continue to see the difference between the insurer and general population mortality experience. since many of the primary companies saw worsening results, especially on the group side, i was wondering if that are insured versus general population will tell a difference remains kind of the same compared to early stages or if you've seen any kind of convergence between the two?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. thank you, humphrey. may i address that question to jonathan?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. hi, humphrey. so in our results, they've been somewhat consistent over the quarters. i mean, obviously there is some ups and downs, but the difference between insured and general population with respect to our claims has been relatively the same. and that's kind evidenced by the fact that we are at the lower end of our rules of thumb. so our expectations are being maintained.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then in terms of the non-us covid-19 claims, they seem to be weaker than the guidance -- what the guidance was implied especially because they are coming from countries that you don't really have much exposure. can you provide some colors in terms of what you saw in the quarter?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd, may i ask you to respond and address that question?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. hi, humphrey. so, yes, it's going to spread around a little bit. so for the quarter and these are estimated numbers, i would say the covid for south africa was around $13 million, for india around $19 million, both canada and the uk about $6 million each, australia an estimated $8 million and us group business about $13 million.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. todd, this is jonathan. maybe i'll just add on to that. over the course of the year, so in any one quarter results could go up and down. but when you look at the full-year results, it's pretty close to what we expected. so about 80% of our claim costs are in the us, about 10% are in the uk and canada and about 10% at the world.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. good morning. so two questions. for the first one, from an accounting standpoint in all states recent life and [technical issues] that ldti impacts would have accounted for half of their book value. and instead they shows to divested a $3-plus billion loss. now i know all states business mix is different versus rga's, but what might make us comfortable that rga won't take a similar magnitude of charges, especially on term business. it's not accounted for under [indecipherable] when ldti does come in play in 2023. and if possible maybe discuss the different lines of business and the potential impacts.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd, may i ask you to address that question?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. hi, andrew. so yes, as you mentioned the standard was deferred again another year into 2023. we're certainly working through everything that we need to do to implement in other standard for our existing, what's called the [indecipherable] business. one thing that i would point out, the overall economics of the underlying business haven't really changed with the new accounting standard is just how the financial reporting will look like as we go through implementation and then new accounting under the new standard as we go forward. it would be premature for us to provide any numerical information at this point as we're still looking at the various assumptions of applying some of the interpretations that we need to make as a reinsurance company. so as time goes on and we are further along in the implementation, we'll start sharing some information. at this point, it's very difficult to comment on any impact.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it, todd. okay. thank you. and then with regard--
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
andrew may i -- sorry, may i also offer an additional perspective and that is we have business around the globe. so our book different then the book that you referenced. we also have a very long history of performance on mortality -- global mortality business as well as our gfs business and all our other businesses. so i would offer that up for some context, as well.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. got it. thank you, anna. and then my other question. i just have three data points upfront to the question, and i'll get to it. so first in 2015, rga's ceo greig woodring acknowledged that this pricing of the 1998-2004 business, i think todd you mentioned a little earlier in the call that it's performing in line. at the time, greig had stated that rga would -- in line with expectations, greig had said that it would probably lose about $60 million a year over several years.
the second point is that in each of the three years before covid-19, rga has posted greater than a 10% return on equity. and then the third point is that in contrast, in life reinsurance two of your three leading global reinsurance competitors are targeting mid to high single-digit returns and the other is targeting 10% to 12%. but all three have taken sizable charges on their 1998 to 2004 blocks. so my question is, how is the $60 million a year evidence in your test 10-plus roes and your targeted 10% to 12%, because it's just not appearing evident.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i will ask both alain and todd to address the aspects of that question, andrew. todd, alain, if i may.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
sure, todd maybe i'll start. hi. andrew, alain here. as you referenced, we did mention that that block of business was underperforming. i think perhaps when greig made those comments, there was a sense that that block was going to get smaller over time, i think that is happening. i would say that the mortality as todd alluded to has been performing in line with our recent expectations, certainly though we've probably been facing some additional interest rate headwinds as we have on the whole of our traditional block of business. i don't know that we necessarily break up the blocks of business to look at actual roes. but i'll let todd comment on sort of roes in the totality of our business.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so, on roes and certainly we've produced those roes overall from an enterprise perspective, there's going to be some lines are above some lines that are below. but overall, we've been able to deliver that level roe. and as far as comparing to competitors, there's is different accounting bases that are used that are directly comparable to ours. i'm not sure if i can directly reconcile the two.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
yes. the other thing maybe andrew -- sorry, it's alain neemeh, just to add in. we've talked in the past about taking the long view on our client relationships and certainly looking at the totality. and in that vein, we have -- i'll say work to identify where there are material balances and look to restore a better balance with those clients. you referenced our competition and some of the charges and some of the actions they've taken. i think we've been pretty clear. we don't have a broad-based rate action strategy, but that doesn't preclude the possibility of taking or having taking rate actions were appropriate. we just prefer to work through those types of issues with clients directly.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question of erik bass of autonomous research. please go ahead.
eric bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi. thank you. in emea, can you talk about results in the financial solutions business this quarter? and the level of covid impacts in the longevity business? and then given the delays in reporting, you talked about are we more likely to see the surge in population deaths that occurred in december show up in your first quarter results.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
erik, thank you for the question. i think that should be -- that's directed to todd and perhaps jonathan.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. we did see -- as we mentioned, slightly unfavorable longevity in the quarter. and also in the quarter, as you know, we have pluses and minuses when we get data catch-up reporting from our clients. and that was a little bit not negative but not as much as we would have expected in the quarter, just due to what information we received. i think taking a step back, given the block, we still view it as very positively and would expect to continue to perform on average as you seen it perform historically, which is quite well.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. and this is jonathan. maybe just to talk about the lag in reporting. i mean, you're right, there are longer lags in longevity reporting, which means the results that we're seeing in q4, although we can put into an exact timeframe, just given it's a bit variable depending on the treaty. it's really -- moving more reflective of the summer level of mortality that we saw and those rates were generally quite a bit lower than we saw both in q2 and in q4. that's a particular issue for the uk, which is where most of our longevity business is concentrated, but there was very little excess mortality actually in summer months. so we do expect this to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and due to timing, as well and by geographies. but our rule of thumb that we've been thinking about longevity business that, which is around 10% ultimately relative to mortality. we still feel is a reasonable estimate.
eric bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful. and then maybe sticking with emea. can you provide some more color on a couple of the recent larger block deals that you've done in the region? and do these change your view of the normal quarterly earnings run rate for that business going forward?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's alain, if you could address the transactions and todd on the run rate?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
sure, anna. the transactions are very much in line with what we've done previously, so longevity swaps transaction. we've done some financial solution type transactions as well outside of emea. but in emea is mainly longevity.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
and as far as run rate, erik, i don't have any one at this point, but certainly it's good this year. a couple of nice deals closed.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from jimmy bhullar of pg morgan. please go ahead. jpmorgan, i apologize. please go ahead.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
no, it's ok. so first, i just had a question on the asia business and specifically on australia. if you could talk about what specifically it was that caused the loss this quarter and any new developments that you've seen in that market?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yes. again, i think the first to todd and the question on the market to alain.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. jimmy, there was a new industry table that was published during the year that the regulators expect the companies to adopt and provided some updated information on some of the disability income, the termination rates and that type of thing. once we looked at that in our table and it provide some experience from the longer duration type claims that may stay on claims for a while. and so, once we took a look at that, we did have an increase in our reserve levels and then we also set up some ibnr claims related to covid-19. and some of that was partially offset by some changes, but not the other way. but the table was a big driver along with the covid-19. if you back out those one-offs, as i mentioned in my comments, it was right around the breakeven quarter.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and is there any ongoing impact from the new data or is it just a catch-up?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
i would view the industry table is more of a catch-up.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then if you think about your results, you had given sensitivity on covid claims in the us and each of the last two quarters, your actual results have been better. any thoughts you have given to sort of reassessing that sensitivity or because it does seem like and it's only two quarters, but it seems a little bit overly conservative?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, may i ask you address that question.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. i'll take that and then maybe alain if you want to talk about the market in australia. yes. you're right, jimmy, we have been obviously tracking this and we continue to come up toward the lower end. i think exactly what you said, though it's a couple of quarters. there is some variability, obviously that we would expect to see in the future. so i think we just feel the appropriate position is to leave it the same for now and reassess as we do regularly each quarter whether a change is required or not going forward.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for that jonathan. back to alain if you could address the question on the australia market.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
sure. thanks, anna. we've talked in the past jimmy about the need for the industry to work through some issues. but i guess, one positive development is after the regulator has announced new di product requirements that need to be in place in october of this year with the aim of making disability income products more sustainable. so i think the industry is moving in the right direction. there is still obviously some stress on the financial results across the industry. and i think in that light, we're pretty pleased with our results for the year, which is slightly positive when you back out the industry table and the covid accrual.
maybe just a little bit more on the industry table that really was an attempt for the industry to bring into line -- i would say, di termination assumptions in the later durations where there is less information. so to todd point, i think we're quite comfortable. this is a catch-up and sort of very comfortable with the balance sheet moving forward.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from dan bergman of the citi. please go ahead.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i guess, to start, as we start thinking about the first quarter, that's typically when we'd see a seasonally high level of flu related mortality in the us. and clearly this year 1q results will be significantly pressured by covid. but i just wanted to see if you had any high-level comments on how we should be thinking about other -- the other non-covid mortality factors? on the one hand, i know you guys have been pressured in recent quarters by the excess population mortality not directly identified as covid that you called out. placed on the other hand, it sounds like factors like masking and social distancing and the potential to the flu season less severe than typical. just any thoughts on those two opposing trends, what you're seeing and really any help just thinking about that directional net impact would be helpful.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dan. i think a very low flu season would obviously be very welcomed. but i think any relief from the flu season would be modest in the context of our pandemic. i'll ask jonathan maybe to provide a little bit more color in terms of the relative sizes of those pluses and minuses. jonathan?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. thanks, anna. i mean, you're right, i mean, really what we're seeing in a flu data is quite incredible so far with essentially zero. and that's not due to lack of testing. in fact, you can see places were testing is actually even higher. so it really is quite amazing that the flu to slow. when you think of the flu season and the impact to us, and i'll talk -- we'll focus on the us here. usually you'd see about 50,000 to 60,000 general population deaths in a typical flu season, it ranges obviously based on severity. so you can kind of i think of that level of general population that's relative to the amount of covid deaths that we would incur plus the excess deaths that you mentioned, we do expect that those will continue as well just based on what we've seen so far in 2020. so that will offset if the flu is really close to zero, would be somewhere probably the middle of that range of 15,000 to 16,000.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thank you. and then maybe just now switching gears a little bit. now that we're further into the pandemic. i just wanted to see if there's any update you could provide on life reinsurance market conditions. are you seeing any impact from covid on session rates or the demand for life reinsurance? and have you noticed any change in competitive conditions? and how you -- overall industry as a whole are thinking about mortality pricing in light of covid?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
perhaps i'll turn that one over to alain and jonathan, if you really have anything to add, please feel free.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
sure. thanks, anna. i think from -- let me start maybe with just life insurance. i think certainly the pandemic has triggered increased awareness in the population the need for insurance protection. there's few studies out there from lumira and mib that show that the desire or the thinking about buying insurance is like quite substantially. so for example, there's about 30% of consumers that were surveyed that are likely to buy insurance in the next 12 months. that's probably a few months stated now. search traffic for life insurance is quite a bit up on google search traffic. so i think from a consumer perspective, we're certainly hopeful that that's going to get traction. companies have accelerated investments in digital effort to try and reach those consumers.
so i think the outlook, i would say is pretty good from a direct insurance standpoint. from a reinsurance standpoint, i would say we haven't seen much in the way of ups or downs. i think it continues to progress really along the lines that it has over the last few years. certainly, i think as reinsurers, we've demonstrated value by working with clients to adapt to the changing conditions through the pandemic. and i think that's generally been well regarded. transactional activity continues to be good. i think, when one thinks of consumer needs and sort of producing different products, our product development areas is quite strong. so i think we can play an important part of that. but i think all like to say, reinsurance demand i think continues pretty much as it has.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from tom gallagher of evercore. please go ahead.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
good morning. if you would mentioned that you were getting some selective rate increases, but not something that you would implement it in a broader way across your business, would you say, is a lot of that related to the early to mid-2000's block in terms of the rate increases you've gotten. and would you say those are largely done or are those still ongoing?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
alain, i turn this one to you.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
yes. look, i would say, tom, we're continually evaluating the profitability of our different businesses and the relationships with clients and the balance are imbalance there on. i would say, for the most part our underperforming business has been very much isolated to the 1999-2004 block. and i'd say it's a continuing activity to monitor and manage that business the way we believe it should be managed.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
so is there -- i guess, just a follow-up on that. would you say generally broadly like you're closer to the end of the repricing? or is that just an ongoing adjustment that you think might continue for over a series of years? if you're able to answer it that way.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
i would say, very much part of our ongoing management of our business.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question of ryan krueger from kbw. please go ahead.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi. good morning. the last couple of quarters you've had favorable large claims experience in the us mortality. i was wondering if you thought that was actually related at all to covid or if it's just a more random result that you had the last couple of quarters?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've had this internal conversation ongoing for both in fourth quarter and the third quarter. ryan, i think you can appreciate that it is very difficult to assess and make any definitive statement about whether it is or isn't. but perhaps i'll ask jonathan to share some of the observations or some of the opinions or at least what we're thinking about in respect of that. jonathan?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. thanks, anna. at this point, again, we believe it's more of just a part of the fluctuations inherent in our business. so these adjustments can go both directions. so in the past, as we've noted, we have seen adverse large claims experience. it's nice to see a couple of quarters now of positive large claims experience. but i wouldn't point to being a trend of anything that we can tie back to. so i'd say, it's just part of the fluctuations we would expect to see quarter-on-quarter in our underlying business.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and then one more on the us traditional. there were some moving parts in that business in 2020 and they will continue to the impacts from covid. is your view of the underlying earnings power of that business once we get out of the pandemic, so in that $300 million that $320 million on annual earnings range.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd, if i could ask you to address that question.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so that's something certainly we'll take a take a look at. as you know, and alain mentioned this earlier, we do have some interest rate headwinds for some of the book there. but we'll see, certainly it's going to be pressure. but overall, the other -- the us mortality markets, the group and the long-term care business has been performing quite well. so i don't have a direct answer for you. but we'll reassess it as we go through the next quarter or two and have a clear view into the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from john barnidge of piper sandler. please go ahead.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. israel has been the country that's been most aggressive in their vaccination program. do you see any markers early on in the week sense it's begun that suggest any insight to how we should be thinking of maybe covid vaccine programs globally impacting a tapering off of desk?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
jonathan, i think this one is for you.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. i mean, i think the short answer is, we are very encouraged -- i'd say, the rollout of the vaccine happening around the world. one of the things that starting to emerge in data, we mentioned israel specifically as well that just a real world validation that the vaccines are showing the same level of efficacy that they did in the clinical trial, so that's positive. in israel there are data points that we've looked at which showed that for individuals then had enough time-lapse since receiving the full vaccine. but there are clear indications of a significant reduction in both cases of covid-19, but also reduced severity and hospitalization. so i think both of these, if they continue should have a meaningful impact on a reduction in general population mortality, which then translates through, of course, reinsured mortality. one of the other things to keep in mind with vaccination programs is that many governments are targeting the most vulnerable group's first, which should accelerate the benefit in mortality. so when you think of it sort of 80-20 rule, 20% or 25% of the population, probably account for a large portion of the deaths related to covid-19. so population groups get vaccinated faster than mortality should also reduce at that same pace. so i think the signs you're seeing now early, but promising.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
great. john, if i could just add a comment, perhaps a longer-term perspective optimism about the longer-term. and that in respect of the new technologies that underpin some of these vaccines, we're cautiously optimistic that this is going to be a one and done that there's been a lot of money put into the development. and that they could be used potentially for other diseases, perhaps like the flu or perhaps cancers. so i want to also leave you with that longer-term observation. i'm sorry, did you have a follow-up as well.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
i did, and it's nice to have some optimistic news too. how do you -- i asked this question with all seriousness, how do you view cryptocurrencies within their investment portfolio? we had an s&p 500 company come out and say it's part of their cash and cash equivalents. we now have other public companies microstrategy, overstock that have allocations that in their cash. so i was wondering how rga view this as well.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd, may i ask you to address this?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so i didn't quite -- john -- quite catch the first part of your question.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
how do you view cryptocurrencies i.e., bitcoin or digital gold as a part of your investment portfolio or cash and cash equivalents. there are public companies now allocating a portion of their cash and cash equivalents or the investment portfolio to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. thanks. thanks for repeating. well, from my perspective and maybe i'll let leslie chime in. i haven't been in a lot of conversations around investing in that. so sitting here, i haven't had much in the way of any discussions. leslie, i don't know if you guys have looked at it at all.
leslie barbi -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
sure. hi, this is -- yeah, i'm on. so we're not currently investing in cryptocurrency. i think if we look to that you would think about it as a currency, we tend of more kind of match our business currency exposure. and i don't think i think of it, it's cash that you have currency exposure if you're not doing business in crypto. so i agree with that, and as well that my understanding is currently the accounting is different than other currencies and can create more volatility. so we're not currently doing it, we keep our minds open. we're looking at all different things that currently fit our currency framework.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from brian meredith. please go ahead.
unidentified participant
thanks. this is mike [phonetic] on for brian. so, just following up on 1998-2004 block. so there's clearly a lot of investor interest or almost concern about this year. so i'm hoping you can maybe share some more details. but just from my perspective, there are three key things to note. one you restated, i think 30% of the block in 2014. two, i think you're actually known as a high-priced reinsure during that period, particularly relative to your european counterparts. and then third, i think it's conceivable that covid is actually accelerating maybe some of that roll off of mortality. so maybe if you could -- if you agree with any of these or if you could add anything i think will be helpful for investors just because when there is sort of a lack of information people tend to assume a negative bias. thanks.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for that question, mike. alain and jonathan, would you please address?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
yes, sure. it's alain. i guess, what i would say a couple of things, first off, the 1999-2004 block probably represents about of our quarter of our us individual block today it's declining over time. the older issue wages in that block are probably about 4% of the whole. so it's a block that is slowly running off. i think in terms of whether we're a high price reinsurer or not. look, i would say, it's a good solid competitive environment. i think that comment probably draws from the fact that during that period of time, our market share would have dropped. so whether we were high price to whether we perhaps saw some of the risks or felt that the pricing environment was maybe a little bit too sharp. i don't know that's sort of a longtime back. but i think we tend to look at it in the context of our overall block of business. and when one considers the age of that block and the impact of covid on our different age groups, i think it is quite possible to think that some of those people are perhaps starting off a little bit more quicker than we might have expected. i think it's probably too early to draw any kinds of conclusions. but i'll kind of leave it at that. i don't know jonathan if you want to add anything.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. just on acceleration piece. i mean, you added it's difficult just given we don't have current underwriting information to otherwise project to how people who will have died from covid-19, how long they would have lived otherwise. but i think again it's reasonable, i believe, expect that it will be some benefit. and at this time, i think that we feel it will be a modest tailwind for us.
unidentified participant
thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from tom.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
hi. thanks for the follow-up. just a few detailed questions on the us and latin traditional. what exactly is your latin american exposure? you're not providing any sensitivity. so i assume it's not very high that some of the countries that have been hit hard.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. this is john. our net amount at risk exposure in latin america, it's about 1% of our total net amount at risk. so it is very modest. it's also a mix of both morbidity and mortality risks.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
got you. and then the follow-up is, i assume that favorable health was long-term care this quarter. what the portion of your earnings in that segment is coming from long-term care?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so long-term care, it's -- i was trying to think how best interest as a percentage of the total given the unusual total this year. maybe the best way to -- in a size that is in the long-term care business, which in the us individual health, what we call individual health, our expectations would be in around a $100 million pre-tax income on an annual basis.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
so that's normal -- under normal condition. so i assume that's running better than that. currently is that a fair way to think about it.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, it did run better than that the expectation this year.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
so that's like over a quarter of the year, us and latam traditional earnings. i didn't realize it was that high.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
and it's been about that level of last couple of years or so i would say. but it is not growing significantly just given, develop a lot of new business activity in that line of business.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. no further questions at this time, i would like to turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. thank you.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. well, thank you everyone for joining us today and your continued interest in rga. and i hope everyone and their families stay safe. thank you very much.

2021-Q1,RGA,2021-05-07 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
please standby. good day, and welcome to the reinsurance group of america first quarter 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to introduce mr. todd larson, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and anna manning, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead, mr. larson.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. good morning, and welcome to rga's first quarter 2021 conference call. with me this morning on the call is anna manning, rga's president and chief executive officer; alain neemeh, chief operating officer; leslie barbi, our chief investment officer; jonathan porter, chief risk officer; and jeff hopson, head of investor relations. we will discuss the first quarter results after a quick reminder about forward-looking information and non-gaap financial measures.
following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from expected results. please refer to the earnings release we issued yesterday for a list of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. additionally, during the course of this call, information we provide may include non-gaap financial measures. please see our earnings release, earnings presentation, quarterly financial supplement and our website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to gaap measures.
and now i'll turn the call over to anna for her comments.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, todd. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. last night, we reported a loss of $1.24 in adjusted operating eps, which included $474 million in covid-19 impacts or $5.31 per share. in the context of a quarter that saw pandemic related deaths reached their highest peak in some of our markets. this was obviously a challenging quarter for us. but if i take a step back, our core business performed well overall, and we consider this another solid quarter, further demonstrating the resilience of our global business platform and franchise. both our asia traditional and financial solutions businesses had excellent results. u.s. group and individual health performed well, and australia was breakeven.
during the quarter, we completed a number of in-force transactions, deploying $100 million in capital, which will further add value to our underlying earnings engine. the transaction pipeline remains very good with opportunities in all our regions. our approach to capital deployment during this crisis remained balanced and disciplined as we seek opportunities to deliver long-term value. i'm also proud to announce that for the 10th consecutive year, rga has been ranked #1 for business capabilities on a global basis by nmg in their 2020 global reinsurance report. leveraging our capabilities and being a trusted partner as well as a thought leader, has allowed us to deliver value to our clients throughout the past year. a point of personal pride in this organization and a tribute to all our employees and our culture of client centricity. results in our u.s. mortality business were significantly impacted by the certain covid-19 claims seen in the first three months of the year. considering the elevated level of population depth, these results are not unexpected.
our large claim experience was in line this quarter after being very favorable in the previous two quarters. and our mortality performance over the past 12 months, after adjusting for covid-19 claims, has been in line with our expectations. todd and jonathan will provide additional information on covid-19 impacts for all our businesses. as we look forward, there is reason for optimism as increasing vaccination rates in the u.s., u.k. and canada should reduce the level of covid-19 deaths through the remainder of the year. and other markets should follow, as vaccine availability continues to expand.
rga's business fundamentals are strong, our business prospects are robust and we are taking appropriate actions to protect our business and position rga for profitable growth. as a final point, it is worth reflecting that through the end of the first quarter, rga has incurred over $1.2 billion in covid-19 claims since the pandemic began. our ability to absorb these claims is a testament to our financial strength, but it also serves as a reminder of the important purpose that our industry and rga play in helping millions of families around the world who have been affected by this pandemic. thank you for your interest in rga, and i hope you all remain safe and stay well.
let me now turn it over to todd to go over the detailed financial results.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, anna. rga reported a loss for the quarter of $115 million on a pre-tax adjusted operating basis. adjusted operating eps was a loss of $1.24 per share, which includes covid-19 impacts of $5.31 per share. our trailing 12-month adjusted operating roe was 3.7%, which was reduced by covid-19 impacts of 8.8%. reported premiums increased 3% in the quarter. growth was 5%, excluding the premium decline in australia, reflecting our continued caution in that market. the effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating loss was 26.9% for the quarter, above the expected range of 23% to 24% due to the geographical mix of the earnings. turning to the segment results that are represented on slides seven and eight of our earnings presentation. beginning with the u.s., the u.s. and latin america traditional segment reported a pre-tax, adjusted operating loss of $344 million in the quarter, including covid-19 claim cost of $358 million.
let me spend a minute providing a little bit more detail. for individual mortality, approximately $340 million of claim costs are attributed to covid-19. the approach used to estimate covid-19 claims is consistent with that used throughout 2020. we also experienced some excess mortality claims in the quarter that is likely directly or indirectly related to covid-19. which is not unexpected, given the excess mortality experience that has been observed in the general population throughout the pandemic. it is important to note that our mortality experience over the past 12 months, excluding covid-19, was in line with our expectations.
our group and individual health business both performed better than our expectations in the quarter. variable investment income was strong in the quarter as the limited partnership investment performance was favorable. our asset-intensive business reported results modestly below the expected run rate due to some unfavorable policyholder experience. u.s. capital solutions reported results that were in line with our expectations. moving to canada. the traditional segment, first quarter results reflected covid-19 claim cost of approximately $26 million. our financial solutions segment performed well in the first quarter, reflecting favorable longevity experience, which we attribute to covid-19. in the europe, middle east and africa segment, our traditional business results reflected a meaningful level of covid-19 claims in both the u.k. and south africa.
we estimate the covid-19 claim cost for the emea traditional segment in the quarter were $98 million. emea's financial solutions business results -- reflect the negative effects of model updates and the longevity offset from covid-19 was lower-than-expected as a result of longer reporting lags, but we expect that benefit to come through in future periods. turning to our asia pacific traditional business. in the first quarter, asia had favorable underwriting experience across most of the region. while we did see some covid-19-related impacts, they were modest and within our expectations. australia results were breakeven for the quarter. while there remains some uncertainty in the australian market, we are continuing to see progress and remain prudent in our approach to new business and focused on actions to improve results. our asia pacific financial solutions business continued to produce good results in the first quarter, benefiting from organic growth and favorable experience on existing treaties.
the corporate and other segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $94 million. as mentioned in our press release and slide 18 of our earnings presentation, the quarter reflected a onetime adjustment of $92 million to correct accounting for equity method limited partnerships. adjusting for that, the results were better-than-expected from our run rate and reflected lower overall expected expenses. going forward, there is the potential for additional volatility and variable investment income from the change in unrealized gains and losses on our equity method investments. moving on to investments. the non spread portfolio yield for the quarter was 5.67%, reflecting strong variable investment income. excluding the previously mentioned accounting correction, the yield was 4.52%, as we had strong contribution this quarter from the limited partnership investments.
our overall investment portfolio, average quality of a was maintained and credit impairments were negligible. as shown on slide 11 of our earnings presentation materials, our excess capital position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion. we continue to have ample liquidity as we continue to prudently manage capital during the remainder of the pandemic. rga's global platform, strong balance sheet and effective capital management strategy have been vital to rga's success during this pandemic. while we expect to have some additional covid-19 claims in 2021, we feel confident about rga's ability to produce attractive financial results in the future.
i will now turn the call over to jonathan porter, our chief risk officer, who will provide some thoughts and updates on covid-19.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
thanks, todd. as anna mentioned, q1 covid-19 general population deaths were at their highest levels in many countries, notably the u.s. and the u.k. our models continue to track well to actual results and our overall covid-19 mortality claim costs, which only include claims that we believe will ultimately be reported with the covid-19 cause of death, were within our expected range based on the level of general population deaths. the u.s. continues to be the driver of our mortality claim costs, accounting for 74% of our global total. this was approximately $17 million per 10,000 u.s. general population deaths at the lower end of our model estimates and very consistent with the prior quarter. both the u.k. and canada had q1 covid-19 mortality claim costs in excess of our model ranges, which we are attributing primarily to short-term volatility.
the u.k. and canada had a greater number of larger covid-19 claims in the quarter relative to what we saw in 2020. after considering this quarterly volatility, we are reiterating our previous rules of thumb for claim cost estimates in these markets as shown on slide 12. all other markets combined, accounted for approximately 10% of our covid-19 mortality claim costs in line with our expectations, with the majority of this coming from south africa, consistent with the high level of general population death they experienced this quarter. india accounted for less than 1% of our covid-19 claim costs in the quarter. both countries have experienced a significant level of excess mortality beyond what is being reported in general population covid-19 figures, much of which we believe is likely covid-19. since the beginning of the pandemic, over the last 12 months, south africa has accounted for approximately 5% of our covid-19 mortality claim costs and india approximately 2%. turning to longevity. our experience was positive in the quarter, driven by higher overall general population mortality in the u.k.
the majority of our q1 longevity experience is based on reporting from q4 2020 and the significant increase in u.k. general population mortality in q1 of 2021 is not yet reflected in our results. we do expect to see this impact over the next several quarters as reporting is received. going forward, the ultimate longevity offset to our global mortality claim costs may be lower than our 10% rule of thumb, given our concentration of this business in the u.k. and the success of their vaccination efforts to date. the significant reduction in general population mortality rates as vaccination levels rise in the u.s., the u.k. and canada is expected to reduce our covid-19 mortality claim costs over the remainder of 2021. at the same time, we continue to closely monitor the impact that the pandemic variants are having and countries that are at earlier stages of vaccine rollouts where higher mortality could persist for a longer period of time.
let me hand it back to todd.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. that concludes our prepared remarks. we'd now like to open it up for your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question is jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan, please go ahead.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, i just had a question, first, on your margins, especially in the european business. and i guess in the u.s. and some of the other regions, it wasn't -- the claims were sort of within or close to the ranges that you'd outlined before, obviously, worse than in 2020, but not that surprising. europe, the claims seemed a lot higher than what they had been over the past year, even if you adjust for the higher level of deaths. so can you talk about what it is that you saw there, both in sort of u.k. and outside of the u.k.? and then what your expectations are and why is it for that market? and why is it that you're not adjusting your range higher in terms of your sensitivity to covid deaths for that region?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
hi jimmy, this is jonathan. let me take that question. so for the u.k., as i mentioned, i think we believe that the primary increase this quarter is caused by larger face amount claims for covid-related deaths. so we definitely saw an increase in that in q1 versus prior quarters. if you look -- if you kind of normalize for that difference and you look sort of in aggregate across four quarters because there can just be volatility quarter-to-quarter. we are at the high end of our range or maybe slightly over, but still not materially. the other thing to keep in mind is that when we set those ranges, fx rates have moved and the u.s. dollar has weakened somewhat.
so by about 10%, i guess, versus the british pound. so that's probably causing a little bit more of the increase, too. so as far as the rest of emea, so primarily south africa this quarter, the results are really consistent with what we're seeing in the general population there. so the severity of the pandemic in south africa. has been quite high. and again, there are issues with reporting of covid deaths, we believe. so the actual number of covid deaths in the general population in south africa is in the order of magnitude of probably three times higher than what's being reported.
if you just look at excess death data, which again, is a little bit spotty to get. but that's really what's driving our results in that market is just the impact of covid-19. the -- if you look sort of at results after q1 for south africa, mortality, so far, in q2, and we're almost halfway through the quarter, is really running much lower than what we saw in q1. so there's no current surge happening in south africa and general population deaths are lower, which bodes well for the quarter.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and you mentioned this a little bit, but is it pretty much a given that the higher deaths in europe would help longevity results in the second quarter? or are there some other potential factors that will sort of go in the other direction?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. no, we do think -- we do expect to see a benefit from longevity. as i mentioned, reporting is lag there. so if you think about it, our longevity business, we've seen reporting probably extend even a little bit this quarter. so we're kind of talking four to five months on average of reporting lags. so that -- what's being reflected in our financials at this stage is really going back to probably, on average, november of last year. so -- and the large spikes we saw in the u.k. in mortality really started to happen around that time and extended into q1.
so that's why we think there's -- we do expect to see a benefit, but it will occur over the next couple of quarters. one other thing to keep in mind, too, in the u.k. is beyond covid mortality. general population excess mortality has actually been good, ex-covid. so that is potentially reducing the aggregate mortality sort of beyond what you just see in the covid numbers.
operator
okay. and our next question is from ryan krueger with kbw, please go ahead.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi, thank you. could you give us any more perspective on the magnitude of non-covid mortality that you saw in the quarter? and then, i guess, as a second part to that, i know this is a difficult question to answer, but as you study some of the underlying data on what you think might be driving non-covid mortality? how you think that may play out as we emerge out of covid.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
ryan, thanks. it's alain neemeh. let me start, i think, just a little on our quarter, and then maybe jonathan can fill in some points on covid specific mortality. i think if you back out non-covid -- sorry, covid mortality from our quarter. we think, generally speaking, our quarter was in line with our expectations. now i will say, as i think was talked about in the script, we have seen normalization of large claims in the quarter in the u.s. so we had very good, large claims volatility the last couple of quarters. that's normalized this quarter. we've also seen some level of excess claims, which isn't inconsistent with what we've seen throughout the pandemic.
so we've got covid specific mark claims, and then you've got an excess amount that likely is, directly or indirectly, related to that. so we've seen some of that and then given the spiking claims toward the end of last year, i think we also saw some claims come into this quarter. so i think when you back all that out, though, we're feeling pretty good about the underlying business. and i would say, certainly, over the last year and even this quarter, our results are very much in line with what we would have expected.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. and then maybe i'll just add alain just specific -- more specific to covid itself. so we talked about south africa already. but again, that's similar phenomenon, we're seeing with significantly lower general population deaths that is happening in -- or quarter-over-quarter in the u.s. and the u.k. for sure as well. so just -- the u.k. has had about less than 1,000, i think, as of yesterday, covid marked death in q2, and that's versus 53,000 that happened in q1. so we are seeing reductions in some of our larger markets, which is good news.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. i mean, as a follow-up. i think generally, the prevailing thought was that after a pandemic general population mortality would improve for some period of time, given the pull forward of deaths. seems like there's more uncertainty this time around, given some of the other effects that maybe covid and putting off doctor visits and things like that could have. what are your latest thoughts on that topic?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. i mean, i think you're exactly right. there's some pluses and minuses, and it's really not clear at this point yet what that effect will be. so as you mentioned, one of the potential negatives is people delaying diagnosis of -- by not going to the doctor and being diagnosed with conditions at a later stage, which could be more severe.
on the other hand, you also mentioned the acceleration effect, which we do think will have some beneficial impact, potentially modest, but it will be positive. then you also think about things like vaccine technology, developments, people's just behavior, social distancing, we saw that in the flu season this year. so those could also be positives, but i think it will take some time for the data to play out.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is humphrey lee with dowling & partners, please go ahead.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. my first question is just to follow-up on the non-covid u.s. mortality piece. you talked about this reporting lag and then i assume there may be some adverse developments. can you size that impact for this quarter?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
yes, sure. i mean, in terms of the question sort of reporting like an adverse impacts, i think it's more just a little bit of reporting lag, and that's largely related to the big flux of claims or big influx of claims that we saw toward the end of last year. in terms of sizing it, tens of millions, thereabouts.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
okay. because you did put -- sorry, because you did put up ibnr reserve of $100 million at the end of the quarter last -- i mean, last quarter. so clearly, it blew pass that. so that's the driver. and i guess maybe exiting first quarter, where do you stand in terms of ibnr reserves?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, humphrey...
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
go ahead, todd.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. humphrey, it's todd. yes, we did set up the ibnr at the end of the year. we took the best information that we had and made the best estimate that we had, and it was reasonable, we thought at the time. as alain mentioned, there was a pretty significant acceleration of deaths that toward the end of the year as we all saw. so we missed it by a little, but that's not unusual. the quarterly ibnr, either are below or above where you need to be, and that's just an ongoing fact.
and again, given the volume of deaths that were out there toward the end of the year, we just understated it a little bit. and then again, for first quarter, we, again, looked at the information that we had available to us and reset what we thought the appropriate ibnr balance is for the end of the first quarter. now it would have come down a little bit, given that the number of deaths, if you will, has come down since -- as you got toward the end of the quarter.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
got it. and my --
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
humphrey. sorry. it's anna. if i can -- i want to step back for a minute. and i want to make sure that when we talk about our performance over the last 12 months, adjusted for covid, and it's been in line that we appreciate what that includes. so in the last 12 months in the u.s. there have been approximately 550,000 deaths reported, covid deaths reported. but in addition to those deaths, there's been roughly 150,000 excess deaths, not specifically identified as covid.
now we believe those access are likely covid-related, directly or indirectly and likely temporary in nature as we come out of the pandemic. when we say, we adjust our business. we're only adjusting for the impact of the 550,000 specific deaths. that means our business is wearing the other 150,000 deaths. i just want to make sure that, that's clear. so to me, that's a signal of good performance over the course of the last 12 months.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that color. my follow-up question is you talked about -- in the prepared remarks, you talked about the exposure to india, and it has only been 1% -- 2% of your claim cost to date. but given the spike in deaths over there, and i recall, you had a $20 million impact in the fourth quarter. like how should we think about that going into the second quarter, given the much worse numbers that's coming through right now.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes, humphrey, this is jonathan. so first, let me just caveat with coming up with the claims cost sort of the estimate for india, just given the situation with sort of the availability of data as well as just the very kind of current nature of what's happening in that country with respect to the third stopping, it's difficult.
since that information is still developing, and considering what's happened to us in the past, i think if we had to put a number or a range on it, we're thinking of it sort of in the $50 million to $100 million pre-tax range. but again, there's a very wide range of a funnel of doubt or account of doubt around those numbers, just given the situation and how it's developing.
operator
and our next question is from erik bass, autonomous research, please go ahead.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi, thank you. so i think you ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of excess capital, and you sound pretty optimistic of return to profitability and kind of good or improving performance going forward. so just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the level of excess capital and your comfort level in drawing that down. and going forward, whether it's for block m&a or at some point, potentially returning to shareholders?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
erik, it's todd. we continue to prudently manage the capital throughout the pandemic. i think as you've seen historically, we have balanced deployment into the transactions where we can obtain good returns and we like the underlying risk profile, the dividend level and then also done some share repurchases over time. i think we still need some more time to pass here and more certainty to come into view, but we'll continue to follow a prudent and balanced capital management approach.
we did deploy $100 million of capital in the first quarter, as anna mentioned in her comments. and we were comfortable with that. it was a very nice underlying profile of liabilities, a very stable long-term cash flows. it was a follow-on transactions with an important client in asia and had some other benefits as well. so i think we'll continue to be prudent as we continue to work through this pandemic period, but we'll continue to evaluate what the best alternatives and opportunities are for the capital deployment.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you. and then we've seen a surge in demand for term life, particularly in the middle market in recent quarters. i'm just wondering, are you capturing much of this business? and maybe how are you seeing the growth outlook in u.s. traditional kind of for this year and as we move past the pandemic?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
erik, it's alain neemeh. no, you're quite right. i think we are seeing some very good production. in fact, interestingly, mib, i think, just came out with some statistics that show a record level of application activity in the month of march and very strong q1 results, and that's not just over last year, but over pre-pandemic type quarters. so i think that's wonderful to see. we've talked about in the past.
an expectation, maybe a hope, to some extent, but an expectation that we would see a resurgence in desire or thinking about life insurance from people in the general population. so we're certainly seeing that now. i'd say as we look ahead, it's difficult to say whether this is, call it, a new, sustained level of business or whether it's maybe a little bit of catch-up, a little bit of return to normalcy. so clearly, we'll follow that along. but as we've talked about as well previously, companies -- direct companies have invested significantly accelerated investments in digital efforts and distribution efforts to try and get to that middle market. so it seems to be paying dividends, and we're certainly quite excited by what we're seeing.
operator
and our next question is andrew kligerman with credit suisse, please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning everyone. sorry to continue on this indirect non-covid-19 question, but help me out a little bit on the math because it's not clear to me. so ex-covid effects in u.s. and latam, you would have been at negative $55 million. if life were normal, which is not, i'd say we'd be at a base of maybe 170 -- maybe $110 million, $120 million of earnings. so what that tells me is that these -- what you may believe to be non-covid, but indirectly related, it's half the level of the covid claims. and then i'm looking at a -- and that was very helpful. and is 150,000 of excess deaths against the total of 550 and it's much smaller.
so i guess maybe could you help think through this issue, was it a frequency issue this quarter? was it a severity issue this quarter? and ultimately, what should the run rate earnings be, assuming none of this challenging very difficult situation with covid-19 were occurring?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
andrew, i guess -- alain neemeh, here. i'll take a stab at this first. a couple of comments to make. i think, first of all, backing out covid claims and then looking at the rest, i think i'd start by saying there's certainly some impact from non-covid labels, but likely related type claims. that would be #1. we have had some slippage, as i mentioned, from last quarter into this quarter. and then maybe the only other thing i'd say, it's very difficult to talk about a run rate on any one quarter. certainly, when we look back over the last number of years, we see a certain level of seasonality in our business.
just because we have a lower flu season doesn't necessarily mean that all of that seasonality goes away because seasonality has to do with weather, time of year as well as some input from the flu. so look, i would say, i think we're probably around call it, $300 million annually on traditional. but as we look at this quarter, it's difficult to talk about a run rate for first quarter. but certainly, i would say when we look at the underlying business, we're pretty happy with what's transpired this quarter.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just maybe -- i think todd was touching on australia being breakeven, but then he said there's still some uncertainty. so i just want to make sure i understand what that potential uncertainty might be?
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
yes. so look, it's alain, again. i think if i look back over the last few years, we certainly talked about some issues in the underlying market with respect to terms and conditions and level of competitiveness in new business. and so i think you wouldn't be surprised that we've seen our business volumes come down. and in fact, when we look at this quarter over first quarter last year, we're seeing a significant reduction in premiums. that has to do with two super fund reinsurance treaties that we had, that are no longer on our books, one of which, just as a matter of interest, the underlying client would have lost. but the other one, we couldn't come to terms on the reinsurance business as it came for renewal. so we're continuing to be cautious.
i think when we talk about a certain level of uncertainty it has a lot to do with the fact that we're looking at products and terms and conditions in new products, and we're looking to see them get back to a level of normalcy that we'd like to see. i think i talked last quarter about individual di standards coming into play as regulated by the regulator in october. so i think that will be good news. but i think some of it also has to do. when we look back over the last year, we've been more or less right around breakeven every quarter, which i think is certainly an improvement over prior couple of years. there's still some maybe caution around disability claims and potential mental illness. now australia has had better results with respect to the pandemic. but they've also had more shutdowns. so i think it's -- i think a type of thing, we're simply just being cautious about in all of our markets. but i would say we're feeling better about our australia business for sure.
the next step, though, is to see new products get to a point where we get excited about them and then potentially start to put new business back on. but for now, still that cautious approach todd was alluding to. i hope that answers your question.
operator
your next question is dan bergman with citi, please go ahead.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i guess to start, maybe just following up on excess capital. it looked like your excess capital only declined by around $100 million in the first quarter versus the year-end 2020 level despite absorbing, i think, almost $500 million of covid claims and deploying $100 million into block deals. so i was hoping you could give some more color on the offsets that allowed for that strong result? and if there's any benefit in your capital model from that accounting change on the lp investments? and maybe just finally on that, going forward, with covid claims seemingly likely to decline materially post the first quarter. should we be expecting an inflection on the capital side with excess capital likely starting to build from here before factoring in capital deployment, block deals or repurchases, etc.?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, dan, it's todd. we actually had positive net income for the quarter. i think it was around $139 million. so we actually added capital from that perspective. i mean we had some -- no capital gains in that number for repositioning some of the investment portfolio. also, as you mentioned, we did have some positive impact in there from the correction for the accounting for the limited partnerships. so that's where -- even though we deployed some capital, it's still -- overall, it declined by about $100 million for the quarter.
and then we continue to evaluate what should that level of excess be as we emerge from covid, and we're still looking through that, but i do feel that we will be at a place where we'll find a and follow a very effective and balanced approach to how we, over time, manage the capital base. i think, as you know, we don't true it up each quarter. quarter-to-quarter, we do look at it more over a longer period of time given the nature of our long-term business.
dan bergman -- citi -- analyst
got it. that's helpful, thanks. and then i know you reiterated your prior covid claims sensitivity guidance, but i wanted to see if there are any additional thoughts you can provide around how the vaccination program might impact covid claims or sensitivities going forward. for example, should we be expecting a material difference in vaccination rates between the general and insured populations?
and then also just with the timing of older, higher risk populations generally getting the vaccine earlier. could that impact near-term claims trends or sensitivities, could some of the mortality over the next several quarters be skewed toward younger individuals versus what we've seen early in pandemic. maybe a little bit of a broad question, but any thoughts on that would be great.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. dan, it's jonathan. so just sort of give a couple of points on this. so i think generally speaking, we would expect our rules of thumb to still be applicable as vaccinations programs are rolled out. so as general population mortality declines, our insurance population will decline. and that's not going to be a perfect match. but at a macro level, i think it will sort of track reasonably well. and as we see data emerge, obviously, we'll update those rules of thumbs. as required. i think to your point about kind of will it be more mortality in different age groups. i kind of think of it as we're essentially eliminating mortality in some age groups. so sort of by definition, that means it will be more proportionate in the groups that have not had the full vaccination.
so it's not really a shift in my mind. it's more just -- we're getting rid of some excess mortality for those age groups and people that have been vaccinated, which -- and the residual mortality will still be there for the other age group. so yes, we might see something that looks a little different by population components. but again, overall, i think it's because aggregate mortality is going down and our rules of thumb would suggest that we'll see the same results on our books.
operator
and our next question is from john barnidge with piper sandler, please go ahead.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. can you talk about directionality of session rates broadly that you've seen maybe across geographies. i ask that because the traditional business got some top line growth in the quarter.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
sure, john. alain neemeh. look, i would say, generally speaking, we haven't seen any movement on session rates per se. so our business volumes have very much been driven by the level of new business at the direct company level, and we've seen our share of reinsurance commitment.
now i say that recognizing that with every market and every client in each of those markets, there are reinsurance pools, and we participate on some, not all, and with varying degrees of percentages per pool. those typically will fluctuate year-to-year as new products come out. but generally speaking, i would say, if i understand your question correctly, the level of section rates has generally stayed the same in all of the markets and our positioning has remained quite consistent.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you, and then follow-up. on the excess mortality, just briefly, is it one of these things where it was a covid claim they didn't make it of a hospital? or is it similar to the flu and that the flu was the first step that started the decay process into death sadly? just trying to dimension between those 2.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president chief operating officer
look, i would say, very tough to tell this early on. i think -- i mean, jonathan may have a little bit more information than i. but these are, in many cases, hot off the press already for covid-type deaths, we're needing to, i'll say, average up from the perspective that our cause of death reporting, isn't yet complete this early after a quarter end.
so when we talk about excess deaths, we're really relating it to what we're seeing in the general population, relating it to what we've seen in the last few quarters. but it's difficult, i think, from my perspective, to get that granular, but i don't know if any one of my colleagues, anything to add to that.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. i mean i think, alain, you're right. when we look back sort of over time, where the data is more complete. i mean, clearly, we saw excess mortality beyond what was explained by covid in the u.s., specifically i'm talking about now in 2020. so it's not unreasonable to expect that it would continue. clearly, flu deaths have been minimal or almost 0. so that would be an offset to that. but the net of the two still seems to be a drag.
operator
our next question is mike ward with ubs, please go ahead.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
thanks guys, good morning. i'm just trying to think about high level earnings power. as you touched on the average 1q earnings for u.s. and latam, i think, is really breakeven over the last several years because of that 1q seasonality. so if we're thinking post-covid 2022, i'm not asking for guidance, but at a high level, if you think about your kind of earnings power for '22 and beyond today versus before covid, has anything really changed at all?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
mike, it's todd. no, that's sort of the way i was going to sort of frame it, if you go back to pre-covid, we had a very diversified, both globally and product-wise, earnings profile where -- it's called -- half came from our traditional business as far as bottom line and half from the global financial solutions. and throughout covid, the global financial solutions business has continued to perform very well. so as we emerge post-covid and things get back to, i'll call it, more normal we're very confident our underlying business, if you will, and our relationships with our clients and so on, it's still very much intact. so we would be optimistic that we could get back to those pre-covid earnings levels and then continue on as we were pre-covid.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, and then just to expand on the capital discussion. i guess, if there's going to be a fraction of global covid deaths this quarter in 2q, and covid really is close to being fully in the rearview mirror, and you did an equity raise last year for covid. your stock is, of course, pretty attractive. so i guess what would be stopping you from really ramping up back capital return in a bigger way?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes to go back to my comments, earlier, we're going to prudently manage the capital so that we don't have to raise capital in the future as well. so we're going to keep a close eye on it and look at what opportunities are out there from the business perspective and what type of attractive returns and underlying transaction types that potentially are. and as we did pre-covid, we'll lay that against the various alternatives as we look at how we want to deploy capital going forward. that -- i don't think we want to get too far out ahead of ourselves.
operator
and our next question is from tom gallagher with evercore, please go ahead.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
hi. appreciated the color on the india sensitivity. my question is, are there any other countries, in particular, you're keeping a closer eye on where mortality is worsening right now, like brazil or i don't think you have much exposure there, but i'm just trying to get a sense, are there any other areas that we should be considering here?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. tom, it's jonathan. so obviously, as you say, it's a pretty dynamic situation. we're monitoring all of our business, clearly. given the current circumstances, though, there's nothing significant from what we already talked about. so outside of india, the pandemic is in asia, the pandemic is still being very well controlled, i think, in those markets in australia. latin america, i think the way you characterize it is correct.
there are some global hotspot issues in latin america. but based on the size of our business, which is quite modest and the nature of it. so it's almost entirely annually renewable business. it also is a very large health component and the relatively limited impacts we've seen there to date. so latin america, in total, has represented about 1% of our inception-to-date mortality and morbidity impacts. we don't have a specific concern about those markets right now.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
got you. okay. and then how much -- just a follow-up question on ibnr. how much ibnr did you book as a percentage of your total claims for covid in q1, if you could quantify that.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president global chief risk officer
yes. so it's jonathan, again. so what -- you kind of have to think about ibnr, it's really a balance, correct. so there is movement in the quarter. so as todd mentioned earlier, because the mortality rates came down in q1 from what we saw in q4, our ibnr balance actually decreased over the course of the quarter.
if you look at our covid specific ibnr that we still have on our books, it's probably in the order of magnitude for both mortality and morbidity of about usd120 million, give or take. that's in addition to all of our regular ibnr we would hold for our normal course business.
operator
it appears that there are no further questions at this time. mr. todd larson, i'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional closing remarks.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
good day, and welcome to the reinsurance group of america second quarter 2021 results conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to introduce mr. todd larson, senior executive vice president, and chief financial officer, and ms. anna manning, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead, mr. larson.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. good morning and welcome to rga's second quarter 2021 conference call. with me this morning on the call is anna manning, rga's president and chief executive officer, alain neemeh, chief operating officer, leslie barbi, our chief investment officer, jonathan porter, chief risk officer and jeff hopson, head of investor relations. we will discuss the second quarter results after a quick reminder about forward-looking information and non-gaap financial measures. following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from expected results. please refer to the earnings release we issued yesterday for a list of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. additionally, during the course of this call information we provide may include non-gaap financial measures. please see our earnings release, earnings presentation, quarterly financial supplement in website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to gaap measures. now, i'll turn the call over to anna for her comments.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, todd. good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. last night, we reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $4. i'm very pleased with these results as we delivered an excellent quarter even in the face of continuing covid-19 claims. the covid-19 impact in the quarter was material although at much reduced levels than in the first quarter and notably the performance of the rest of our business was more than enough to absorb these costs and deliver the strong quarter we had. this quarter once again provides evidence of the strength of our underlying earnings power. the value of our diversified business and the resilience of our global platform. i'm also very proud of the way that the rga team has responded during the pandemic. our client-centric solution-oriented approach combined with disciplined execution has proven itself over time, and serves us well. this strategy helps us compete and win. in the quarter, we were very active and successful on new business opportunities in both our organic business and on in-force block transactions. turning to some of the highlights of the quarter, our gfs business performed extremely well across all our regions and lines of business. in the quarter, we deployed $200 million into in-force transactions, including the modern woodmen transaction that we publicly announced. the transaction pipeline remains [technical issues] with opportunities in all our regions. our traditional business also performed well overall. as covid-19 claims, were significantly reduced and non-covid-19 experience was at or better than our expectations across all our segments. the u.s. individual mortality business had a good quarter as the covid-19 impact was lower than expected and non-covid-19 experience was in line with our expectations. the u.s. group and u.s. individual health businesses, both performed above our expectations. overall investment performance was very good, and our new money rate increased slightly despite lower market yields. impairments were minimal and we realized some nice gains in our limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures.
australia reported a modest profit in the quarter, which is a continuation of the more favorable trend over the last 6 quarters, reported premium growth was very good, organic growth was solid, and new business momentum has picked up and is encouraging. and we increased the quarterly dividend and have lifted the previous suspension of share repurchases. good indications of the health and future prospects for our business.
looking forward, we expect covid-19 claims to continue over the near term, but at manageable and decreasing levels. vaccinations continue to provide very good protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death, which should mitigate the impact of future waves. given the vaccine levels in all our key markets of the us, the u.k. and canada, we expect covid-19 claims to decline in the second half of the year. in india and south africa, we will likely see some continuation in covid-19 claims through the remainder of the year but at manageable levels. jonathan will provide more specific thoughts on this shortly.
in closing, i am very pleased with the quarter. we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and capital levels and with positive business fundamentals. we see encouraging signs and increasing momentum on new business. capital deployment into transactions of $300 million through the first half is an excellent start to the quarter -- so an excellent start to the year.
we believe there is reason for optimism. as we look ahead and as such we expect to resume our balance and effective capital management strategy in the coming quarters. we look forward to continuing to deliver attractive financial results and to building on our long-term track record of performance.
thank you for your interest in rga, i hope you all remain safe and stay well. let me now turn it over to todd to go over the detailed financial results.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, anna. rga reported $361 million of pre-tax adjusted operating income for the quarter and adjusted operating earnings per share of $4, which includes a negative covid-19 impact of $1.44 per share. our trailing 12 months adjusted operating return on equity is 5.7% which was net of covid-19 impacts of 6.9%. these results are evidence of the strength of our underlying earnings power and resilience of our global platform as anna highlighted in her remarks. consolidated premiums increased 11% in the quarter and 7% on a constant currency basis. in the us, the underlying growth in premiums was solid and this segment also benefited from a modification of the treaty renewal. the emea segment premium growth reflects good new business wins, and in asia we have started to see new business activity pick up.
australia premiums declined from a combination of actions on underperforming treaties and remaining selective on new business opportunities. the effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating income was 24% for the quarter, in line with our expected range of 23% to 24%.
turning to the segment results listed on slides 7 and 8 of our earnings presentation, starting with the u.s. segment. the us and latin america traditional segment had a very good quarter absorbing covid-19 claims cost of approximately $57 million. let me provide a little more detail on the results. for u.s. individual mortality, approximately $45 million of claim costs were attributed to covid-19 which was below the range for our rules of thumb based on the number of general population deaths. this was primarily due to a lower average size of the covid-19 claims. non-covid-19 claims were in line with expectations and it was a fairly straightforward quarter in terms of large claims experience.
the u.s. group and individual health businesses both performed better than our expectations due to favorable experience in the disability and healthcare access lines. variable investment income was strong in the quarter as both limited partnership performance and real estate joint venture realizations were favorable. the u.s. asset-intensive business reported very strong results, the segment had favorable overall experience, including some transaction and other fees, favorable longevity experience and equity markets and higher variable investment income from commercial loan prepayments. we are very happy with the results in the quarter. we still believe that at normal run rate is 60 million to 65 million as some of the variable items in the quarter are not expected to repeat on a regular basis.
moving to the canadian segment, the canada traditional segment results reflected covid-19 claim cost of approximately $21 million higher than our expected range based on the number of general population deaths. non-covid-19 experience was favorable. the canada financial solutions segment was in line with our expectations for the quarter.
in the europe, middle east, and africa segment, the traditional business results reflected covid-19 claim cost of approximately $35 million in total of which $19 million was in the u.k. and $12 million in south africa. non-covid-19 experience was favorable.
emea's financial solutions had a strong quarter as business results reflected favorable longevity experience in the quarter.
turning to our asia pacific traditional business, asia results reflect covid-19 claim costs of approximately $55 million of which approximately $51 million was in india. non-covid-19 experience was favorable across the segment. australia reported a modest profit for the quarter. we are pleased with the ongoing progress in australia and remain focused on actions to improve results. we're also taking a disciplined approach to new business.
asia-pacific financial solutions business continued to produce good results in the second quarter, reflecting favorable experience on existing treaties and contributions from recent transactions.
the corporate and other segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $39 million. the loss was higher than our quarterly average run rate, primarily due to lower investment income. we expect some volatility quarter to quarter in this segment and continue to believe on average a quarterly estimate of $25 million loss is appropriate.
moving to investments, the non-spread portfolio yield for the quarter was 4.64%, reflecting strong variable investment income, primarily due to realizations from limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures. while hard to predict from a timing perspective, they are core part of our investment earnings. investment credit impairments were nominal for the quarter and we continue to see results below the low end of our stress scenarios. our new money rate of 3.5% was higher than the first quarter rate of 3.35% reflecting stronger private asset production.
related to capital management, as shown on slide 11 of our presentation materials, our excess capital position at the end of the quarter remained unchanged at approximately $1.2 billion, our strong net income funded transaction deployment of $200 million of capital and solid organic growth. we've maintained a prudent capital management approach throughout the pandemic recognizing our strong underlying business fundamentals. our excess capital position and the expectation of reducing levels of covid-19 cost going forward, we have increased the quarterly dividend by 4% from $0.70 per quarter to $0.73 per quarter and lifted the suspension of the share buybacks.
i will now turn the call over to jonathan porter, our chief risk officer, who will provide additional comments on our covid-19 related experience.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
thanks, todd. as shown on slide 5, covid-19 claim costs of $168 million decreased significantly in the quarter as vaccination roll-outs continued and general population deaths in our major markets were down materially from their q1 peak levels. the u.s., u.k. and canada accounted for just over 50% of covid 19 claim costs this quarter. this is a lower proportion of the total than in prior quarters, but was expected given the relative levels of vaccinations in these markets. the balance of our global covid-19 claim costs were driven by higher general population deaths in india and south africa. as the impact of vaccinations is becoming better understood and claims data continues to develop, we are updating our estimated rules of thumb for future claim costs. in the u.s., we have updated the models to reflect the relative progress of vaccination programs as well as consideration of our claims experience. this has resulted in a lowering of our u.s. range for future claim costs of $10 million to $20 million for every 10,000 general population deaths. we're also widening our estimated ranges to $10 million to $20 million for canada and $4 million to $8 million for the u.k. these adjustments reflect emerging claims experience, the possibility of more relative quarterly variability as population deaths decrease due to vaccination progress and the weakening of the us dollar since we set rules of thumb last year.
our longevity experience was favorable this quarter with a pre-tax benefit of $38 million. this was driven primarily by lag reporting in the u.k. where our longevity business is concentrated reflecting higher covid 19 general population deaths from prior quarters. given the success of the u.k vaccination program and the expectation of low covid-19 deaths through the rest of the year, we would expect to see more modest longevity benefits in future quarters.
real world data is consistently demonstrating that vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe outcomes and death through covid-19 variance. we believe this will continue to drive lower general population mortality and therefore lower claim costs in the u.s., u.k. and canada. this has been demonstrated with the recent delta variant surge in the u.k. where daily case counts were close to the prior wave peak but deaths were less than 10% of the prior high point.
in our markets with lower vaccination levels like india and south africa, we would expect to see some continuation of covid-19 claims, but we believe at manageable levels given the mature -- sorry given the nature and size of our business in those countries. we also expect the impact of future waves will be dampened as vaccination levels continue to rise in these markets. i'll hand it back to todd.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. before opening it up for questions, i would like to mention that we will hold a virtual investor meeting on december 9 and hope to have you join us for that discussion. with that, we'll now open it up for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. we will now take our first question from jimmy bhullar of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. so first, i just had a question on your announcement of resuming buybacks, should we assume buybacks in the 3rd quarter or are you waiting for the pandemic to abate further before you start doing it, and any sort of color on the magnitude of potential buybacks over the next year would be helpful as well.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. jimmy, we've -- if you look at our history, we've always followed a prudent and balanced capital management approach over time, we don't try to fine tune capital quarter to quarter. we're in a very long-term business, and that's also how we view -- how we manage the company, including capital and i think if you look at our history as well we've done a pretty balanced job in deploying capital into in-force transactions when we'd like the liabilities and you can get an appropriate return on the transactions, funding our organic growth, maintaining nice stream of dividends year after year and then balancing it out with share repurchases. while we're not out of the pandemic yet, we are more confident as jonathan was mentioning that the vaccines are protecting more against hospitalizations and ultimate deaths, which is a good sign, we feel we've got a strong earnings power across our various business segments. so we are comfortable at this time lifting the share repurchase suspension and we'll continue to manage capital over time as we view those different alternatives and consider other items.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
but you're not willing to comment on whether or not you'll do buybacks in the 3rd quarter or when you will actually resume activity.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
i wouldn't say we have a definitive time at this point.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then on the...
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
jimmy. can i -- can i just add a couple of comments, please. yeah, i would just reiterate we feel good about our business. we're committed to the balanced capital management approach that todd outlined where we're going to look for the best and the most valuable use of our capital and that's going to include share buybacks over time. we've demonstrated that if you go back and look at our approach, i think, we've done a good job and we expect to do that going forward.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, i would, because the reason is you did raise equity and in addition to having that capital you've been profitable throughout the pandemic on not every quarter, but overall and i doubt that there is any new business opportunity that has that type of roe or return that your buybacks would -- that you would get from buybacks at the current stock price. but the other reason i was asking is, you have resumed -- resumed, i would assume means that you're going to -- or lifting the suspension would mean that you're going to start buying back as opposed to just starting to evaluate potential buyback. so, i wasn't sure where you stood in that respect. well, but the other question i had -- go on.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
no, no. please, your other question.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. yeah, i was just going to ask on india, you had i think $51 million you mentioned in claims. should we assume that there is a fairly high ibnr component in there, because, or is it just the actual claims that were submitted to you and the reason for asking that is, that should your losses in india follow what's going on in the market in terms of mortality or is there a lag to where even if mortality begin or once mortality begins to improve you will show an improvement later, just given the reporting lag.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah. hi, jimmy. this is jonathan. so that $51 million includes ibnr, it's about 60% or so of that $51 million is ibnr, so we have not full claims reporting yet. so as you mentioned, the idea with the ibnr is we accrue up to claims that we think we've incurred, but have not been reported yet as of the end of the quarter. so we're trying to sync that up with what's happening in the general population.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from humphrey lee of dowling and partners. please go ahead.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my questions. my first question is related to u.s. and latin america traditional. if we were to add back the covid related impact earnings would have been $190 million. clearly a meaningful portion of the favorable vii would be in this segment. but just can you talk about and size the other favorability that you had in the quarter.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi humphrey, it's todd. we saw some of favorability, you mentioned the variable income and certainly that was a portion of it, but we also saw it in our group and individual health line as well. remember the group line is the line we went through a pretty comprehensive repricing exercise a couple of years ago, we might have lost a little bit of new business there, but the profitability has continued to be good, so really it was across the board and a piece of it was the variable investment income. i was just going to add important to note, i think our ex covid our us individual claims performance was good, which sort of continues a string of pretty good quarters from covid.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
thanks. but i was just wondering, can you size the -- the benefit for the vii and the group and health benefits.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the vii, these are rough numbers probably, but it was probably for the traditional business that was probably in the neighborhood of $40 million, $42 million or so and that's pre-tax, above the -- above what we would say the average run rate would be. and then i think group and individual health we're somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
that's helpful. and then my second question is while i understand maybe a little premature, but can you just talk about the outlook for potential covid-19 impact for the 3rd quarter, especially for the countries that you don't have, you don't provide sensitivity, like south africa and india.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, hi humphrey. it's jonathan. so obviously we continue to closely monitor the spread of the delta variant. but as we mentioned, we're pretty optimistic that success of vaccination programs will result in maintaining that effectiveness against severe outcome and death. so, so far this quarter, the general population deaths in the u.s., the u.k. and canada remained at relatively modest levels again that example of the u.k demonstration of case counts are not as closely linked to of mortality as we've seen in the past. so we also believe that based on socioeconomic data in the us that the insurance population take-up rate of vaccinations is likely a little bit higher than the general population, which is part of the reason why we lowered our rules of thumb. for india and south africa, the vaccination rates are lower, so we still expect to see some impact in the coming quarters. india right now, the daily deaths are in the general population are about 15% of what they were at the peak of the prior wave, which is good for this quarter. south africa, case counts were going up at the end of the quarter. they appeared to have peaked in early july and are coming down now from the most recent wave and deaths also seemed to have peaked at about 75% of what they were in the past. so again those are two good signs in those markets as well.
and again, given the nature and size of our business in those markets, we think that future claims will still be at a manageable level for us.
operator
we'll take our next question from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. hey, good morning. and just staying on that topic. and i think earlier in the call. i heard you mention that despite the delta variant, vaccinations should prevent deaths, maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on that, it seems like you're very confident, one company earlier kind of updates its estimate for mortality claims. so just maybe a little more color around the delta variant and what you're seeing globally.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, sure, andrew. so again, when we look at, there are multiple studies not just one set of data, so the real life example i mentioned from the u.k., but data from public health england, new england journal of medicine, the cdc reporting that's recently come out at the end of july. they all point to very high degrees of effectiveness still for the vaccinations against the delta variant. so again, we think that will make the -- or limit or dampen the impact of higher case counts just because mortality should be quite a bit reduced. and again, as we talked about already two in markets with lower vaccination levels, there will be more potential for those variance to have a larger impact although and other thing to keep in mind is that india has gone through the delta wave already over the first delta wave, so that's not yet to come there. and we do think that the increasing levels of vaccinations in those countries even though they are low at this point, will keep improving and will result in a dampening effect as well in the future.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
andrew, i can just add a comment. yeah. maybe to add one other comment andrew, in terms of our business and how what we're seeing out there translates into our business very complex lots of factors, underwriting, socioeconomic and what other companies are seeing is going to very much depend on the nature of their underlying business whether it's individual or whether it's group, so i wouldn't draw two direct line between those two.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. very, very helpful. and then with regard to overall premium growth,very, very robust net premium growth of 11%, but then probably a few adjust for fx and some other unusuals. maybe it was 4%, which is still very good premium growth. could you talk about each of your key regions and what kind of premium growth you're expecting over the near and intermediate term.
alain p. neemeh -- senior executive vice president, chief operating officer
and andrew it's alain neemeh, why don't i take a stab at that. maybe i'll talk a little bit about business volumes as opposed to premium growth just because of a lot of factors that impact premium growth as you mentioned, foreign currency, there is also lumpiness in client reporting at times. there is also the type of structure on which we reinsure, for example, whether it's yrt or co-insurance but generally speaking, i think if we sort of go around the world we're feeling pretty good about our business, certainly in the u.s., we're seeing a meaningful uptick in our production numbers. now whether that's -- i'll say pent-up demand coming through or a new level of sustained activity, i think remains to be seen, but we're certainly seeing better production at the direct company level and that's translating into better reinsurance production for us. canada again, similar story to the u.s. where we've got very good business production coming through and that's reflected in reinsurance. in asia. i think todd alluded to it in his comments, we are seeing some good activity there. i think in the sort of hong kong, china region there still, we're still a little bit down in terms of production numbers but and it's mainly because a lot of our business in hong kong is chinese main landers that come across, but generally speaking, good new business. i think there is room to do more.
in emea, we're seeing good production levels and maybe the only area where still a little bit cautious is in australia, where we're looking to see some rehabilitation and product terms and conditions, which by the way i should add, we're expecting to see later this year the regulator there has come out with defined in terms and conditions on individual business and that takes hold october 1st and so we're starting to see evidence of signs of change there. so all in all, and i think anna mentioned earlier, just from a gfs standpoint right across the board good level of activity certainly good deals done in the first half of the year and all in all, i would say some strong optimism for production in the next half of the year.
operator
we'll now take our next question from erik bass of autonomous research. please go ahead.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi, thank you. i just wanted to come back to the u.s. asset-intensive segment. i think todd you talked about $60 million to $65 million is still being kind of a normal earnings run rate for that segment. if i'm just wondering, should that a little bit higher over time given the modern woodmen transaction is that earns in.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, again it was a very strong quarter for the u.s. asset-intensive segment for the reasons -- we went through, i guess, one thing we didn't touch upon the comments is that we also have over time amortization of the existing portfolio, because that annuity blocks run down over time and that could be 5% to 10% a year or so is a very rough estimate. so adding the transaction we did this last quarter helps offset some of that natural amortization over time. so again a very strong quarter. but as we look through it very pleased with the result but still feel sitting here right now that $60 million to $65 million is probably a reasonable estimate and hopefully will come at the high end and beat it.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then maybe if you could talk a little bit about the outlook for the transactional environment in the second half of the year. obviously, a good start to the year with #300 million deployed. but if you can talk about what level -- types of activity you're seeing and thinking both from rga's perspective, but also if there is anything that kind of falls into [phonetic] langhornes, [phonetic]wheel house.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let me, let me address that question. so i'd start by saying pipelines are very good in all our regions. starting maybe with the asia region asset intensive pipeline, the pipeline is good. you saw that in our first quarter,the deal that we completed in the first quarter within that region. we are seeing a few more competitors there, but we believe we have some advantages, which can help us win and are helping us win. we have long-standing relationships as we've been in those markets for many, many years, that also means that we're familiar with and we understand the products, the risks, the regulatory environment. some competitors are still getting operational in some of these markets, so we think -- we think we're well positioned there. in the u.s., the asset intensive pipeline is also very good. competition is strong and there are a lot more competitors there. deal sizes vary. as you saw in the second quarter with the announced deal that we did where we may not fair share. we're also working on the langhorne deal, so specifically to your question. and we're optimistic about completing langhorne transactions.
and then, and on the longevity and prt opportunities, again pipeline is good. in the u.k., netherlands, there are some sizable transactions. there are competitors. but again, we feel good about the business because in part our underwriting expertise and they're really part of the sweet spot of deals that we focus on. so i would say, again, we feel good about the business and we're optimistic as we look forward.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thanks. you didn't touch on kind of biometric pipeline some mortality, morbidity, are you seeing blocks there, it does seem like there is more interest at least in the u.s. from some companies in terms of transacting legacy lifelock.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i should have added that you're exactly right. there are deals and sizable deals with underlying insurance risks, again from you need more than just the asset expertise on those blocks, you really need the underwriting expertise and we are very strong in that respect.

we'll take our next question from john barnidge of piper sandler. please go ahead.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. the delayed longevity benefits certainly seems to derive in the second quarter, is there any way to get a sense for average date of death for that longevity benefit that occurred, just to get a sense of how we should think about in the 3rd quarter, thank you.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, hi, john, this is jonathan. i don't have an exact number to give you as far as dates go, but i think it's fair to say that generally speaking the experience we're seeing in this quarter is probably lagged about 4 to 5 months on average. so most of the experience in q2 would have been from reporting in q4 and q1.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, great. and then can you talk about, you talked about group health and individual health that there have been some favorable claims tailwinds and that was repriced in 2019. can you talk about the expectations around durability of that do you view any of that changing claims behavior is somewhat semi-permanent in nature.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, john, todd. no, that business does -- generally repriced on an annual basis or so we can stay close -- close to the claims trends and adjust accordingly. but we think it's a very -- overall good block of business and as we continue to monitor, we should be able to -- to adjust any trends over time.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
john. maybe i'll just add a comment, i think it's fair to say that some of the benefits is potentially a reflection of the deferral of care in our medical line, although it is net of covid related medical and cost and group life costs, but overall we feel the majority of the performance is really that reflection of the actions we took in the last couple of years and more durable.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from ryan krueger of kbw. please go ahead.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning. i just was hoping for a little more detail on the u.s. covid claims in the quarter, particularly, can you give us any sense of like the average age of the claimants in the quarter and is that relative to prior quarters and is that the main driver of the lower average claim size, is the decline in average [technical issues].
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, sorry, i don't have that at my fingertips, maybe something we can follow up with. but, but yes, i think the number, how it's translated through to a lower average claim size is really the driver. so we're seeing in the current quarter, our covid cause of death claims are about 35% or so lower in size than what we've seen in the past. so we don't know whether that's the start of -- or is a change that will persist or if it's just something that is some volatility in the quarter, but that's something that we'll obviously continue to -- to monitor as we think about our rules of thumb going forward.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
thanks, second question was in the past you've shied away, i think from coinsuring universal life with secondary guarantees. are you -- would you be interested in block transaction there at this point, are you still more cautious on that line.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
we, i would say that we constantly are looking at opportunities and the example i'll offer up is ltc we watch that market, we didn't participate because we just felt that the risk-reward profile at that time just didn't fit, but over time that moved and we entered the market and i think we've done a very good job and that business has been very valuable for us, that's how i think about questions like the one you've just posed. it's a constant reevaluation because conditions change. and if we see conditions in the market that we feel are appropriate and that's the right levels for us, we will engage.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
thanks, and quick last one, do you have an updated view of the asia pacific run rate earnings you'd expect if we -- if we exclude covid impact.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
excluding covid on the traditional side, i think that $40 million to $45 million pre-tax quarterly rates good. and then on the, so the financial solutions side, which is doing quite well 15, maybe 15 million to 20 million as we go forward, but we'll see how the activity goes.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
all right, great, thanks a lot.
operator
we'll take our next question from tom gallagher of evercore. please go ahead.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
good morning. just a question on u.s. traditional, can you comment on how individual mortality compared to the your group business has been performing -- group life business has been performing. have you seen a noticeable change in trend between those two. what we've seen from some others is, it seems like almost all of the claims are coming through on the group side now, and it's not nearly as much of a covid impact for individual and just curious if you're seeing the same thing and then relatedly, can you provide some clarity on the mix of individual in-force versus group in force.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, hi, this is jonathan. i can just give you some historical context, what we've seen on the group and individual side. so for us by far the larger component that we've seen inception to-date through the pandemic is on the individual business. so over 90% of our u.s. mortality claims are in the individual line and less than 10% would be in the group space that relationship hasn't really changed materially over the course of the pandemic so far.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
got it. have you, but on an underlying basis, if you look at 2q results was there a noticeable change in trend for covid claims that were group versus individual or is your answer, should we just take the answer at face value and say, you haven't really seen a change in trend between the two.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, that's right. if i look at the split for q2 on its own, it's still that 90-10 is approximately the same.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
okay. and the -- just in terms of the covid hotspots internationally, it sounds like you're feeling better overall about how you see that developing. are there any areas, we see latin america seems to be still running on the high side, some emerging growth countries in asia also seem to be a bit elevated. can you just talk a little bit about, are there any other regions that are kind of on your watch list outside of india and south africa, which both sound like they're getting better.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, yeah, i am happy to and first off, i'll say that all of our regions are always on our watch list, but at this time, we don't have any significant concerns outside of the 5 markets that we've talked about u.s., u.k., canada, india and south africa. so if i look at latin america, as an example about 90% of our business there is annually renewable and a large component of it is health-related. we've been averaging less than $5 million a quarter over the last 5 quarters of covid costs. and then just looking at southeast asia, so on particular malaysian indonesia as an example where we're seeing higher general population deaths, indonesia our mortality exposure is very small as a lot of our business there is morbidity-related. malaysia is about 1% or so of our global mortality exposure. it's a relatively young book of business, so only 1% of our businesses over the age of 65 in malaysia and vaccination rates are climbing steadily there which is a good sign as well, so they are now about 45% with one dose and 23% fully vaccinated in malaysia, which should help dampen future impacts as well.
tom gallagher -- evercore -- analyst
okay, thanks.
operator
we'll take our next question from mike ward of ubs, please go ahead.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i just had a question on vaccinations overall. i was wondering if you have any data on the new mortalities, covid mortality is still coming in and whether or not they had been vaccinated. on the other side of that, the remaining population that isn't vaccinated or doesn't want to get vaccinated, at least in the u.s. i think that demographic is may be less likely to have life insurance in the first place. just trying to think about the geography of your remaining covid mortality exposure relative to the parts of the country that are more or less vaccinated.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, yeah, i know, happy to give a few thoughts there. so we don't have vaccination status on depth that we get, [phonetic] not enough information we have, we can look at external sources of data, again that the cdc study that i mentioned before, it's pretty clearly showing that there is a very high level of efficacy and very low level of death or mortality for people who have been vaccinated. so i think the numbers are something like 163 million people have been vaccinated and to date, there's only been 6600 people that have been in the hospital or have died who been fully vaccinated. so that just gives you a sense of the magnitude of the difference in the numbers there for sure. i am sorry i just -- i temporarily forgot the second part of your question, could you just repeat it.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, no, i guess just geographically in the u.s., it seems like there is lower vaccination rates in the south of the southeast and wondering about your yeah.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah. so from a geographic perspective, there's not that much difference sort of in our book versus the us population but we do think socioeconomically, there will be a benefit from when you mentioned that our insured people more likely to be vaccinated, there are studies that we've seen some other direct study that looks at insured vaccination levels but things that correlate vaccination rates to education level which is correlated to socioeconomic and also the likelihood to have insurance do demonstrate that you know that it is more likely that we believe that people who have insurance will be more vaccinated. and again that's partly impacting our reduction in our rule of thumb that we're seeing as well.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks. and then i was just wondering about how this pandemic might change your capital model going forward or your pricing targets for new business. are you pricing new business under the assumption or recognizing the potential for another more frequent pandemics going forward or is it just too early to tell on that.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, yeah, i think the long-term effects it's still a little too early to tell. we're definitely devoting a lot of resources to looking at, multiple categories of things that we believe could affect our future mortality, absolutely in the short term though, so the current covid impacts we were pricing those into all the business that we're actively writing so those are being reflected correctly.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
thanks very much.

operator
good day and welcome to the reinsurance group of america third quarter 2021 results conference call. today's conference call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to introduce mr. todd larson, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and ms. anna manning, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead, mr. larson.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. good morning and welcome to rga's third quarter 2021 conference call. with me this morning on the call is anna manning, rga's president and chief executive officer; leslie barbi, chief investment officer; jonathan porter, chief risk officer; and jeff hopson, head of investor relations. we will discuss the third quarter results after a quick reminder about forward-looking information and non-gaap financial measures. following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from expected results. please refer to the earnings release we issued yesterday for a list of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. additionally, during the course of this call, information we provide may include non-gaap financial measures. please see our earnings release, earnings presentation, quarterly financial supplement and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to gaap measures. and now i'll turn the call over to anna for her comments.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. last night we reported a loss of $1.11 in adjusted operating eps which included pre-tax $500 million in covid 19 impacts, or $5.59 per share. our 12 month trailing roe was 2.1%, which included 9.8% in covid 19 impacts. premium growth was strong at 9.5% and we ended the quarter with excess capital of $1 billion. this quarter saw elevated covid 19 claims in the us, india and south africa, consistent with the levels of general population mortality. in the us individual mortality business, covid 19 claims were $235 million in the quarter, slightly above the high end of our rules of thumb range. we also had a level of excess non covid 19 claims reflecting the elevated levels of excess mortality reported in the general population by the cdc. covid 19 claims in india and south africa were $161 million and $64 million respectively as those countries also experienced a material delta wave, and jonathan will provide further insights on our claims shortly. the performance this quarter ex covid 19 was strong and featured many highlights again demonstrating the value of our diversified global business and the strength of our new business franchise. the highlights this quarter include strong earnings across all lines and regions from our gfs business, deployment of $140 million of capital into in-force transactions, including our largest to date longevity transaction in the netherlands. this brings the year-to-date capital deployment into in-force transactions to a total of $440 million putting us on track for a very strong year as our pipelines remain very good with opportunities in all regions. i am particularly pleased with the recent success in our gfs business in asia. that business has grown from a relatively small base a few years ago, the one that has produced $66 million of adjusted operating income through the first nine months of this year. our success is in large part the result of our high-caliber local teams working together with our global product and risk experts to bring new solutions that best fit the needs of the local markets and clients. we are actively managing our capital position, balancing deployments into organic business and attractive in-force block opportunities with shareholder dividends, and in this quarter the resumption of share buybacks. and we generated additional capital with the completion of a financially attractive asset intensive retrocession transaction, i believe clear evidence of an efficient and effective capital management approach. investment results were favorable in the quarter despite the continued challenges of below market yields, impairments were minimal, and we realized some nice gains in our limited partnerships in real estate joint ventures. both our us group and us individual health business performed above our expectations, continuing a recent trend. as i think about this quarter and the last six quarters on the pandemic, i remain encouraged by the resilience of our global business and by the positive momentum in our new business opportunities and growth prospects. looking forward, we expect some continuing impact from covid 19 claims but believe these will be manageable endpoint to increasing vaccination rates globally as a reason for optimism. we operate from a position of strength with an outstanding workforce, valued client relationships, and healthy business fundamentals. we have a strong balance sheet and a track record of successful execution against our strategy. all this gives me confidence in our business and in our opportunities for growth. even though a lot of the focus this quarter is on covid 19 claims, we are accomplishing a lot in terms of adding substantial new long-term value. i'm proud of this team and all that we've achieved and i am excited about the future, and look forward to sharing more thoughts at our investor day on december 9. thank you for your interest in rga. i hope you all remain safe and stay well, and let me now turn it over to todd to go over the detailed financial results.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks. anna. rga reported a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $89 million for the quarter and adjusted operating eps loss of $1.11 per share which includes a negative covid 19 impact of $5.59 per share. our trailing 12 months adjusted roe was 2.1% which is net of covid impacts of 9.8%. while we did experience a significant level of covid 19 impacts, our underlying non-covid 19 results were strong as demonstrated by the year-to-date growth in our book value per share excluding aoci of 4% to $137.60. i would highlight this growth in book value per share is after absorbing approximately $1 billion pre-tax of covid 19 claim costs. consolidated reported premiums increased 9.5% in the quarter, or 7.7% on a constant currency basis. reported premiums did reflect a couple of one-off items where organic growth was very good and new business activity is encouraging across all regions. the effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.2% on pre-tax adjusted operating loss below our expected range of 23% to 24% primarily due to adjusted operating income and higher tax jurisdictions and losses in tax jurisdictions, for which we did not receive a tax benefit. this was partially offset by favorable adjustments from tax returns filed in the quarter.
turning to the segment results as listed on slide 6 of the earnings presentation, the us and latin america traditional segment included approximately $250 million of covid 19 claim cost, approximately $235 million of which was in our us individual mortality business and the balance in our us group business. we saw non covid 19 excess claims of approximately $75 million, which is consistent with higher non-covid 19 population mortality as per cdc reporting. the us group and individual health business both performed better than our expectations due to favorable experience overall, even after reflecting $15 million of covid 19 claims in our us group lines of business. variable investment income was strong in the quarter as both limited partnership performance and real estate joint venture realizations were favorable. the us asset intensive business reported very strong results. the segment had favorable overall experience and higher variable investment income. we continue to be pleased with the results in this segment. the canada traditional segment results reflected favorable experience in the group and creditor lines of business, slightly offset by covid 19 claim costs in individual life -- line of approximately $5 million. the canada financial solutions segment results reflected modestly unfavorable experience. in the europe, middle east and africa segment, the traditional business results reflected covid 19 claim cost of $80 million in total, of which $64 million was in south africa, and $13 million in the u.k. we also saw some excess mortality claims believed to be directly or indirectly covid 19 related. emea's financial solutions had a good quarter as business results reflected favorable longevity experience, $4 million attributable to covid 19. turning to our asia pacific traditional business, asia results reflect covid 19 claim cost of $169 million of which $161 million was in india. this impact was higher than our expectation and jonathan will provide further information in a few minutes. australia reported a small loss for the quarter. we continue to take necessary actions to manage the business back to consistent profitability. the asia financial solutions business had a good quarter reflecting favorable experience and strong growth in new business. as anna mentioned, we continue to be pleased with the growth and contributions from this segment. the corporate and other segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $27 million, which is in line with our quarterly average run rate.
moving on to investments, the non-spread portfolio yield for the quarter was 4.95%, reflecting both our well-diversified portfolio allocation and strong variable investment income primarily due to realizations from limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures. while hard to predict from a timing perspective, variable investment income is a core part of our investment earnings. the investment portfolio average rating was unchanged in the quarter and investment credit impairments were again nominal. our new money rate increased to 3.7% with the majority of purchases in public investment grade assets and contributions from strong private asset production. regarding capital management, our excess capital position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1 billion. our capital position remains strong and we have ample liquidity. we deployed $140 million into in-force transactions and repurchased $46 million of shares. additionally, we entered into an asset intensive retrocession transaction that generated $94 million of capital and enhanced our returns. this quarter highlights our balanced approach to capital management and our ability to absorb the impacts of covid 19, fund organic growth, deploy capital into transactions, and return capital through share repurchases and dividends. i will now turn the call over to jonathan porter, our chief risk officer, who will provide additional comments on our covid 19 related experience.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
thanks, todd. i'm going to review our q3 claims experience and then provide some views on our covid claim cost expectations for q4. the global emergence of the delta variant has been a key driver of higher general population mortality in the quarter. we were optimistic in our last earnings call that trends in the us would lead to an improvement in mortality over the remainder of the year. however, q3 saw increases in both covid 19 and non-covid 19 general population mortality. as you will see on slide 12 of our earnings presentation, the us population graphs show the level of covid 19 reported deaths and the number of non-covid 19 excess deaths over the course of the pandemic. there are three key takeaways. covid 19 reported deaths increased substantially in the quarter. covid 19 deaths under the age of 65, ages where there is more life insurance exposure were at their highest points over the past six quarters. non-covid 19 excess deaths were at their highest relative and absolute level since the start of the pandemic. our individual mortality claims results --sorry, us individual mortality claims results are consistent with what was happening in the general population. covid 19 claim costs were $235 million in the quarter, slightly above the higher end of our rule of thumb. q3 results reflect higher mortality in ages under 65 and larger average claim sizes. on a year-to-date basis, covid 19 claims are at the midpoint of our range. our excess non-covid 19 experience was also driven by higher claims frequency consistent with the elevated deaths in the general population. turning to markets other than us individual mortality covid 19 claim costs of $161 million in india were higher than our prior estimates, reflecting the more adverse impact of the q2 delta wave. similar to what we are observing in the us, the delta verint has resulted in higher general population deaths, a shift of deaths to younger more insured ages and a larger average claim size. $30 million of this impact in the quarter relates to an increase in ibnr, resulting in a covid specific ibnr balance for india of $75 million at the end of the quarter. covid 19 claim costs in south africa are estimated at $64 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the distribution of general population deaths by province, as well as some large claims volatility. q3 general population data indicates that provinces with higher socioeconomic levels and therefore more insurance penetration and larger sized policies were more adversely impacted this quarter. other markets including canada and the u.k. accounted for $30 million of estimated covid 19 claim costs. as expected, our longevity offset was modest in the quarter given relatively low levels of general population deaths in the u.k. where our longevity business is concentrated. looking ahead to q4, elevated levels of excess general population mortality are continuing in the us through october, although currently running at lower levels and experienced at their peak in september and trending downward. we are maintaining our claim cost rule of thumb of $10 million to $20 million for every 10,000 general population deaths. we are also maintaining our rule of thumb for the u.k. and canada at this time. general population covid 19 deaths in india and south africa have been relatively modest through october. predicting covid 19 claim costs continues to be challenging in particular in india where comprehensive data is not available about. although india and south africa vaccination levels are still below our other key markets, they have increased materially in both countries since the beginning of q3, which will reduce the scenario of future covid 19 impacts. we remain confident that the impacts will be manageable. let me now hand it back to todd.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. before opening it up for questions, i would like to remind you of our upcoming investor day scheduled for december 9. we hope you can join us for our discussion. we now like to open it up for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] in the interest of time, please keep to one question with one follow-up. we will take our first question from humphrey lee of dowling partners. please go ahead, your line is open.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. i guess my first question is about the non-covid 19 excess mortality in the us. can you provide some color in terms of maybe the age cohorts on average claim size or maybe the cost of that based on your analysis.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, humphrey, it's jonathan. i'll take that. so our yields mortality experience this quarter is really driven by broad based higher frequency of claims and that's due to covid and non-covid, so the whole piece. there is no notable patterns by issue your cohorts or policy size or clients. consistent with general population data, we are seeing an overall increase in excess mortality at ages less than 65, which is really a change that we've highlighted from earlier in the pandemic. for the average claim size added at the -- sorry, aggregate level across us mortality is actually relatively stable quarter-to-quarter. but as i mentioned earlier, the covid specific claim size has increased.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
got it. my second question is more about india and south africa. how much did you normally earn in india and south africa before the pandemic? just kind of looking at data claims so far by my count, the covid claims from these two countries have been roughly 400 million since the pandemic, pretty much kind of one-third of the claims that you've seen in the us. and looking at the mortality amount of risk disclosure that you provided in the first quarter '20 dac, they can be more than low single digit percentage points. so can you just help us to kind of get a better perspective of be exposure for this country and how the size of those claims could be relatively large compared to the -- your exposure there?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, see i'll talk about the exposure from a net amount of risk perspective, humphrey. so india represents about 5% of our global net amount of risk. south africa is between 1% and 2% of our net amount of risk just to give you a sense of the scale. as you mentioned the covid claims experience has been material in both of those markets, i guess you could say disproportionate to the actual net amount of risk exposure we have, that's really a function of the underlying general population mortality experience that we're seeing. we also routinely obviously discuss with clients what's happening in those markets, and what we're seeing in south africa as an example is consistent with what our clients are seeing. so again it's the impacts we're seeing from covid is really a reflection of what's happening in the general population.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
okay, all right, thanks.
operator
we will move on to our next question from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please go ahead, your line is open.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning. maybe to start off on capital management, you indicate a $1 billion of excess capital. given the sharp losses this quarter, maybe a little color on your outlook for share repurchases and any other uses of capital, but could you keep to buyback going?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, andrew. it's todd.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
apologies, todd. maybe i can start and then ask you to add. andrew, we're on a long-term business and supporting clients whether on their organic needs are block deals, that's really core to our strategy. so when we think about capital management, we start there. we start by looking at new business opportunities in the pipelines and how we feel about those opportunities and then the likelihood of winning and what are the return levels we think we can get. and remember, some of our deals do take time to complete. we then weigh that against all the alternatives, returning capital through buybacks, through dividends, really looking for the best and most valuable use of our excess capital. that's how we'll approach capital management in the past, it's produced a nice balance. we expect to go back there. and in my mind this quarter doesn't change that. todd, would you like to add?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think that covers the thing, anna.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
okay.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
and just i actually have one more major question i think. this is in a side related to that. $94 million of asset intensive retrocession, so you you raised $94 million of capital, maybe a little color on why that was done?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. andrew, it's todd. so this is a transaction that we [indecipherable] the inbound transaction we've entered into fairly recently and we like the overall characteristics of the block that we were able to find financially attractive retrocession terms that actually help enhance our returns overall on the block, which we thought was very attractive. and when we retrocede part of that asset intensive block it freed up some of the capital that we had against the block.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then just with regard to premium, i mean, us looked really good. you mentioned a onetime restructuring of an existing tree -- i wasn't sure what the normalized number would be in the us ex that restructure and what did it relate to? and with that, why were the premium so strong? that's terrific. i mean, canada, emea, they all looked great in terms of growth, but us in particular why strong?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so the first part of your question, yes, we had a transaction that had been in place for a little bit of time in the us and latin america segment. that converted from what we call sort of low-risk or deposit accounting to where we took more of the biometrics risk and under gaap accounting it turned in -- translated into risk accounting where you recognize the premiums and benefits and that type of thing on the income statement. so that added to the premium growth in the us and latin america segment. if you back that out, i think the growth in the us is probably between 4% and 5%.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. so more normalized.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, yes.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
and in canada? in canada and the eu [indecipherable] really strong, anything driving that?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, no -- so canada did some transactions and saw good business growth. and then really for emea, it was across the region, which was good to see just a lot of good activity.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks a lot.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i would add, andrew. yeah. andrew, i would add that reflecting what i believe to be, or reflecting our approach during the pandemic which was we stayed close to our clients. we provided a lot of thought leadership throughout the pandemic, underwriting expertise, and i think part of that is translating into business activities that we're seeing.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks so much.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
and today [phonetic] maybe add-ons details point is in for canada emea, there was some positive fx contribution to the reported premium growth.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
alright. saw that in the release. thanks.
operator
we will move on to our next question from erik bass of autonomous research. please go ahead, your line is open.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi, thank you. and for the us traditional block, can you give some more color on the age and product breakdown of your mortality book and where the covid impacts occurred this quarter? i guess i'm trying to get a sense of why your sensitivity this quarter looks different from what we've seen from a lot of the primary companies and even the other reinsurers and where they are seeing less covid losses in individual life as the percentage of population deaths if mortality moves to younger ages.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, this is jonathan, erik. so, yes, so we have the largest proportion of our business would be in sort of that middle age range. so what i mean is sort of that 40 to 65 range. so that is a larger proportion of our business relative to the older ages where we're seeing the early impacts from the pandemic. so i think that shift down below 65 is part of the impact there. also, we tend to have larger policy sizes as well when you move down those age ranges, which i think is partly what's driving some of the increase in size.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
okay.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
[indecipherable] term block where you may have sort of higher face values or where you're taking kind of excess amounts above -- so the primary companies are seating kind of excess risk to you.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
hi, eirk, i don't think that's necessarily the case. i think the thing to remember when you're comparing our sensitivities or our rules of thumbs against others is that the size of the block matters because we're all using per 10,000 deaths in the population. so you would expect that if you're comparing a sensitivity from one firm to another, if there is double and triple the size of the block of business we would expect to see that in the resulting sensitivities.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. no, i was looking at relative to -- in ranges where others were coming in sort of at the lower end of the ranges versus yours slightly above the high end. so not the absolute number, but the relative.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
[technical issues] just one more thing to keep in mind too is that we do think there is potentially some quarterly volatility here as well. so it's hard to draw conclusions from based on one quarter's information, just kind of an immediate -- something that's occurred recently in q2 we actually saw quite a low level relative to our range. so they can move around quarter-to-quarter. so that's why we want to see some more data emerge before you consider making a change to our range.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. thank you. and if i could just ask one follow-up on the india business. how much of a reporting lag are you seeing in that business? it looked like the population deaths were actually lower in 3q than 2q. so it was a lot of this kind of a catch up on kind of deaths that actually occurred in earlier periods?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah. yeah, no, it's exactly right. so of the $161 million charge that we took this quarter, the majority of it, so around $138 million or so relates to q2 experience. so due to these longer reporting lags we did establish an expectation in ibnr last quarter, but really that was done pre delta wave. all right. so we were going on information that we had based on what we had experienced in india, as you recall, is really the first country to have a material delta wave impact. so that's really what's causing the difference now. so we're seeing the delta wave move into younger ages, higher policy size amounts. so most of what we're seeing this quarter relates to last quarter.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. thank you.

we'll move on to our next question from john barnidge of piper sandler. please go ahead, your line is open.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much, and good morning. the chief operating officer left, was there a charge in the quarter or is that going to occur in 4q?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
there is. hi, john, it's todd. there was nothing in in 3q and i -- as of right now, i'm not expecting anything material in the fourth quarter.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then my follow-up question, maybe asking the buyback question a little bit differently. can you talk about how the cadence of those buybacks changed as the quarter went along in the delta variant emerged? thanks for the answer.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
no we -- on the buybacks, we wanted to -- so our confidence in the business and the value proposition of our enterprise, so we decided to go ahead and take repurchased some shares. and i'm trying to think back of the exact timing, but it wasn't a huge consideration related to the covid impact, but was before this significant, i guess, impact that we saw -- do about how significant the impact was.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we will move on to our next question from ryan krueger of kbw. please go ahead, your line is open.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi, good morning. back to the us covid impacts. could you help us understand a little -- in a little bit more detail how material the impact was from the higher average claim size versus just the higher incidents?
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yes. so just to give you a number, so this quarter our average covid claim was about 22% higher than what it has been for the first two quarters of the year or the -- through the prior waves.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
that's helpful. and i mean i guess at this point, is there any reason to think that wouldn't continue given the shift in -- to the younger ages. and i guess what i'm getting at is the only reason you're not changing your sensitivity because you want to see more data and increased credibility but [indecipherable] through it there wouldn't be much reason to think higher severity issue would really change if the age mix continues as it did in the third quarter.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, i think it's too early to draw that conclusion for certain. it's possible we could continue to see higher average claim size and the shift to younger ages. as i mentioned earlier, it does vary a lot quarter to quarter. and the prior quarter, which also we're showing some increase in covid mortality into the younger ages, actually was our lowest average claims size quarter for covid that we've had over the course of the pandemic. so i think it is too early to to determine how much of this of will persist or not. and as we get more data over the course of this quarter, we'll evaluate that if we need to update our range.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. and then on block deals you've been pretty active this year for -- but can you also comment on langhorne and activity you might be seeing there at this point.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let me take that one. so first, let me start with your langhorne questions, then perhaps follow i can provide some color on our deals. we're remaining active at langhorne. it's one of our top priorities. we have dedicated resources that are actively at work on deals and i remain optimistic about getting one across the line, getting more than one across the line. on the q3 deals, very pleased with the quarter's deals as todd mentioned $140 million of capital. and if you add the $300 million in the first quarter, that brings us to $440 million for the three quarters. that puts us on track for a very strong year especially given the state of the pipelines. i was pleased with the distribution of the deals. we did life deal in asia, one in the u.k. and then an aig asset intensive deals in emea. and overall, i'm very happy with the deal and optimistic on the pipelines.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
thank you.

we'll move on to our next question from michael ward of ubs, please go ahead, your line is open.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
thanks guys, good morning. maybe to expand on the buyback cadence question, so you said the buyback decision todd was before you realized how kind of bad the covid impact would be. so i guess, does that mean we should think you'll be more conscious going forward. and have you bought back any shares in 4q to-date?
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, the way i would look at it is we have -- we continue to have a strong balance sheet and we feel we can be prudent and balanced around our overall capital management. certainly, we're going to keep an eye on what's unfolding with the the pandemic, but certainly as anna mentioned earlier, we'll look at deploying capital in the transactions where we like the liability profile and we can get attractive returns. and we'll continue to look at the dividend and share repurchases. we'll continue that sort of a balanced and prudent approach as we go forward.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then regarding the annuity retrocession deal, you said it was inbound. but can we think about this as maybe the first of more to come, or should we be thinking about rga as potentially in maybe the de-risking bucket and are there other areas in life for annuities or you could do more of this, free up capital and give us maybe a new reason to look at rga. thanks.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
you want to mention the inbound transaction that was -- it was the inbound transaction to rga and then we rent for a portion of that to a third party. i would not view it -- the retrocession that we did as de-risking. it was more we were able -- from an economic perspective, it was an attractive transaction for us to do and it enhanced our overall returns while providing some capital flexibility. and certainly it's something, as we've mentioned in the past, we are looking at our -- there is capital management tool kit items that we can have access to and retrocession at what we would view as favorable economic terms is certainly one of those things that we'll keep in mind over time.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
and i'd like to emphasize the motivation for that transaction was not to de-risk. it was a opportunistic transaction, very attractive financially and it happened to generate $100 million in capital.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we'll move onto our next question from tom gallagher of evercore asi -- isi. please go ahead, your line is open.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. i guess my first question is, has the emerging experience caused you to push through any rate or are you contemplating pushing through any rate whether that's in the us or some of these international markets where particularly india, south africa. i'm assuming the loss ratios might be 500%, 1000%, we don't know how much premium you're charging. because there's obviously a lot of uncertainty with where the pandemic is going to go, but you probably have some scenarios where the loss emergence here could really pressure the -- what the combined ratio would be in these businesses for the next year or two. so just curious, overall how are you thinking about that and are you planning on pushing through rate where you can in either us or some of these other markets.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start with --
operator
oh, sorry. please go ahead.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
i know it's difficult as these virtual calls is well how to remove, stay in room. go ahead. jonathan, i'll add to -- i'll add my comments at the end.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. yeah, thanks. yes. so i mean, i guess, i would just say, first, we are taking action and have been for quite some time to reflect our expectations for covid and the pricing of new business that we're writing. that's the first thing i would note. we're also being cautious in markets where we think there is more risk. so that relates to how we're evaluating new business, volumes in new business that we're choosing to accept types of business we're choosing to accept. and we're also applying a thoughtful approach on our underwriting as well. so again, just to manage the risk exposure. so while we do have open treaties and this is [technical issues] place globally, not just in any one market, we're working with our clients very closely. we're adjusting underwriting rules and taking new data into account as we assess the risks. anna?
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
todd, thank you, you've covered it.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
so -- and i appreciate that, and that's just on new business, so you're not repricing existing treaties for this emerging experience at all.
todd c. larson -- senior executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, certainly where we have the opportunity to do that, it's being considered. so for group business as an example, which is annually renewable generally speaking, that absolutely is being repriced and taken into account the covid expectations. for longer-term business i think you have to think of that business in more of a longer-term context as well and obviously you know we have an approach where we consider not just the current period but future periods and what our overall balance of our relationships with our clients and we take all of that into account when we consider actions on the long-term business.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
got you. and i guess the other -- the next question is sort of enterprise risk management too. do you -- now obviously this experience, i think most people are viewing this whole emerging experience like a catastrophe that's lasted a year and a half is essentially and not likely to recur hopefully much beyond the current timeframe. but does it cause you to rethink enterprise risk management at all? like, do you think now given this experience kind of the variant that have occurred, does that cause you to rethink how you're thinking about risk management overall, meaning, is there some permanent change in loss ratio you think that needs to be factored in. and maybe it's the -- maybe set in a better way, is the tail risk here now a lot higher than you would have previously thought that could sort of be sustained higher losses. and if so, how does that kind of inform your view on either exposure risk management or pricing. so kind of a high-level question, but just curious how you're looking at this whole experience.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, yeah. i know and i think a hallmark of a good risk management process and hopefully we can put ourselves in that bucket, is really looking at lessons learned, right? so after you go through an event like this we're analyzing what the impacts were and making adjustments in the future. so we're not -- that work is ongoing and really always always happening when we analyze and look at our business. so things like our process over the last two decades to diversify our book of business, i think has been part of that thinking around risk management. and i think we'll continue to be an element of what we think about right as far as our having a solid mix of risks across the enterprise, which has proven itself i think going to last six quarters, that's been very helpful position to be in. things like you mentioned about tail risk and capital models, those are elements that we're considering as well. i think our capital model even with these impacts we've had so far has proven out to be conservative in what our expectations were for a pandemic event. but i think you need to look at the data that's emerging, you need to consider what that means and obviously that will push then into pricing, to risk management [technical issues] and so i think it is a work in progress, but i think everything you mentioned are things we're thinking about as well.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
got you. and then just final question if i could on that same topic. any changes you're considering over the near term, whether that's limiting risk to some of these markets that have had very high loss ratios, india, south africa, etc., whether it's utilization of retrocession or cutting the size or any risk mitigants that you're thinking about over the near term, or are you still going to wait to evaluate more experience.
jonathan porter -- executive vice president, global chief risk officer
yeah, i know i. i mean, i think i'll point out again the -- what we've already done, right? so this is something that we in fact been taking active positions on since the start of the pandemic really and it goes into what you were saying about managing volumes, managing type of business that we're accepting, changing prices. so all of those things have been things we've been active to do over the course of the pandemic and we'll continue to do.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
we'll move on to our next question from james inglis. please go ahead, your line is open.
james inglis -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'm talking -- i'm thinking about your ability to generate capital through the retrocessional transaction, and presumably that is because there is a capital provider who is willing to take a lower return than you folks would, which is good. but i'm just trying to draw contrast if there is, are there any parallels to be made with the ability or the availability of capital in the world, if you will, as opposed to your ability to get deals done in langhorne, i mean, it seems to me there's got to be some parallel there and correct me if i'm wrong.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
could you reframe your question because i'm not sure i'm connecting the retrocession transaction which again was not motivated by capital to your question about capital.
james inglis -- analyst
no, you're correct, in which -- and i wasn't making analogy that it was motivated by capital but it was -- i was trying to make an analogy it was motivated by other capital providers interest in getting return on that and that book of business and how that must be limiting the fact that there is that capital available out there must be limiting your ability to do deals in langhorne.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
oh, now i see the connection that you're drawing. yes, there is a lot of competition out there. and there are a lot of capital providers who are interested in the type of transactions that -- well, the transaction in particular that we did, the retrocession transactions. look, i think price is a factor in doing deals, but it's not the only factor. we don't just compete on price. we compete on a broader value proposition, and that's around expertise. our risk expertise and our structuring expertise and in particular our appetite to take insurance, life insurance biometrics risk as opposed to the asset type of deals, which i think is generally where those new capital providers are focused. so yes, price is a factor, but it's not the only factor. i remain optimistic about getting deals done in langhorne.
james inglis -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. good luck.
operator
we'll take our next question from michael ward ubs, please go ahead, your line is open.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for the follow-up. my question already from langhorne, my question around the retrocession i wasn't implying that delisting is a negative thing, i think if anything it's a positive. you know, we've been seeing life companies do this especially over the last year or two. and even just talking about having a plan to monetize certain assets or blocks that are maybe more capital intensive and whatnot. it's been a clear positive for those companies or at least our stock. so, my question was more along the lines of, do you want to do more of this? i know this was a sort of opportunistic deals, but i'm wondering if this is something that you want to do more of. thanks.
anna manning -- president and chief executive officer
right. thank you for that -- thank you for that follow-up question. we're open to consider -- to considering a future transactions where it makes sense for us. and as we've already mentioned, this was a nice transaction and it fit in many respects. it isn't something that's new for us, we've done retrocessions and securitizations in the past, and i expect we'll continue to do them as market conditions, as opportunities arise, as the economics makes sense for us. it's another tool in our toolkit.
michael ward -- ubs -- analyst
