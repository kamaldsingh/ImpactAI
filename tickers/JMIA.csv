sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, safae. thank you very much. welcome, everyone. thanks for joining the call.
i hope that you are all staying safe and well. the focus of our strategy has been very clear and remains unchanged, build a sustainable platform to capture this great opportunity of e-commerce in africa. and what we mean by sustainable is to bring indisputable facts and evidence that our business model positions us well to become profitable. and as you can see in our results, here are the facts for the quarter.
number one, we have reduced our adjusted ebitda loss by 47%. we are now for five quarters in a row profitable after fulfillment at group level. the majority of our country is now breakeven before g&a. we are growing the usage of jumia in the categories which we have chosen to focus on, and we do all of the above with lower g&a expenses and lower sales and advertising expenses.
so, overall, we feel very strong about those results, which clearly bring more evidence of the strength of our business model. if we look into a few more details on page 4, on the usage of jumia, of course, 2020 was marked by the business mix rebalancing toward the highest share of everyday product categories and by a strong focus on efficiency, ensuring that the usage would drive attractive unit economics. we drove down the share of phones and electronics from 66% to 43% of gmv. we achieved the 5-point improvements in cancellations, failed deliveries, and returns, which went from 30% to 25%, meaning that the usage we drive is more efficient and can be better monetized.
gmv and orders, post-cfdr, has been growing by 16% and 19% on all the business outside phones and electronics, which is the business we have deliberately chosen to reduce. on usage for us, it was a year of choice of going selectively and efficiently. jumiapay. tpv increased by 68% and the penetration has now reached 35% of orders at group level.
we added more than 100 new digital services on the jumiapay app in order to bring more relevance and convenience to our consumers. on revenues, marketplace revenue and gross profit increased by 20% and 22%, respectively, and our gross profit margin as a percentage of gmv increased by almost 4 points now reaching 12%. and last but not least, we generated significant savings across all cost lines, and we now have a leaner, more efficient cost structure. fulfillment expense went down by 10%.
sales and advertising went down by 42%. and g&a, outside share-based compensation, went down by 12%. so if you look at our p&l, we're going to profitable usage. we're increasing the gross profit after fulfillment while decreasing g&a and sales and advertising.
so mathematically, we'll reach breakeven if we continue to do that. on page 5, in 2019, we set ourselves a clear objective, reduce our loss in absolute terms. and i think it's clear, very clear that we are delivering strongly against that objective. we reduced the adjustability loss by 10% in q1, 26%, into q2, 50% into q3, and 47% in q4.
and this progress, importantly, was achieved as a result of driving both more profitable usage and lower costs. on page 6, you can see how we have transformed our p&l over the last few years. in 2019, we were still not making money after logistics. and overall, for every order which was placed on the platform, we were still making a loss.
and you can see also our costs were going up. now, you can see how gross profit after fulfillment is continuously increasing, having rebalanced the category mix and leveraging linear cost base, each order we now generate takes us closer to profitability. and at the same time, the cost structure is clearly becoming more efficient across the board. so once again, a clear evidence about the path to profitability at the p&l level.
on page 7, if we zoom on the unit economics for the quarter, our average order value is now eur 29. that's 19% smaller than last year. and every single component of our unit economics has improved. gross profit per order plus 15%, gross profit over gmv plus almost 4 points.
gross profit after fulfillment, now, eur 1 when it was eur 0.1 last year, sales and advertising minus 33% per order; taking g&a, minus 28% per order. so a lot of progress made, both on the revenues and on the costs. and this progress, as we have been talking about, has been achieved without tailwind from covid. we discussed already last time.
and we discussed that covid did not lead to any drastic changes in consumer behavior on our platform nor meaningful surge of volume at pan-african level. rather, it had net negative effect on the business due to localized supply and logistic disruptions that we have been experiencing throughout the year. obviously, the situation is still evolving. we continue to monitor, in particular, the rising cases, the rollout of the vaccine and at what speed that will happen, and the overall negative impact on consumer sentiment and spending power.what's important is that all the actions that we took last year, in 2019 and 2020, whether it's the increased focus on everyday categories, or the cost efficiencies that we generated, and also the proactive capital raised that we conducted in december, all those actions, they enhance our resilience to volatility, macro-volatility, and they position us very well for the long term.
and i'll conclude by sharing with you on page 9 a few of the many initiatives we undertook this year. our key priority has been helping our people, consumers, sellers, and communities we serve to stay safe, of course, and as much as possible, functioning through the crisis. over the initiatives, we illustrate how important it is for us to drive impact beyond our day-to-day operations. and obviously happy to give you more color in our discussions on all this.
our mission and our values drive our actions. and we are immensely grateful to our teams, our frontliners, in particular, who have truly embodied these values and acted with an incredible sense of purpose, resourcefulness, and dedication. we thank you all very, very much for that. and with this, i'll hand over to jeremy.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you. hello, everyone. our focus in q4 2020 and, in fact, throughout the whole year was to drive the usage with, one, high level of marketing efficiency; and two, in a disciplined and selective manner, favoring the categories that supported the consumer lifetime value and profitability. on slide 11, on the first point, you can see that in q4, 2020, we continued driving usage with very strong marketing efficiency.
having built over the past nine years, one of the strongest brands in africa, we are now able to be much more tactical and much more efficient in our sales and advertising spend. as we reduced our sales and advertising spend by 34% year over year, the gmv was down 21% year over year, reaching eur 231 million in q4. sales and advertising expense per order decreased by 33%, while orders declined by 3%. on the other hand, while the annual sales and advertising expense per annual active consumer decreased by 48% year over year, our annual active consumers were up 12% with both new and returning consumers.
it's worth noting that the gmv and the orders accelerated by 23% and 21%, respectively, in q4 2020 compared to q3 2020, supported by the black friday event that we did in november 2020. and despite a significant reduction in marketing spend, in the 2020 edition of the events, we still registered record level of consumer engagement. page views across all platforms reached 1.5 billion during the event. that's 33% compared to last year.
and our black friday video content registered almost 100 million views, which is 3 times higher compared to the 2019 events. and this speaks to the relevance of our platform and the content for consumers. one aspect that we monitor very closely when it comes to the usage growth is cancellations, failed delivery and return ratio, and the trend of our usage indicators, post-cfdr. if you go on page 12 and you look at the full-year 2020 trends, you'll see meaningful improvement in this ratio, both as a percentage of the gmv and the order.
the gmv ratio improved from 30% in 2019 to 25% in 2020, while the order ratio improved from 22% to 16%. this improvement means that our usage is becoming more efficient because a higher proportion of the gross receipts can be monetized and our marketing investment even more efficient on a net basis. and in fact, we have been growing the profitable usage. gmp and orders post-cfdr, has been growing by 15% and 19% on all the business outside phone and electronic, which is the business we have deliberately chosen to reduce in the context of the business mix rebalancing that we undertook.
if we look at page 13 and the impact of the business mix rebalancing. one, we reduced our reliance on phones and electronics, which went from contributing 56% of our gmv last year to 43% this year. two, in parallel, our average order value decreased by 23% from eur 39 to eur 30, as did everyday categories such as beauty, fmcg, fashion, which are gaining prominence on our platform and gmv are typically lower ticket sites. and three, while smaller in average value, our orders are also more profitable, as gross profit after fulfillment expense per order went from a loss of eur 0.10 in q4 2019 to a profit of eur 0.80 in q4 2020.
so in conclusion, on usage, we grew where we wanted to and very efficiently. we have a better mix of categories today than a year ago, and much better unit economics. let's now look at jumiapay on page 15. the tpv increased by 30% from eur 46 million in q4 last year to eur 59 million in q4 this year, taking on platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of the gmv from 15.6% to 25.7% in q4 this year.
on page 16, jumiapay transactions increased by 10% from eur 2.4 million last year to eur 2.7 million this year, with transactions above eur 10, which include prepaid purchases on the jumia physical good marketplace, and jumia platforms growing by 55% over the same period. overall, 33.1% of the orders placed on the jumia platform in q4 2020 were paid for using jumiapay, compared to 29.5% last year. so jumiapay will be the checkout solution that provides our consumer and sellers with a fast payment experience. at checkout, consumers can create a jumiapay account by linking it to the underlying payment method of their choice.
jumiapay stays order to the relevant payment methods in africa and encompasses more than 15 different underlying payment methods. it's also underpinned by our tech stack that's recording 99.9% of time in 2020, including during the major promotional events such as black friday where the uptime was 100%. the other aspect of jumiapay that i'd like to spend a bit more time on is a jumiapay app, which is a great way for us to provide consumers with more payments use case that are relevant to them and tried the user engagement and stickiness for them. and now, on the page 17, we're building jumiapay app with a view to making it a destination for broad range of lifestyle and financial services, all offered on a prepaid basis and powered by jumiapay.
at the end of 2020, jumiapay app had approximately 200 services live on the app, offered by 33 partners across five countries in africa. since inception in 2018, the app registered over 4 million downloads and is highly rated by consumers. we are focused on building a diversified category mix on the app, with 43% of 2020 gmv coming from airtime, 40% from [inaudible], and internet payments. we are also developing new categories where we see meaningful growth potential, such as financial services, which already accounted for 10% of the jumiapay app gmv, gaming, which accounted for 4%, lifestyle services 3% and transportation and travel categories, which are still nascent at this stage.
the development of jumiapay, whether as the checkout solution, and the broader business platform, or the consumer-facing super app, is a key priority for us. and while we have accomplished a lot in the mvp of jumiapay four years ago, we have barely scratched the surface of the payment and fintech opportunity in africa. and we believe that we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. let's move now on monetization, page 19.
in the context of the 21% year-over-year gmv contraction in q4, marketplace revenue increased by 7% and gross profit by 12% over the same period.taking a closer look at our work-use marketplace revenue streams on slide 20. the commissions increased by 19% year over year due to an increase in the share of higher commission rate categories, including fashion, beauty, or fmcg, as well as lower promotional intensity. fulfillment revenues increased by 14%, as a result of continued shipping fee adjustment, as well as pricing changes within our cross-border logistics. initially, these changes in q3 2020 and continue to roll them into fall.
as part of these changes, portion of the international shipping fees that were previously charged to the centers are now passed on to the consumers. this change resulted in some of our international logistic revenue to be recorded as fulfillment revenue instead of revenue from value-added services. this is also what drove the 27% decrease in value-added services. marketing and advertising revenue increased by 30%, as a result of the strong pickup by advertisers of jumia advertising solutions, particularly during the black friday, where we ran campaigns on behalf of over 150 different advertisers, including high-profile partners such as reckitt, l'oreal, huawei, png, intel, and many more.
we intend to further diversify our revenue mix by monetizing not only the transaction and the usage of our marketplace but also the broader assets of our platform. and we're starting to drive revenue from jumia logistics. let me tell you a bit more about it on page 29. logistics in africa are notoriously challenging with multiple hurdles, such as the lack of address, the lack of organized and reliable capacity, storage space issues, and so on.
so the pain point jumia logistics is addressing is very big, and one that is seen by many businesses and industry in africa. with that in mind, we conducted a pilot in 2020 to open up jumia logistics to third parties, whether sellers on the jumia marketplace or not, business clients can now leverage the jumia logistics platform for their fulfillment needs. as part of this pilot, we shipped almost half a million packages on behalf of more than 270 clients across five countries. we have outlined some examples for you on the page.
for example, in nigeria, we work with kuda bank, nigeria's first mobile-only bank, as one of their preferred logistics partner to deliver payment costs to consumers. in morocco, we work with meditel, local entity of orange, a leading global technical operator, to deliver sim cards and activations to consumers. in kenya, we work with premier food, global food, and packaged goods producers, to offer logistics solution from their main warehouse in nairobi to all their distribution centers across kenya. the results of the pilot are very promising, the traction we have with our first clients reinforce our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this revenue stream.
and now, i'll hand over to antoine.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeremy. hello, everyone. moving on to cost. i'm now on page 23.
we have been driving strong efficiencies across the full cost structure. fulfillment expense decreased by 18% in q4 2020, compared to q4 2019, as a result of operational enhancements across all logistics operations. these include the optimization of all cross-border shipping metrics, staff cost savings in our fulfillment centers, and a change in our daily repricing model from cost per package to cost per stop. in addition, we were able to pass on an increasing proportion of our fulfillment expense to the combination of consumers and sellers via our fulfillment and value-added services revenue streams, respectively.
the pass-through of all fulfillment expense measured at the ratio of fulfillment plus value=added services, revenue over fulfillment expense increased from 64% in q4 2019 to 76% in q4 2020. as a result, we are pleased to report the fifth consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense, which reached a record of eur 8.4 million in q4 2020. and now, on page 24, sales and advertising expense decreased by 34% from eur 15.5 million in q4 2019 to eur 10.2 in q4 2020. all marketing efficiency metrics are showing strong improvement.
sales and advertising expense per order decreased by 33% from eur 1.9 in q4 2019, down to eur 1.3 per order in q4 2020. annual sales and advertising expense per annual active consumer decreased by 48% from eur 9.2 per annual active consumer to eur 4.8, and sales and advertising as a percentage of gmv decreased by 88 basis points from 5.3% to 4.4%. these efficiencies are made possible by the strength of our brand. they are also attributable to continued enhancements in 2020, through our performance marketing strategy across search and social media channels, including through more granular segmentation for target markets, with differentiated campaigns and content for each segment.
finally, our third major cost area is technology and g&a. and we're now seeing meaningful improvements here as the rationalization efforts undertaken in 2019 and 2020 stopping us.g&a expense, excluding sbc, reached â¬21.8 million, down 36% year over year. this was partly a result of staff cost reduction and professional fees savings, largely attributable to the portfolio optimization and cost rationalization initiatives. moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items.
our profitability is further supported by our asset-light business model. capex in q4 2020 was eur 0.7 million, as we operate jumia logistics as a platform with very limited capex requirements. net change in working capital resulted in an outflow of eur 1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. and in fact, for the full-year 2020, working capital had an inflow effect of eur 9 million, thanks to improved receivables and payables cycles, as well as lower inventory needs.
cash utilization for the quarter, defined as cash using operating and investing activities, was eur 27.1 million in q4. this compares to a cash utilization of eur 52.9 million in q4 19 and represents the 49% increase year over year. cash and cash equivalents position at the end of december 2020 was eur 304.9 million. we completed a follow on offering in december 2020 as part of which we raised eur 203 million in gross proceeds, which helped us strengthen our balance sheet and increase operational flexibility, as we scale the business toward profitability.
with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you. so if we step back, once again, our strategy has been to build a sustainable platform to capture this great opportunity of e-commerce in africa and by sustainable wins, to bring those facts, those evidences that the business model positions us well to become profitable. and here, why is that so important to us? because, as we discussed in the past, we operate, what we think is a completely proven business model, very successful everywhere in the world, make every brand amazon. two, we have a great macro opportunity, we operate in a huge continent, which we see as untapped with amazing growth prospects.
and three, we have proven that we can operationally overcome the major challenges in africa, payments, logistics, consumer, and building a marketplace. and so, the only remaining point, the only remaining point is to make sure that as the business scales, it is profitable. and this is why for us, we are so engaged in this phase. and the facts, that i think we have been bringing over the last few quarters are, i think, very good, and they are very clear.
we have reduced our adjusted ebitda loss 47% last quarter. this was a clear objective and was delivered on it. two, we are making money, i would say, almost structurally after fulfillments. in 2019, we were not making money after fulfillment.
and now for five quarters in a row, we are doing that. the more usage of jumia, the more profit. i think it's pretty clear that the model works. three, we're still growing, and we are growing the profitable usage where we put our focus, the gmv, orders, post the cancellations in cftr, have been growing by 15% and 90% of all the business outside from electronics.
and we have grown the consumers by 12% this year. we have in q4, majority of our countries are now breakeven or profitable before taking d&a expense. and as you've seen the p&l dynamics, we're going to profitable usage. we are increasing the gross profit after fulfilments.
and we are doing this while decreasing g&a and sales and advertising. so we are in a very good position to reach breakeven if we continue to do that. this has been the strategy. this is what we are focusing on.
and this is what we intend to continue to do until the job is done on the tough stability question. at some point, we expect that we will have enough of those indisputable facts or, call it, profitability milestones to put the profitability question behind us. and at this point, we are going to invest more in order to accelerate the usage growth. and at that point in time, we will be very comfortable doing so.
we have a huge opportunity ahead. e-commerce, delivery, payments, logistics in africa, the continent with more than one billion people, we have an amazing platform to capture those opportunities. and with those recent results, we feel more confident than ever about the strengths of our business, as we are clearly seeing its financial performance coming together. thanks for listening in and we are now ready for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from aaron kessler with raymond james. please go ahead.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions, first from a macro perspective. what do you think will be the catalyst for maybe an inflection in e-commerce adoption across some of your key markets? we've, i believe, seen smartphone adoption increased meaningfully over the last couple of years, which has been a catalyst in other markets for more e-commerce adoption. so what do you think what's going to be the key catalyst over the next couple of years? and then, i think you mentioned leaning back into marketing a little bit.
should we start to see that in early 2021, late 2021? or how are you thinking about timing of leaning back into marketing? thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, aaron, thanks for the question. i think on the macro, in a way, we can call that the million-dollar question in some way. and what's important here is to share a few thoughts. number one, we did not build the business expecting or hoping an inflection.
we've built our business so that as we continue to scale, if there is never an inflection, that if we just continue to grow, it works out. it's not like we have yield ourselves, and we must hit that inflection point or that j-curve, or that hockey stick, or however you call it, we are geared so that if we continue gradually like this for the years to come, we will be in a very good place. so that's one thing, which is very important. secondly, what are today the barriers for the adoption of e-commerce, when you look at it, we have published some data and now it's since about a year ago, but i think it remains very true about the barriers to usage for the people who have never used e-commerce.
and we took in our largest market some people who have never shopped online, and we asked them, do you know jumia? and back then, we answer was 74% of the people knew jumia. we asked those people, do you consider trying, and 66% said that they were keen to try it. so, very good awareness, very good consideration. and then, when we asked them, why are you not shopping online, the three answers which were coming out the most were, because i don't know how to shop, because i don't think products are genuine, or because i cannot check the quality of the products.
and when we look at those facts, this consumer survey, the good news is that all these barriers are mental barriers, they are not infrastructure; it's not like people say, i don't have internet or i need something that i don't have, it's something which is getting used to it, becoming comfortable with it, gaining the trust to transact with the platform, understanding that, well, people can actually check the quality of the product with the reviews, they can return the product, and so on and so forth; so it's really about this education. now, having said those two things, we may hit an inflection point, there may be a point where suddenly a lot of people start buying online. and, for example, some people say that the generation which is digitally born -- today, the people who are 18 years old, 20 years old, they are now born with a mobile phone, and they will become prime consumer in our consumer targets, in maybe four, five, six, seven years. they will be comfortable, they will know how to shop, they will know how to check the quality of the product.
so those mental barriers, as the new generation enters into the consumer segment market, one can argue that all those young people, they will not have these barriers.and by this time, we may find this inflection point. but again, we can hope for that, we can construct it that for us, we do not -- let's say, we do not want to create a company that needs an inflection. no, we need to continue what we're doing. last 12 months, we had 7 million roughly consumers transacting on jumia, we operate in 11 markets where there are 600 million people and growing.
so there's a lot of consumers that we can go after. and if we have to continue for some time with the same growth, then i think we're in a very good place. if there's an inflection, even better. in terms of marketing, we manage it very dynamically.
and so, this is something that it's a bit hard to give, i think the points and whether i understand your question is, when do you answer this next phase where you feel more comfortable investing more for faster growth and when are you done with the focus on profitability? look, i think it's hard to tell, but certainly, we start to feel good about it. and when you look at the fact i mentioned, in the following fifth quarter in a row where we're making money on -- after fulfilments, a bunch of countries which are profitable before g&a, we're getting there. so i think a few more quarters that i think we're getting there.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.

the next question is from camille perrin with renaissance capital. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. two questions from me, please. firstly, could you comment on your growth outside phone and electronics category? i think it was about 15% of the cfdr, which last year -- which doesn't look particularly high, given the stage of market development.
so just wondering what prevents the faster growth in your view. and how do you see trends evolving going forward? that's the first one. and secondly, could you update us on the competitive situation in egypt? how does your growth that compared to the overall market or your main rival, and generally given tougher competitors there versus other countries? do you need to do anything differently in egypt, versus your other markets in terms of marketing investments or logistics, or anything else? that's it for me. thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks for those questions. and i think on the first one, over the quarters, and over the years, i've always wanted to appreciate the growth together with, i would say, equation of efficiency, both from a marketing efficiency and from a unit economic perspective. and i think on this us team that we have put a lot of emphasis on marketing efficiency. we've reduced the silver advertising by almost a third, by 34%, between the two quarters, and we are comparing with reduced.
and, of course, we'll increase the efficiency with that. so i think, one needs to appreciate that. and, as well, you know, the growth can be a function together with the marketing efficiency with i would say monetization pressure that you apply, right, you can see that our pass-through of the fulfillment expense to the consumers and the sellers has been continuously increasing. so, we are really being very disciplined in terms of free shipping, discounts, price subsidies, and marketing campaigns, and so on, so forth, right.
and i think we are definitely happy to see that we're growing 16%, considering the amount of efficiency improvements that we are generating in sales and advertising, as well as the amount of efficiency that we have driven from a gross profit perspective. and as we think about the future in, you know, when we enter the next phase, we think that we can relieve some of the efficiency constraints, right. and that, of course, the growth will go also faster. so i think it's an equation here and again, it has to be appreciated together with the other components of the equation.
when it comes to egypt and, of course, egypt is a very big focus for us, it's a market that we have been active for many years. and overall, we've been voluntarily explaining the digital is the second-largest market for us, close to nigeria. and definitely, we very much adapt our playbook to the competitive situation in egypt, in the sense that we do not go with the same marketing formula in a country where we have more competition than a country where we have less competition. we don't put the same pressure on unit economics, and we adapt, i would say to the competitive situation to a large extent, but most importantly, we adapt our business model, and we try to focus on adapting to the local specificities and our playbook, the jumia playbook and how we execute the business with the sellers, with the consumers, with the local stakeholders, with the brands the assortment in very adapted through the local specificities.
and i think for us, where egypt is our second-largest market and it's in our mind every morning and every night and every year, every minute and mature for our competitors the same focus right. and at the end of the day, we win e-commerce because you win the execution and you win because you have the right assortment, the right prices, the right brands, the right way to engage with the sellers, with the consumers, with the stakeholders.in egypt recently, we also launched jumia foods, which is our food delivery platform. so this is very new. this is for a couple of weeks now and we're launching it as we speak.
and so the consumers you know when we think about jumia they think about e-commerce, but they also think about jumiapay. there's lot of usage on jumiapay to make payments and utilities and so on. and they also now can use jumia food. and so as we bring this relevance to the consumers, this is also for us a differentiating factor for consumers to prefer using jumia.
unknown speaker
ok, great. thank you.

the next question comes from sarah simon with berenberg. please go ahead.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yes. hi. good afternoon, everybody. i got a few questions.
first one is on marketing spend in q4, obviously, it's stepped up versus q3 as you'd kind of expect to the seasonality. but customer growth didn't increase very significantly. so can you talk about what you spent the marketing money on? second one is, obviously, gross profit after fulfillment expenses growing very strongly. but even if you keep all of your fixed costs below the gross profit after fulfillment line flat, you need to basically increase that number by a multiple of four to get to breakeven, but you're not growing that fast at the moment.
so i'm just wondering how you weigh up the idea of a sort of steady path to breakeven, but maybe slightly further away versus a more aggressive growth push that would lose you more money more quickly, but probably get you there faster, because you don't have a balance sheet issue now, now that you've raised capital. and then just a question that you obviously highlighted, gdp sensitivity to the post sort of pandemic effects. would you agree, though, that the cause of the focus and the shift in emphasis toward more small and everyday items that you should be sort of less reliant on gdp are more resistant say to the economy, if you're selling small, everyday items, and if you're selling big mobile phones, for example? thanks.

thanks, sarah. and i think if we start with this one, i would agree with you right. and i think the fact that we are well-positioned on the everyday category is definitely positive and helps. at the same time, i mean, you see the share business from phones and electronics, i mean, it's still 43%.
right, in 2020, so there's definitely, for us and exposure to some high-value items. and i think the sentiment among the consumer, i mean, is what it is right now with all this uncertainty. so we'll see what happens. and i think we have proven in 2020, very clearly that, we have relevance for the, we are reflection, and of what the consumers do and spend.
and you can see how diversified -- we've been showing this in the previous release. we have a lot of exposure to fashion, fast-moving consumer goods, jumia foods, all now with the digital transactions, utility, etc. so we'll see what happens, i would agree with you. but at the same time, we still have exposure to high-value categories.
and if the market goes down in those categories, we'll see what happens. right. so i think generally agree with you, but those facts to keep in mind. now, on the marketing standard, first question and the increase, i think from the consumer growth we have to be always quite careful if you compare the spend of marketing between q3 and q4 and if you look at the last 12 months, consumers because you carry, of course, the last four quarters.
and you know, and when you compare the last four quarters, at the end of q3 is the last four quarters at the end of q4, there could be some dynamics from last year that you're carrying on. so in general, this is something that, you want needs to be just careful because you compare two quarters in the case. and in the other case, you compare two trailing 12 months period. so just to keep in mind -- and where we spend the marketing is very much a mix of data-driven, very programmatic, tech-driven, online marketing, which we use to drive both new users, new app users who are downloading the app.
and then, we add the spend to take them back to the platform until they can convert and then we use also that technique to bring back some old users and we call that retargeting specific users to bring them back to jumia so that they can discover new products or new categories, or and so on. and then we have a lot of local marketing and local engagement. and here, of course, we have our jforce program, which is very successful in many countries where we have the sales consultants and dozens of thousands of consultants for educating consumers in jumia and helping them discover and how to use it. we also have large networks of local and you can call that influencers, i guess that local key opinion leaders who are, posting videos about jumia and explaining to their users how to use it and how to check the quality of the products and all those things i mentioned to aaron about education.
and then every once in a while, for black friday, we have also some typical offline spend, billboards, and video campaigns on youtube or on tv and things like that. so it's how we do it. and usually, there's a spike of marketing toward the q4, as you pointed out. and then how do we get to profitability with the various aggregates? yes, of course, there's many ways we can get there as you as you pointed out, and when you look at the rate of growth of the gross profit after procurement versus the amount of cost, of course, you have to put the amount of cost in the dynamic way.
and you can see how those costs have been going down, right. so there's a possibility that those costs can go down, of course, and they're supposed to need to go there with a faster growth of gross profit after fulfillment, and this faster growth of the gross profit after procurement can come from, of course, more usage, right, more orders, more consumers, more gmv. but it also can come from more monetization of our platform assets. and typically, jumia advertising, typically, jumia logistics, the revenues that we drive from those, of course, when we bring revenue and they bring strong increase of the gross profit after fulfillment, even if it's not related to jumia consumer, right.
so i think we're very confident that we can accelerate the growth of the gross profit accessible payments, either through more usage, and or more revenue streams, which are not related to the usage, because we've been launching those, and two, we feel confident that we can either keep our cost stable or even if we have to, we can still take them down. so i think we have lots of ways to get there. and i think also, the point that we were trying to make is we're really focused on bringing the facts and the evidence of the past in proximity. right.
and that's what matters more to us than actually reaching proximity at group level. we want to be very comfortable to recover that, look, the model completely works. and the evidence and facts are very clear. and rather than saying we must absolutely breakeven for one full year at group level, it's more about continuing to bring those milestones, continuing to bring those evidences, so that there's not really [inaudible].
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
that's really helpful. can i ask one follow-up question, which is, sorry i forgot to ask initially? there's been quite a lot of chat about higher shipping costs coming out of china, higher freight costs. is that impacting the business at all? and if it is, how are you passing it on to the consumer?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, very good question. and, yes, you're seeing and our cross-border business from china wallet, you know, double-digit or 10% to 15% of the item sold. so that's how much we are talking about for jumia this cross-border business, and it's been working very well. and those increasing trade costs, of course, they are a problem, obviously, and they're not helping.
but at the same time look, that's why i say we are so diversified, and this is just one area of the business. so it's not been helping, definitely. and then we use a lot of data science to define the optimal pass-through of those trade costs, both to the consumers and to the sellers, right? and there's of course, a relationship between comments you pass to each and conversion rate of the item sold, and the perception also, and so this has been something that i would say is a constant optimization, when you have a certain amount of freight cost, you may decide to hide back ""into the price of the product"", or you sometimes want to put it as very identified freight cost. sometimes you want to give it more to the seller and to the consumer.
so it's, you know, long story short, it's a dynamic equation, which is very data-driven. but something that of course, is not helping and impacting but again, like you know, we are diversified, so it's something that we did not think was worth like commenting a piece for activity, but we are volunteering, of course, as an answer.

sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you. thank you very much, and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us today. before we go into the details of q1 performance, we would like to talk about our strategy.
we know that following our recent offering, this is an important question for our shareholders, and we would like to address it upfront. we founded jumia in 2012, nine years ago, with the vision to connect consumers and sellers and make commerce easier in africa. we spent the first few years understanding the dynamics of our markets, consumers, the sellers, logistics, payments, and we then built the jumia platform, which we think is uniquely adapted to the specifics of our markets. about three years ago, we decided to set the business on a clear path toward profitability.
and we chose to do that instead of growing and scaling as fast as we can because we wanted to make sure that as the business scales, it turns profitable. i believe we've made very good progress on this over the past 18 months. we have significantly diversified our category mix and increased our exposure to product categories that are very relevant to consumers as part of their daily lives. we have also increased the penetration of jumiapay to 26% of gmv, 37% of orders.
on profitability, we've now posted six consecutive quarters of positive gross profit after fulfillment. i think we can now confidently say that we are making money after logistics. for five consecutive quarters, we have been reducing our adjusted ebitda loss in absolute terms year over year. and we have also multiple countries, which are breakeven before tech and g&a expenses in a number of quarters.
and as you are well aware, all this progress has been achieved with no particular tailwind from covid-19. finally, of course, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, raising a total of $570 million in net proceeds over the past six months, which gives us very strong strategic flexibility. if we take a look at where we are today, we have in q1 an ebitda loss of eur 27 million, which is 20% less than a year ago. and if you look at the recent quarters, it's been very much under control.
that's what you see on page 4. and if you turn to page 5, you can see that our unit economics have completely changed between 2019, two years ago, and 2020 a year ago and where we are now. you can see that as we continue to drive the business toward everyday product categories, our order value is smaller, but the orders are much more profitable. gross profit margin as a percentage of gmv increased by 266 basis points.
fulfillment expense have gone down by one -- almost eur 1 in the last two years. our orders are now consistently generating positive contribution after fulfillment expenses. and we have a gross profit after fulfillment, which is standing at eur 0.90 in q1 2021. if you continue to go down, you see that those orders take much less marketing to generate we have increased the marketing efficiency, the sales and advertising per order by a factor of two since 2019.
we are very pleased with this progress in unit economics. and in a way, we are reaching now in q1 in points where for us, the focus is very clear. we are now in a very good position to accelerate usage growth. flipping to page 6, our priorities are: accelerate usage growth, continue to deliver profitability milestones and put more resources behind jumiapay.
what that means for the next few quarters. we will ramp up investments in sales and advertising as well as technology to support the usage growth and jumiapay. we're going to do that gradually. and with the same focus on categories that drive attractive consumer lifetime value and good economics, no big bank, if you will.
in terms of usage, it's pretty clear to us that we're going to grow faster on orders and consumers than on gmv. we believe that the everyday categories will continue to outgrow the other categories of jumia. also, the economic tensions generated by covid on the consumer spending will make consumers more focused on essentials, even more than they are now. we also have some currency fluctuations.
all those, they will for sure weigh on gmv growth. and as a result, the growth of orders and consumers, we think, will be greater than gmv. in terms of profitability, our focus is going to be on improving our profitability ratios. in the next few quarters, we're going to measure progress rather on ebitda as a percentage of gmv, ebitda per order than in absolute terms.
having said that, we still think that the total loss for 2021 will be lower than 2020, probably by a small margin. and finally, in the next few quarters, we will seek to bring the case study, the geographical case study of breakeven at local adjusted ebitda level. and last but not least, jumiapay where we intend to allocate more capital for the build-out of payment and financial solutions, both for sellers and consumers. this will not translate into capex.
we will continue to be capex-light from this perspective, but rather additional marketing, technology and g&a expenses allocated to the development of jumiapay. our business model has proven the success of companies like mercado libre, alibaba, amazon and all the other ones. i don't think there's any doubt about that. the potential of africa is huge.
and we think we are extremely well positioned to drive the adoption of e-commerce and payments. e-commerce in africa is very relevant in a continent where the distribution of goods and services is very challenging off-line. and i think we have proven that we can operationally overcome the major challenges in africa, payments, logistics. we've built a very scalable marketplace for consumers and sellers today; we will tell you a bit more about our great food delivery business.
and we have now significantly improved our unit economics, our costs are under control, and it's time now to grow faster. now, i hand over to jeremy, who is going to walk us through the performance of q1 in more details.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, sacha. hello, everyone. so, our focus in q1 was to drive the usage in a selective and thoughtful manner with a robust level of marketing efficiency. and that was and is made possible by the strength of the jumia brand in the countries where we operate.
and we had a very good illustration of the jumia brand strength with the result of the 2020 most influential brand survey in egypt that was released by ipsos in march this year. the survey is a global initiative. was conducted in egypt for the first time in 2020. and it assessed the brand's impact on egyptian consumers based on multiple dimensions, such as trustworthiness, leadership presence, leading edge.
jumia ranked seventh among 120 national and international brands in egypt and ranked no. 1 in the digital and e-commerce category in egypt. this high level of recognition by the consumer is a key enabler of our marketing efficiency, while our annual sales and advertising per annual active consumer declined by 46%, annual active consumers reached 6.9 million, up 7% year over year as we continue to acquire new consumers and engage existing ones. in the context of a decrease in the sales and advertising expense per order of 12%, total orders for the quarter reached eur 6.6 million, up 3% year over year.
this is a reversal of the declining trend observed over the prior two quarters. the fastest-growing categories in terms of volumes continue to be everyday product category, such as beauty, food delivery, fashion, while we continue to see volume declines in electronics albeit with a modest recovery observed in the phone category. as we reduced our sales and advertising spend by 9% year over year, gmv was down 13%, reaching eur 165 million in q1. it's also worth noting that the fx impact this quarter was material with the nigerian naira, the egyptian pound and the kenyan shilling declining 15%, 9% and 19%, respectively, against the euro in q1 2021 compared to q1 2020.
so, on a constant-currency basis, gmv was down 5% year over year, while sales and advertising expense was eur 8.8 million, down 1% year over year. our gmv mix continues to shift toward lower ticket size everyday product categories, which are affordable entry points into the jumia ecosystem, while ultimately supporting repurchase dynamics. so, on page 9, you can see that phones and electronics accounted for 30% -- 37%, sorry, of gmv in q1 2021 compared to 45% of gmv in q1 2020. in parallel, average order value decreased by 16% from eur 29.5 in q1 2020 to eur 24.9 in q1 2021, reflecting the shift toward those everyday categories.
while smaller in average value, our orders are also more profitable as gross profit after fulfillment expense per order more than doubled from eur 0.40 in q1 last year to eur 0.90 in q1 this year. in the context of this increased focus on every day and high-frequency categories, i'd like to give you more color on our food delivery and on-demand business. this is a strategic component of our ecosystem that has performed quite strongly over the past few years and where we see significant potential for future growth. on page 10, you see -- you can see that we have been operating this business since the inception of jumia in 2012.
and this is now a leading pan-african platform covering 10 countries and 48 cities. it is very much an urban model where we target cities with high density of population and restaurant supply. for the 12 months period ending in march 31, we had over 5,700 restaurants and other convenience outlets active on our platform. we have long-standing relationships with blue chips qsr franchisees such as mcdonald's, kfc, burger king, pizza hut, subway alongside local restaurant concepts as well as convenience outlets such as grocery shops and others.
it's a meaningful part of our business and accounted for 22% of orders and 9% of the gmv in q1 2021, and its share in the business has been growing over time, which speaks to the relevance of the food delivery for our consumers. on page 11, you can see that we built jumia as a comprehensive ecosystem of physical goods and digital services with multiple entry points for our consumers. with an average order value of around eur 10, food delivery and on-demand service has historically been an entry point for the more affluent consumer base that we seek to retain and reengage across the other parts of our ecosystem. we have observed that as we continue to expand our restaurant offering as well as the price point of this offering, we are now able to attract a more diverse consumer base.
our food delivery and on-demand services have been growing very strongly over the past three years. monthly orders on the platform have increased by a factor of more than four between january 2018 and march 2021, which demonstrates the relevance of this offering for our consumers. you can also see on the chart the effect of the start of the pandemic in africa with a strong dip in orders around april, may last year. however, the business has been quite resilient despite significant disruption from the curfews with orders rebounding above pre-pandemic levels starting from june last year.
overall, the food delivery and on-demand service are an important growth engine for the platform, and the key assets in terms of consumer acquisition and reengagement. it's also a key component of our program, jumia prime, that we have been testing over the past few quarters. jumia prime is a loyalty program as part of which consumers can set up a monthly subscription to get free delivery and access to a number of other benefits within the jumia ecosystem and from third-party partners. it's a great value proposition for consumers to have within the same program, both the food delivery as well as the e-commerce.
it is also a strong differentiator versus competition. the last aspect in relation to food delivery that i'd like to spend some time on, page 12, is a dedicated logistics infrastructure that we have built for this business and that has meaningful synergy potential with the rest of the platform. on page 12, you can see we operate a delivery-enabled marketplace model where 90%-plus of the orders placed are fulfilled through the jumia on-demand logistics infrastructure. similar to our physical goods logistics, we operate an asset-light model for on-demand delivery, leveraging the fleet and the drivers of around 140 third-party logistic partners.
we have a dedicated tech stack that supports all on-demand logistics workflows, including restaurants and point-of-sales module, smart order assignment and delivery associates scheduling, customer interface, etc. this strong tech backbone, alongside tried and tested logistics processes and infrastructure allow us to continuously reduce our average delivery time, which stood at 40.5 minutes in q1. this is a remarkable achievement when you keep in mind the traffic and the road conditions of the larger frequent cities where we operate. and we intend to further decrease delivery time as we continuously improve our machine learning algorithm to better manage each step of the delivery experience.
as part of this focus on continuously improving customer experience, we see increased convergence of e-commerce and on-demand delivery. the on-demand logistics infrastructure we beat is a tremendous asset to develop a few commerce propositions and offer consumers on-demand delivery for a broader range of fmcg and everyday items. we are already working with large retail chains as well as smaller outlets to offer grocery and fresh product delivery, and we believe this is an also another very exciting area for future growth. we are very excited by the momentum we are seeing in our food delivery business as well as its future growth prospects.
i now would like to move on another strategic area of our business, jumiapay on page 14. the tpv increased by 21% from eur 35.5 million in q1 last year to eur 42.9 million in q1 this year. on a constant-currency basis, tpv in q1 this year was up 35% year over year. jumiapay penetration as a percentage of gmv increased from 18.7% last year to 26% this year.
on the next page, jumiapay transactions increased by 7% from 2.3 million in q1 last year to 2.4 million in q1 this year. jumiapay transactions above eur 10, which include prepaid purchase on the jumia physical good marketplace and jumia food platforms, increased by 30%. jumiapay transactions below eur 10, which mostly consists of transactions on jumiapay app, declined by 3%. this trend was concentrated in the airtime recharge category as we reduced consumer incentives within this category, which has historically been promotionally intensive.
overall, 36.7% of order placed on the jumia platform in q1 this year were completed using jumiapay compared to 35.5% last year. beyond the payment processing activities that we capture in the tpv and transactions, jumiapay also functioned as a financial service marketplace for both consumers and sellers. for sellers and sme sellers in particular who have historically been underserved by financial institutions, jumiapay leveraged their business data for credit scoring purpose and connect them to financial institution who offer them short-term loans and working capital financing. in q1, this year, 380 loans were disbursed as part of this activity, 90% more than q1 last year.
these loans were allocated to 291 unique sellers, 62% more than in q1 last year. it is synergistic with our marketplace activities as it helps fund the inventory needs of our sellers but is also very much in line with our mission of leveraging technology to empower smes and help them grow their business. i now hand over to antoine, who will walk you through our financial performance into more detail.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeremy. hello, everyone. let's start with our monetization metrics. in q1 '21, marketplace revenue was up 6% and gross profit up 11%.
fx headwinds mentioned earlier by jeremy affected materially these figures. on a constant currency basis, marketplace revenue was up 16%, while gross profit was up 21% year over year. taking a closer look at our various marketplace revenue streams on slide 18, we can see that commissions increased by 9% year over year due to an increase in the share of higher commission rate categories, including fashion, beauty or food delivery. fulfillment revenue increased by 11% as a result of pricing changes within our cross-border logistics, where we were initiated in the second half of 2020.
as part of these changes, part of the international shipping fees that were previously charged to sellers were instead passed on to consumers. this change resulted in some of our international logistics revenue being recorded as fulfillment revenue instead of revenue from value-added services. that is also what drove the 13% decline in value-added services. marketing and advertising revenue increased by 36% year over year.
this is a result of the robust takeup by advertisers, both jumia sellers and third parties of jumia advertising solutions as we continue to improve the relevance and user experience of our ad solutions. as part as our efforts to continuously diversify our monetization streams and extract value from the broader asset of our platform, we piloted last year the opening of jumia logistics to third parties. on the back of the positive result of this pilot, we rolled out these services more broadly in q1 '21. during the quarter -- i am now on page 19, over 750,000 packages were delivered more than the total handled in 2020 as part of the pilot.
we worked with over 250 logistics as a service client, and i'd like to go through some examples to give you a sense of the diversity of the clients we work with. in kenya, jumia was appointed as preferred logistics partner for weetabix to undertake their deliveries to modern trade across kenya. in ivory coast, we work for zeci solar panel, which is a jv between zola electric, an american off-grid electricity company and electricitã© de france, the french utility company. the jv provides solar power to rural communities and a means to eradicating poverty.
jumia logistics offered to give the storage and distribution of solar panels from abidjan to up-country households. in nigeria, we work with zaron, which is a leading cosmetics brand in west africa. jumia logistics provides delivery services for their customer orders across nigeria, whether these orders were placed within or outside the jumia platform. we also do full truckload transportation to support in the distribution within lagos and the southwest region.
the diversity of the clients we work with speaks to the large addressable market we have for logistics services. pretty much every industry and service sector faces logistics pain points in africa, and we are uniquely positioned to help address these pain points which makes it a meaningful potential revenue stream going forward. moving on to costs on page 21. we have done a lot of work on costs over the past 18 months, driving strong efficiencies throughout the p&l.
gross profit after fulfillment expense reached eur 6.2 million, increasing by a factor of 2.5 compared to q1 '20. this is our sixth consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense. fulfillment expense decreased by 11% on a currency-adjusted basis and by 3% on a constant-currency basis, while orders increased by 3% in q1 2021 compared to q1 2020. this was mostly a result of fulfillment staff cost savings as well as the change in our delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stock which was implemented starting from the second quarter of 2020.
in addition, we were able to pass on an increasing proportion of our fulfillment expense, the combination of consumers and sellers via our fulfillment and value-added services revenue streams, respectively. the pass-through of our fulfillment expense measured as the ratio of the sum of fulfillment and value-added services revenue over fulfillment expense, increased from 69% in q1 '20 to 78% in q1 '21. i would like to spend a few minutes on the strategic asset of our platform, which is our pickup station network on page 22. pickup stations are physical locations where consumers can come to collect their packages.
this growing network is a huge asset for us, which goes way beyond logistics. our pickup stations are jumia branded locations almost entirely operated by third-party partners. we have today over 1,600 stations in our network. and in q1 2021, 23% of packages were delivered to pick up stations, while the rest was door delivered.
let me tell you all these pickup stations drive convenience, cost efficiency while being a powerful asset for the development of an online to off-line or o2o strategy as well as the development of jumiapay. in terms of convenience, many consumers actually prefer to go and collect their packages rather than have someone come with the package to their home or office. it's a great alternative for consumers when ordering on jumia. we also charge cheaper delivery fees so consumers can also save money on delivery fees.
in terms of cost efficiency, pickup stations are great as they are on average, cheaper for us than door delivery. with respect to o2o, pickup stations served as a bridge between the digital ecosystem and the off-line daily life of our consumers. they are the touch points that brings the jumia brand closer to consumers while creating further trust in our brand because consumers start to see jumia as an integral part of their local communities. we are also increasingly leveraging them as ordering points where consumers can place orders with the help of a pickup station staff which helps educate consumers.
in some cases, jforce agents helped drive footfall to the ordering points and assist with the education process of consumers. we have included in our release a case study of all pickup stations helped expand our penetration beyond primary cities in ivory coast. to support equitable economic development, and the inclusion of secondary cities and rural areas, we established a scalable pickup station model in partnership with cdc, the u.k.'s development finance institution. these outlets sale as both pickup stations and ordering points.
they are operated by local entrepreneurs who earn an income from the delivery fees and the commissions on orders placed from the outlet. this is a great illustration of the impact we can have on the inclusion of consumers in remote areas as well as job creation. lastly, we intend to leverage our network of pickup stations for the future development of the e-wallet activities of jumiapay, whether it's cash-in, cash-out transactions or over-the-counter everyday services such as airtime recharge and utility bill payments. moving on to sales and advertising costs.
sales and advertising cost expense decreased by 9% from eur 8.9 million in q1 '20 and to eur 8.1 million in q1 '21. on a constant currency basis, sales and advertising expense was down 1% year over year. we continue to make progress on the marketing efficiency metrics. although sales and advertising as a percentage of gmv increased by 21 basis points from 4.7% to 4.9%, we continued to make good progress on per order and per consumer basis.
sales and advertising expenses per order decreased by 12% from eur 1.4 in q1 2020 to eur 1.2 per order in q1 '21. and annual sales and advertising expense per annual active consumers decreased by 44% from eur 8.2 per annual active consumer to eur 4.6. these efficiencies are a result of continued programmatic marketing improvement with better targeted and more engaging campaigns across social media and search engines. as mentioned by sacha at the beginning of the call, we expect to gradually increase our sales and advertising expense to drive further usage growth, leveraging the strong unit economics we have achieved.
finally, our third major cost is technology and g&a. g&a expense, excluding sbc, reached eur 20.3 million down 17% year over year. this decrease was attributable to staff cost savings as a result of the portfolio optimization and headcount rationalization initiatives launched in the first quarter of 2020, alongside a decrease in professional fees, including legal expense. moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items, our path to profitability is further supported by our asset-light business model.
capex in q1 '21 was eur 0.4 million as we operate jumia logistics as a platform with very limited capex requirements. net change in working capital resulted in an outflow of eur 4.8 million in q1 '21. we have seen a decrease in payables in q1 '21 due to a shorter payable cycle and the payment of -- in q1 of black friday-related invoices from q4 '20. cash utilization for the quarter defined as cash used in operating and investing activities, was eur 29.7 million in q1 '21.
this compares to a cash utilization of eur 39.6 million in q1 '20 and represents a 25% decrease year over year. cash and cash equivalent position at the end of march '21 was eur 485.6 million. this includes approximately eur 205 million of the total gross proceeds from the offering completed on march 30, with a remaining eur 88 million of cash received in april '21. having significantly strengthened our balance sheet we now have the flexibility to further invest behind growth and accelerate the development of some of our strategic initiatives, including payment and financial services for consumers and sellers.
with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, antoine. thank you, guys. just final thoughts before questions. everything we've done over the past couple of years and what we intend to do going forward is geared toward capturing this huge market opportunity we see in e-commerce and payment in africa.
we're very focused on the long term, and we strongly believe that the platform we have built is uniquely adapted to our markets to win in the long term. we're constantly improving and strengthening our value proposition to better serve the consumers and the sellers. today, we talked about the pickup station network, which i think many of you may not know about. also, our food delivery business, which probably some of you did not know about and both of which are great illustrations of the strategic assets that we have and how we can offer more convenience to our consumers, bring jumia even closer to them and be at the heart of the communities.
the situation is pretty simple. our unit economics in q1 are very good. they are outstanding, i think. all the work that we've done on monetization, cost efficiency is really paying off.
we've been making money now for six consecutive quarters after fulfillment. we're seeing many countries getting closer to breakeven at local level. we've been consistently reducing our adjusted ebitda loss in absolute terms, on a year-over-year basis, and that's for five quarters now. and all this is what we said we would do, and we are pleased with those results.
and the path ahead is also very clear, we want to accelerate growth across the platform to take the business further on its path to profitability. and i think as we have said a little bit in the call, we are quite clear on what we will do and we will not do. we will not seek to grow at any cost. the way we will drive the growth will continue to be disciplined, thoughtful guided by the needs of our consumers, the relevance for our markets, and we are focused on growing the users.
the orders, probably more than the gmv, but also the gmv in a very thoughtful manner. and we're not going to do any big bank. right? we're going to drive increase in sales and advertising and technology expenses in a gradual manner. right? before any large-scale deployment of product or initiatives, we always conduct ab tests, pilots.
that's why we have lots of countries we can use a handful of countries to test pilot and to establish proof of concept before we do any broader rollout in this framework of development and investments will remain unchanged. the mindset of discipline will also apply in the way we develop jumiapay. and an important part of the investments in jumiapay are allocated to compliance, risk management processes. and we view those investments as essential infrastructure to scale jumiapay services, on platform and off platform.
and as we introduce new services and solutions, which we will do in a gradual manner, we will continue to drive those investments. in summary, we're very excited by the opportunity and both on e-commerce and payments. and we are very confident that we have the platform and the people, the resources to capture this opportunity, and further strengthen the competitive moats that we've built. thank you very much for the attention, and we are now very happy to take questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from aaron kessler from raymond james. go ahead.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. a couple of questions. first, just maybe on the seasonality.
it looks like it's a little bit more than we expected from q4 to q1 in terms of marketplace revenues. is that -- was that primarily just seasonality? or were there other headwinds, whether it's covid or something else in the quarter? and then, the 1p revenues as well was a little bit lower. i know that's kind of an intentional shift away from 1p revenues. is that kind of a new base level we should be looking at for those revenues, or do you think that continues to drift down from where it is really shifting out of 1p at this point? and then finally, just maybe just use of cash, and congrats on the recent equity raises.
i know you talked about maybe it gives you some flexibility to invest in some new areas or continue to invest. any specific areas you would call out that you're focused on investing with that increased cash position.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, aaron. thank you very much. look, no particular seasonality in q1, i would say. right? it's a quarter that is obviously the beginning of the year.
and this year, nothing really special. so, i think that's on that. i think the ramadan this year started sometime in mid-april, and at some point, it's coming earlier every year. so, maybe next year, there will be an impact from that because sometimes it drives a specific consumer behavior.
but i would say, nothing special to call out this year, honestly. on the 1p, it's interesting. it's a very good question. we've been very clear that for us, there's no particular objective in terms of how small or how big do we want 1p to be, and we are primarily focused on building a marketplace.
but 1p is very useful and very important for us because it's a strategic way sometimes to engage in certain categories. and for example, sometimes if there is a shortage of supply, or if there is a seller who does not carry certain goods, which are very relevant to the consumers, we are able to act as the seller. right? and it's a very helpful tool, if you will, for us to address the consumer relevance, and we feel pretty good about where we are. right? for now, a number of quarters, it's been anywhere around 10%, plus or minus, right, of our gmv.
and it's a level that is -- that we are comfortable with. and it may increase in the future as well. right? we're not solving to make it particularly lower than this. and it could be that if we see a shortage of supplies or supply disruptions, that we decide to drive a little bit more 1p.
so, again, for us, what's important is that 1p remains a minority of the transactions in the gmv. but we feel good with the current level for q1. in the future, it may go up if we feel that's necessary, and it's something that we know how to do. we have the know-how to operate certain level of 1p.
so, i think it's a good thing for us to be able to do that. in terms of use of cash, in the next few quarters, we're going to be extremely focused on our core business. right? so really e-commerce. and by e-commerce, we mean the physical goods marketplace and food delivery, for us, that's e-commerce.
and then, jumiapay. right? so all our resources are focused on those in order to continue to drive good path to profitability and to accelerate the growth of the usage and develop some new services for jumiapay. and within that, of course, there's a lot of innovations and new products and new features and new services that we are working on. but i would say, clearly, clearly, clearly, within this core mandate.
right? and same thing geographically, we're extremely focused on our 11 countries with no intention to go anywhere in the near future. and then, as we see the growth accelerates and the path to profitability continue, we may reassess that, but for the foreseeable future, extremely focused on the core e-commerce for physical goods, food delivery and jumiapay. and of course, i don't mention logistics for us is a core part of the platform, which is empowering the core. so, some investments there as well.
but overall focus on the core.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. maybe finally, just can you briefly talk about the overlap. you mentioned the food delivery and on-demand, the overlap between food delivery and core retail that you're seeing or maybe how that's increasing.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, very much, it's fascinating to see the overlap growing with time. and you can see -- you can take a few angles to think about this overlap. you see, one, more consumers are starting to use both. right? and in the past, for us, we were observing that the food delivery business tended to be for the upper middle class.
the people who can afford to go to a restaurant. right? and of course, then they can afford to order a restaurant at home. and we're seeing more and more of our historical consumers from the physical goods marketplace also discovering that service as they find it attractive. and also, as we have more and more restaurants, which -- to choose from.
there is a big overlap also in terms of vendors. right? we have many of our vendors want to be able to offer a 30-minute delivery, and they want to be able to also offer e-commerce nationwide. right? many of the fmcg grocery players, they think about newcomers in a way to where you can reach consumers and give them something that is immediate, a purchase that maybe is unplanned and more impulsive and a convenience purchase. right? so it's a great channel for the vendors to address this impulse, convenience and instant delivery.
but of course, you also want to be shipping goods on the other side of the country with a few days' delay and we want to be able to serve the needs of the consumers who are not in the big cities, they're outside the big cities. and also, for purchases, which are maybe less planned -- or maybe more planned, i should say, and more prepared. right? so the vendors are extremely eager to explore both platforms as a way to address two different consumer needs. and then, from a logistics perspective, obviously, having the ability to deliver very, very fast in the big cities is a very strong competitive advantage for us to use for the e-commerce deliveries, but also to use for the monetization of jumia logistics.
and today, we offer the jumia logistics as a service to third parties, and we mainly focus today on giving them those clients last-mile delivery and more e-commerce traditional deliveries and which time we will expand this to instant delivery. so, it's overall very attractive. and last but not least, it makes our subscription program very attractive, right, which is a competitive advantage as well because the members of the jumia prime program they have advantages both for the e-commerce but also for the food delivery. and that is, of course, very attractive because then it creates more reasons for consumers to use both.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from lamont williams from stifel. go ahead.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey. first question i had was on this food delivery unit economics. can you talk a little bit about how the unit economics on the food delivery and on-demand compares with some of the traditional e-commerce business? and then could you also just talk about the competitive landscape in food delivery?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, of course. i think the unit economics for us have been pretty attractive, i would say, and definitely contributing to the good results that you have seen in our unit economics over the last few quarters. the average basket size is -- it differs by country, but even the, let's say, low double digit. right? so between eur 10 and eur 15 depending on the month, depending on the cities, etc., but that's more or less what we're talking about.
and then, you have commission levels, which have been varying, of course, by countries, but they are generally above -- or around 20%. right? so that's more or less what we've been seeing. and then, the logistic costs are, of course, tend to be lower than e-commerce. right? so because it's more instant delivery.
in e-commerce, we have quite a significant share of the businesses outside the big cities, and it's also sometimes in the rural area. right? so you have to deleverage it. when we look at the average in the big city, you have a cost which is pretty similar. right? so when we look at the cost of delivering a pair of shoes on a next-day basis in lagos, for example.
and when we look at the cost of delivering a pizza in 30 minutes, it's pretty comparable. right? and generally, most of the orders they include what we call a shipping fee. so, the consumers are participating to this logistic cost. so, all in all, it's an attractive business from a unit economic perspective.
and in terms of competition, there's quite a number of players who are acting in our countries of operations. in some of them, you have some historical player who have been there even before we were there. you have a few international players who are active in certain markets like uber eats or glovo. and you have also a lot of the ride-hailing companies who have tried to enter into ride hailing some local companies doing better are attempting to expand into food delivery because it's obviously a very natural expansion as we all know.
and so, yes, it's a rather competitive offering. but i think we're very well positioned because we have the jumia brand, obviously, which is huge, and we benefit from all those investments. we've been doing this business for 10 years, which is a lot. i don't know any player multi-country who has done it for longer than us.
and we've got a lot of experience and we've got the scale of the infrastructure of jumia to leverage, right, the brand, the logistics, the payments, the consumer base, the relationship with advertisers, the relationship with the restaurants, the jumia prime subscription model. so, it's -- for us, it's something that we feel very strong about. and we think that we have a very competitive and very effective value position for consumers and for restaurants.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
our next question is from edgar durkee from blackrock. go ahead.
unknown speaker -- blackrock -- analyst
hello and thanks for taking my question. i've got only two quick questions. the first is, can you just explain your increase in trade and other receivables from eur 10 million to roughly eur 100 million. and then, the second is on your gmv, it's just a technical question.
does the eur 165 million you quote, is that gross of returns, discounts and vouchers or net? and if it's gross, please, can you provide the net number?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you for the question. probably antoine, you should take those please?
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
yeah, i can take both. in the increase of receivable includes the third tranche of the offering that we made in may, and that was collected received in april. it accounts for usd 88 million. the revenues we are showing all net of vouchers.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
i think maybe your question. the first one is like cash basically and --
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's no cash for sure. no, it's not cash.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by. welcome to jumia's results conference call for the second quarter of 2021. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to safae damir, hesead of investor relations for jumia.
please go ahead.
safae damir -- head of investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today for our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. with us today are sacha poignonnec and jeremy hodara, co-founder and co-ceos of jumia, as well as antoine maillet-mezeray, cfo.
this call is also being webcast on the ir section of our corporate website. we will start by covering the safe harbor. we would like to remind you that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
moreover, these forward-looking statements may speak only to our expectations as of today. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. for a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements expressed today, please see the risk factors section of our annual report on form 20-f as published on march 12, 2021. in addition, on this call, we will refer to certain financial measures not reported in accordance with ifrs.
you can find reconciliations of these non-ifrs financial measures to the corresponding ifrs financial measures in our earnings press release, which is available on our investor relations website. i also would like to cover two housekeeping points. all our numbers will be presented in u.s. dollar going forward as a result of functional and presentation currency changes from the euro to the u.s.
dollar effective april 1, 2021. for convenience purposes, q2 2021 results highlight in euro have been provided in the appendix of this presentation. i also would like to point out that all our growth rates we will mention in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. with that, i'll hand over to sacha. 
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, safae. welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. our results for q2 reflect what we have announced during our last call -- increased investments in our platform to support our objectives of driving accelerated usage growth, as well as jumiapay. jeremy will walk you through in a moment the detailed results, but i can already say that we have started to increase our investments in sales and advertising, as well as technology expense to support our long-term growth.
we've had the fastest growth of transactions of the last five quarters. this is early momentum that we want to build on to accelerate even more. and we have a great milestone on jumiapay that allows us to process third-party payments. this focus on usage growth in jumiapay is now possible because our fundamentals are very strong to support our long-term growth and also ensure that as the business scales, it turns profitable.
i would like to remind how much the business has changed over the last years on page three. first, our marketplace has never been more diverse and relevant for our consumers. the share of gmv from everyday product categories is now 63%. it was 41% two years ago.
this diversification has been in the making for many years as we've been working on the supply side of our marketplace, developing partnerships with brands and sellers, which put us in a position to make significant inroads in those categories. secondly, we have transformed our unit economics. gross profit margin stands at 12% of gmv, almost doubling over the past two years. we've been generating positive gross profit after fulfillment for now seven quarters in a row.
and obviously, this is very important because we have now set unit economics at a level that gives us the flexibility to invest much more behind growth. and finally, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, raising over $570 million of cash over the past nine months, and this gives us the firepower to fund our growth investments. all this, as we've discussed in the past, was achieved with no particular tailwind from covid. so our focus going forward is very clear, scale the platform and develop jumiapay.
on page three, here's how we are executing across all areas of the business to serve these two objectives. we are ramping up marketing investments to drive even more brand awareness, support consumer education with a view to, of course, accelerate consumer acquisition and retention. here, we want to drive both e-commerce and payment adoption. our commercial efforts aim to provide the broadest and most relevant range of products and services with a focus on everyday categories.
these categories cover physical goods like fmcg, grocery, fashion, beauty, but also lifestyle services, such as food delivery, grocery delivery, digital services offered on the jumiapay app. our logistics operations are focused on constantly reducing delivery times and further increasing the network reach and convenience for consumers. and last but not least, technology is the backbone of all our operations and key to support user engagement and conversion rates. we are aiming to increase our tech headcount by 40% by the end of the year and in particular, expand our newly launched tech hub in the city of cairo in egypt.
it is a very exciting time for us at jumia with a busy pipeline of projects and innovation that will significantly enhance each step of the consumer journey and allow us to better serve both consumers and sellers. and i'll now hand over to jeremy, who will walk you through the performance of q2 in more detail and dive deeper into some of the initiatives i just mentioned.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, sacha. hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. let's start with the review of the usage trends during the quarter. we're on page six.
as sacha mentioned, we are very focused on accelerating the usage growth. and in this context, q2 of this year was really a transition quarter where we ramped up our sales and advertising expense after six quarters of reduced marketing spend. now, what has changed versus last year is that we have built sufficient strength in our unique economics to allow us to invest more into growth. first, we are seeing early signs of acceleration in the business, with the orders reaching $7.6 million, increasing by 13% year over year, which was the fastest volume growth of the past five quarters.
when we look at the details of volume growth by product category, we are seeing areas of strong momentum emerging very clearly. food delivery was the fastest-growing category on our platform in volume terms, posting the highest-ever number of quarterly orders, up almost 60% and accounting for 22% of total orders on our platform during the quarter. food delivery is the first area of the business where we deployed our growth acceleration in force late last year to reignite the usage growth following the disruption on the onset of the pandemic. the annual active consumers reached 7 million, up 3% as we continue to acquire new consumers and engage existing ones.
gmv was usd 23.5 million, down 11% on a currency adjusted basis. in terms of trends by product category, we continue to see diversification of gmv in favor of everyday category. on page seven, you can see that phone and electronics went from accounting for 43% of the gmv in q2 last year to 33% of the gmv in q2 this year. phone and electronics categories continue to see gmv decline during the quarter due to multiple factors, including supply disruption with global chipset shortage, alongside muted consumer demand due to the high-ticket-size, discretionary nature of this item.
in contrast, everyday category and lifestyle services, in particular, are experiencing very strong momentum. under the lifestyle services umbrella, we include both food delivery and digital services offered in the jumiapay app. these categories are accounting for an increased share of gmv, contributing 14% in q2 this year compared to 9% q2 last year. the fastest-growing category in gmv was the financial and digital services offered via jumiapay.
this category posted its largest-ever quarterly gmv in q2 this year, up more than 60% compared to last year, which itself was a strong quarter, up 56% compared to q2, two years ago. on the physical front -- physical goods front, sorry, the fastest-growing category in gmv terms was fashion, which continues to be the largest category volume-wise on our platform. i would also like to call out the grocery and consumable category, which is among the categories of focus for us. here, we are leveraging both our on-demand and e-commerce platforms to meet the variety of consumer needs in this space.
our e-commerce platform caters to larger grocery basket size for planned purchases. we have accelerated the pace of seller and brand onboarding in this category. in q2 this year alone, we onboarded over 780 fmcg brands and sellers, taking the count of live product listings in this category from approximately 65,000 end of june last year to almost 100,000 end of june this year. through our on-demand platform, jumia food, consumers can make add-on purchases of grocery and fmcg items from convenience outlets and supermarkets for delivery within one hour.
we are also piloting the use of dark stores or micro fulfillment centers located in high population density areas for the fulfillment of grocery orders. this is a strategic category for us because it drives user engagement and stickiness. and we have the relevant logistics platform and supply relationships to offer consumers a compelling value proposition in this category. while we're encouraged to see early signs of acceleration in the business and multiple pockets of strong momentum, we have significant opportunity to meaningfully accelerate today's growth on our platform.
and i'd like to give you more color on what we are doing on the marketing and technology front to drive this usage acceleration. these initiatives are informed by consumer insights, as well as multiple pilots conducted over the past few months. on page eight, starting with marketing, we are ramping up our marketing investments across below and above the line to drive consumer acquisition and retention. we have highlighted here selected initiatives we are implementing across these channels.
our below-the-line activities are focused on online performance channels, such as google and facebook, and cover all phases of our consumer journeys, starting from brand awareness, more customer targeting, app installs, as well as we're targeting returning consumers. we are increasing the overall amount of marketing spend on these channels in 2021 compared to 2020, leveraging the efficiency learnings of last year. we are also -- we also intend to implement a full funnel approach, particularly on facebook that goes beyond direct response ads and includes more brand awareness campaigns with more engaging video content targeted toward relevant audiences. lastly, we plan to further scale our social media influencers channel on the back of the success of this channel as a consumer education and acquisition tool in certain countries, such as egypt.
above the line channels. we are increasing our overall investment in offline marketing channels to drive even more brand visibility and consumer education with always-on above the line campaign. we are also leveraging geo-targeting tools to identify under-penetrated areas and launch targeted out-of-home advertising campaign. lastly, we are deploying more targeted consumer incentives, enhancing our consumer engagement strategy with the rollout of our new crm growth tool.
we have developed and piloted the crm tool based on machine learning algorithms that allows us for more refined audience targeting and more tailored push-notification content, allowing us to both reduce opt out and drive usage uplift. there is no single silver bullet with respect to marketing. it all comes down to granular and disciplined execution across each and every step of the consumer journey. that's really the spirit of our approach.
moving on to technology on page nine. tech is the backbone of our platform, and we are increasing our investment in this area to build more products and features to enhance user experience and engagement on our platform. we are planning to increase our tech headcount by 40% by the end of the year, with a focus on our newly launched tech hub in cairo, egypt. our cairo hub will host over 100 tech professionals and will include dedicated teams to front-end projects.
we highlighted a few examples of such projects on this slide. we plan to increase the personalization of our on-site content, including homepage, product, widgets, search, etc. our consumer customers are responding very well to gamified content. and we plan to enhance our daily and weekly animations with dedicated teams of gamification content creation, flash sales and branding campaign.
last but not least, we are planning to start developing selected social commerce features, such as user-generated content, including video/picture upload and reviews and more content features for sellers and influencers. these investments are long term in nature, and we expect them to pay out over time as we execute on our acceleration strategy. let's now turn to jumiapay on page 11, which forms an integral part of our acceleration strategy. we have been consistent in our vision for jumiapay, which is to first develop our payment and fintech solutions within the jumia platform and ultimately offer them off platform to third party.
we are pleased to announce a major step toward off-platform payment development in egypt. national bank of egypt, the largest state-owned bank in egypt, obtained an approval in principle from the central bank of egypt to offer certain services in partnership with the services of payment service provider, payment facilitation and payment aggregator. and they will allow us to process payment off-platform on behalf of third-party merchants in egypt. this is the very first step in the expansion of our services off-platform, and we'll keep you updated on the relevant developments on this front as we build out these activities.
on the digital and financial services side, we continue to expand the range of relevant services available to consumers on the jumiapay app, adding 19 new services in q2 this year. in morocco, for example, the jawaz solution is now available to consumers on the jumiapay app, allowing them to recharge their highway toll fees on the jumiapay app without the need to stop at physical tolls on their journey. moving on to the jumiapay performance in q2 on page 12. while tpv decreased by 4% on both constant currency and currency adjusted base, in parallel with the decrease in gmv, on-platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of gmv increased to 25.3% in q2 this year from 23.5% in q2 last year.
and we are pleased to see that multiple countries within our footprint have reached significant higher penetration rate with nigeria and egypt, surpassing 40% of tpv penetration as a percentage of gmv in the first half of 2021. moving on to volumes on page 13. jumiapay transactions increased by 12%, the fastest transaction growth rate of the past four quarters. jumiapay transaction growth was supported by accelerating volume growth in the business with particularly strong momentum in the food delivery category.
overall, 35.4% of orders placed on the jumia platform in the second quarter of 2021 were completed using jumiapay compared to 35.6% in the second quarter of 2020. there is meaningful runway for us to further grow jumiapay, both on and off platform. and our increased investment in marketing and technology includes a portion for jumiapay to drive payment adoption and support product development. i now hand over to antoine, who will walk you through our financial performance in more detail.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you. hello, everyone. i'll start with our monetization metric. in q2 '21, marketplace revenue was up 1% and gross profit up 4%.
our gross profit margin as a percentage of gmv continued to expand year over year from 10.2% in q2 2020 to 12% in q2 '21. let's unpack this trend by looking at the details of each marketplace revenue stream on page 16. having achieved a robust level of unit economics with gross profit after fulfillment at usd 1 per order, we made the deliberate choice to reinvest some of this profitability back into growth. as part of that, we took targeted actions to support usage growth, increasing consumer price incentives and shipping discounts.
this drove a decrease in commissions and fulfillment revenue by 7% and 2%, respectively. on the other hand, value-added services revenue increased by 10%, the fastest growth rate of the past six quarters. this was the result of increased volumes on our platform, which led to higher shipping contributions collected from sellers. it was also supported by increased take-up by sellers of our warehousing services particularly cross-border sellers, who leverage on our local storage facilities to reduce delivery times for consumers.
as we ease the monetization intensity on the commissions and fulfillment revenue, we are ramping up new monetization streams to give us further flexibility to invest into growth. one of these streams is marketing and advertising, which increased by 18% in q2 '21, supported by robust growth of our sponsored product ad solutions. we are constantly enhancing the user experience and relevance of our ad products to drive increased click-through rates. and we do so through better audience segmentation, innovative ad placement and overall improved ad operations and analytics.
another key monetization stream for us is our logistics offering to third parties on page 17. this is an offering we rolled out in early '21 on the back of a successful pilot in 2020. this activity is experiencing very strong momentum with a record 1.3 million packages delivered in q2 '21 compared to 0.5 million packages in the full-year 2020 on behalf of over 300 clients. our clients span a very broad range of sectors, and we have let out on the page a few examples of logistics as a service clients we worked with during the quarter.
in ivory coast, we collaborated with the unicef for the delivery of over 16 million long-lasting impregnated mosquito net to households across over 100 remote health districts. in ghana, we worked with fareast mercantile limited, which is a leading fmcg distribution company with a portfolio of over 1.5 skus across africa. we collaborated with the group for line haulage services to their customers in ghana. in nigeria, we worked with wema bank, a fully digital bank offering them card-product delivery to customers across nigeria via road and air freight.
we are very encouraged by the strong momentum in our logistics as a service offering. and we intend to continue building up this business to meet the logistic needs of a broad range of industries in africa. whether it's advertising, logistics as a service or payment services in the future, we have a compelling suite of assets and services to support the growth of businesses in africa and their transition to the digital economy. and building these services into sustainable monetization streams provides us with the flexibility and firepower to further into the growth of our consumer-facing activities.
moving on to costs on page 19. over the past two years, we have transformed our unique economic and the economics of fulfillment in particular. gross profit after fulfillment expense reached usd 7.7 million, up 16%. this is our seventh consecutive quarter of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense.
fulfillment expense remained stable in q2 '21 versus q2 '20, despite an acceleration in orders as the increase in freight and shipping costs was offset by staff cost savings and increased efficiency in our fulfillment centers. in addition, we are able to pass on an increasing proportion of our fulfillment expense to the combination of consumers and sellers via our fulfillment and value-added services revenue streams, respectively. the pass-through of our fulfillment expense measured as the ratio of the sum of fulfillment and value-added services revenue over fulfillment expense, increased from 73% in q2 '20 to 75% in q2 '21. this ratio may fluctuate in the near term as we intend to use targeted shipping subsidies to support usage growth.
moving on to sales and advertising costs, page 20. we are also increasing our sales and advertising investments to support usage growth. sales and advertising expense reached usd 17 million in q2 '21, more than double the spend in q2 '20. however, it is largely in line with the amount spent in q2 '20 as we return to more historical levels of marketing investment after a period of significant reduction over the prior six quarters.
and this marketing investment are deployed across all relevant customer acquisition and retention channels, as outlined by jeremy earlier. turning to technology and g&a expense, page 22. technology is another area of increased investment, with technology and content expense reaching usd 8.4 million, up 8%. general and administrative expense, excluding sbc reached usd 26.6 million, down 15%.
the trend was mostly attributable to a decrease in provisions, particularly as the second quarter of 2020 included usd 5 million of provision for class action settlement. moving on to adjusted ebitda loss, page 22. we have clear objectives of usage growth acceleration and jumiapay development, and our capital allocation reflects that. adjusted ebitda loss increased by 15% as our increase in gross investments, sales and advertising and technology expenses was larger than the expansion of gross profit after fulfillment expense and the savings generated in g&a expense, excluding sbc.
let's now turn to balance sheet and cash flow. we are increasing our growth investment in an asset-light manner, leveraging specific benefits of our operating model. capex in q2 '21 was usd 1.5 million as we operate jumia logistics as a platform with very limited capex requirements. net change in working capital resulted in an inflow of usd 12.6 million in q2 '21.
that was mainly attributable to an increase in payables associated with the jumia anniversary campaign, which took place in june '21. cash utilization for the quarter, defined as cash used in operations and investing activities, was usd 27.4 million in q2 '21. that is significantly lower than the adjusted ebitda loss of usd 42 million thanks to the working capital inflow during the quarter. the cash and cash equivalent position at the end of june '21 was usd 637.7 million.
this stronger balance sheet position gives us the firepower to increase in a disciplined manner our investments in usage acceleration and jumiapay development. with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, antoine. thank you very much. in summary, q2 was a transition quarter where we ramped up our sales and advertising expense after six quarters of reduced marketing spend. we started to see some early positive signs, and we are confident about the impact of those investments on usage growth acceleration.
as we have highlighted, the past six years have been transformational, for jumia and have set strong foundations for us to accelerate the execution on our priorities. we're very excited by the new phase we are entering. we see a vast and untapped market opportunity, both on the e-commerce and fintech fronts, and we believe that we are uniquely equipped to capitalize on this opportunity. the objectives for us going forward are very clear, accelerate usage growth, development of jumiapay.
we're deploying more capital, particularly in marketing and technology to achieve these objectives. and as we mentioned also during the last call, the acceleration will not happen overnight. we accept -- we expect it to be gradual. we have already seen some early signs of success in q2 with accelerating orders, growth, pocket a very strong momentum, whether it's food delivery or the jumiapay app services.
and we plan to continue sharing with you milestones of success as we execute on our strategy. many of the investments we are making now, and that jeremy told you more about earlier, are long term in nature. and we will take no shortcut in pursuit of quick wins. we are committed to building a successful business and a thriving ecosystem for our consumers and partners for decades to come.
and, of course, while we are currently very focused on growth acceleration, reaching breakeven remain very much on the agenda. our capital allocation and approach to cost will continue to be disciplined. we may see some fluctuation in the economics in the near term as we ramp up investments, but we ultimately expect usage growth and the diversification of our monetization streams to support our path to profitability. thank you very much for your attention.
and operator, we are now ready to take questions.

ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] you first question for today is coming from aaron kessler. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. i'm aaron kessler, raymond james. just quickly, if you can discuss maybe the covid impact you're seeing in the quarter, maybe into q3 as well.
obviously, still top of mind for a lot of investors. and then second, just on the marketing side. what are some of the key measures that we should be watching to analyze the success there? is it more focused on user growth near term, gmv? and just kind of what are the key metrics you're going to be looking at to analyze the success? and should we start to expect the benefit in q3? or is this more of a multiyear quarter or a multiyear journey on the marketing side? thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks very much, aaron, for the questions. i think on the covid impact, as you all know and as you know, we've been commenting quite a lot on that. perhaps it's been more of a disruption than a tailwind. and this has been largely because in africa, we've not seen lockdowns the same way we have seen in, for example, europe or the u.s.
and people could still shop, they could still go to stores normally during the day. and what we have seen on the contrary is a lot of restrictions of movement, things like curfew, preventing our delivery partners from doing deliveries at night, preventing restaurants from opening at night and even for delivery. and so, it's been a lot of that. and there are still some of that happening here and there, right? so in the last few weeks, a few big cities have announced curfews at 8 pm, for example, limiting our ability to do night deliveries and, of course, limiting the restaurants from doing food delivery at home.
so look, we still see some of that, but i would call those rather minor. and we believe that we are operating more normally right now, right, as we have been over the last few months. so no particular change in the last few weeks, some rather minor here and there. but again, keep in mind that for us, it's been overall more of a disruption on a net basis than a tailwind.
when it comes to marketing, it's a very good question. and of course, as you start to see, there's obviously some lag between the investments that we're doing in sales and advertising and some of the benefits that we are seeing in terms of usage acceleration. and over time, what we want to see, obviously, is an acceleration of the three usage metrics that we see, which are the gmv, the orders and the active consumers, right? given our focus and given our priorities, clearly, the orders is the metric that tends to grow the fastest because we are focused on driving the everyday categories, and they're engaging with the consumer. so we think that this metric of orders will be the one to watch a bit more than the others.
but again, over time, we want to grow the various usage metrics. and the kpis that we want to look at over time are, of course, the ratio of the growth acceleration, i would say, year over year, of those three metrics, as well as the efficiency of the marketing, both over gmv, over the number of orders, as well as the proactive consumer on an annual basis, right? and when can we see those benefits? i think they will be gradual. so again, we start to see some of them in q2, and we are very confident that we will see more and more of them gradually in the next few quarters.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you, sacha.
operator
your next question is coming from sarah simon. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yeah, hi. sarah from berenberg. i have got two questions, please. first one was, as you ramped up marketing investment, can you give us a bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of the evolution of customer acquisition costs? and the second one is if we look at slide seven, and that's obviously becoming quite familiar in terms of the shift away from phones and electronics.
so you've talked about fmcg build-out. i'm assuming that fmcg is growing faster than overall. fashion, you said is the biggest -- is growing faster than fmcg because that would be physical goods. and food and delivery is up from 9% to 14%.
so i'm just wondering what's the category which is not within the blue section, which isn't growing or is maybe shrinking? if you can just give us a bit more color there? thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, of course. thanks, sarah. on the customer acquisition cost, it's a tricky question because it's tricky for us. but it's tricky because right now, we're doing a lot of investments on consumer education and on above the line, as we call them, and off-line activities like billboards and youtube videos and so on and so forth.
and one has to be careful when you decide to make some allocation about how much goes to new consumers versus how much goes through returning consumers, right? and so depending on those assumptions, you can really have very different view of how the customer acquisition cost is looking. so this is why we like to look at the efficiency of our marketing dollars over a period of four quarters. looking at the ltm, last 12-month active consumers and the marketing that we invest in order to engage those consumers. but i think with time, we'll see this metric continue to trend in the right direction.
at the same time, given how much we have reduced marketing investment over the last few quarters, and over the last six quarters, we've reduced and reduced. and now, we have brought the sales and advertising back to the level of 2019. i think we'll deviate from the last 12 months efficiency, right? so we'll have to see how the next few quarters shape up, but i think that the efficiency will not be as good as the last 12 months, obviously, because they were quite unique. but over time, over a longer period of time, multiple years, i think it will keep trending in the right direction and become more efficient with time as consumers get comfortable with the online transactions and with e-commerce in general.
now, on slide seven, it's hard to just tell you here. i think it's -- overall, the trend is that fashion, beauty and fmcg are doing well. i think fashion is doing well. i think last year in q2 maybe, we were having a lot of masks and covid-related items for the first time.
so maybe that is changing here. but there's not one big trend or one big category that i could name that is not doing well. i think it's more a generic trend. perhaps there is some of that from last year, specifically q2 because it's when it started to happen and changed a bit the mix because of that.
but that's the only thing that can come to mind right now. there's not something that is major out there.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. and then within digital, i think last quarter, you highlighted that you actually scaled back some of the digital payments like -- which weren't particularly profitable for you. but in this presentation, you've highlighted digital services as a growth category. so have you changed that kind of philosophy? because i think with stuff like mobile phone recharge and things you scaled back on in q1, but have you switched that more back on in q2?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
no, not specifically. i think the trend is continuing, that those categories are still there and still very important for us. but we tend to see them and to make decisions based on customer lifetime value with those categories, right? so no, that trend continues, and we've not done a lot more of those in q2. the trend that we talked about in q1 continues.
and i think it's a good trend because it means that we have more users on the jumiapay app doing more than just their time, right? and we see lots of momentum on categories like gaming and financial services, micro loans and so on. so i think it's very good. and we hope that this will continue.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. sorry, final follow-up on that would be, i mean, given that some of the digital services, you are emphasizing less as you said. if we think about growth in food delivery separately from digital services, do you think the growth has been -- has the growth been higher than from the 9% to 14% would imply, if that makes sense? so if digital services maybe stay flat, i mean, did digital services grow in the sense of gmv given the pluses and the minuses you talked about?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
and so, on the -- because on the digital services, you have more usage on those services that i mentioned and probably a bit less usage on airtime. i think on food delivery, the quarter last year, which was quite strongly impacted by the disruption, right? so i think we had shown this graph last year where we had shown food delivery going down quite significantly starting in may or something like that. and this year, of course, we've seen less of those disruptions. so some of the food delivery has gone faster on the -- in this quarter because, of course, of some of the disruptions from the previous quarter, if that makes sense, sarah.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yeah. yeah. cool. thanks very much.

your next question is coming from lamont williams. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. lamont williams with stifel. so just a quick question. when we look at marketing expense for the balance of the year, is this level that we saw this quarter kind of the run rate we can expect from investment going for the balance of the year, or should we see this ramp even more?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
we would hope to be able to ramp up gradually from this level. of course, we -- part of the marketing is investments in the brand. part of it is more performance and conversion driven. so please don't take it as a definitive view, but the intention would be to gradually increase from that level.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and is the -- i'm sorry, go ahead.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
i think you have to look also at this as a two-, three-year perspective, right? and i think you can see that in 2019, we had almost the same level as the level that we just had here, right? and if we think about q3, q4, we have black friday coming and so on. so i think you need to take two per year perspective to appreciate when i say gradual increase. it means from -- both from the level of q2 but also from the level of historical years because q3, q4, of course, you have the ramp up of black friday.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. and just as a follow-up, is there any callouts in terms of just the volume growth by geography?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
no, nothing special. we're still very, very well diversified. nigeria, about 25% of the activity. egypt, about 20%.
and then we've got north africa, west africa, east africa, south africa, nothing outstanding out there. i think it's still valid and -- of course, there are some countries always doing better and some countries a bit less than this and on that. but i think overall, it's a pretty consistent story.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.

i would now like to turn the call over to safae damir, head of investor relations for jumia. please go ahead.

with that, i'll hand over to sacha. 
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, very much. welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. let's start on page three and announced in q2 we are currently focusing on scaling our platform. by scaling our platform, we mean accelerating our usage growth, accelerating the development of jumiapay, diversifying our monetization, and all this in order to drive progress toward profitability.
i think our results in q3 very much reflect that strategy. we are able to enter this new phase of scale with strong confidence because in the past three, four years we have strongly enhanced our fundamentals. jumia is a very different company today versus four years ago, we have increased marketplace relevance, we have enhanced unit economics, strengthened our balance sheet. and ultimately, we've built what we believe to be a very strong and scalable platform, including the marketplace, logistics, payments, all adapted to our markets in africa.
and given the strength of our fundamentals, it's the right strategy now to scale the platform. if you move to page four, you can see that the acceleration is now underway. quarterly orders reached all-time high, record number in q3 2021, posting the fastest year-on-year growth of the past seven quarters. consumers, we've got -- we posted in terms of annual active consumers, the fastest sequential growth of the past five quarters, and we recorded in q3, the highest ever number of quarterly active consumers.
and as a result of the acceleration in consumer and orders, we are reaching an inflection in gmv, which is now growing by 8% year over year. this is great news. acceleration is underway, we see good momentum and, certainly, we are working to drive even more momentum going forward. on page five, you can see that adjusted ebitda reflects the increased investments in the long-term growth of the business.
there are two main areas where we are currently investing. the first is consumer adoption. we are increasing our investments in sales and advertising and in consumer incentives in order to drive increased brand awareness, increased brand consideration, conversion of new consumers, and increased loyalty. we're investing in our brands.
we're investing in our consumers, both for long-term growth, and we do it in a very targeted and disciplined way. the second area is technology and g&a. here, our objective is to accelerate the development of product and features for an even more engaging and seamless user experience, as well as, of course, the development of jumiapay. we are comfortable with the increased level of ebitda loss, given the strength of our unit economics that we just -- that we will comment in a minute; good signs of growth that we have just seen.
and of course, our cash position of $584 million at the end of the quarter. now, let's review on page six, the unit economics, which obviously are a key enabler for these growth investments. on this page, you can see that the average order value now stands at $28 as we continue to shift our mix toward more of the everyday product categories. and in parallel, our gross profit after fulfillment expenses, excluding consumer incentives, which are deducted from revenues stands at $1.3 per order, which represents 4.6% of the value of each order.
two years ago, same numbers were $0.5 and 1.2%. even this, given the strength of the unit economics, we are investing more into scaling the platform, and this includes targeted investments in consumer adoption. you can see on this chart that we have increased consumer incentives to $0.9 per order, which a level which is similar to the ones that we had two years ago. and our sales and advertising per order are now spending at $2.8.
we believe that we have very strong unit economics, and this will continue to allow us to invest into scaling the platform. with this, let me now hand over to jeremy, who will give us more details on the performance of q3.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, sacha. hello, everyone, and thanks for joining today. so we kick off with the review of the usage trend during the quarter on page eight. so on page eight, i mean, our growth acceleration strategy is clearly starting to pay off.
the orders reached an all-time high of $8.5 million, surpassing the prior q4 peaks and increasing by 28% year over year, which is the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters. the annual active consumers reached 7.3 million, which is at 8% year over year, supported by a strong acceleration in new consumer adds during the quarter. we are also seeing a sequential step up in annual active consumers at 4% quarter over quarter, which is the fastest sequential growth of the past five quarters. as a result of the acceleration in consumer and orders growth, we are reaching an inflection point in the gmv trajectory, which increased by 8% year over year, reaching $238 million.
this is positive momentum, and we believe we can maintain this momentum as we continue to focus on the two categories, and as we continue to invest in growth. on page nine, you can see that we continue to shift the mix toward everyday product category, which went from 44% of the gmv in 2019 to 64% in q3 this year. the average order value now stands at $28. if we look now on page 10, at the trends by product category with more details.
we see that the gmv growth momentum across all categories with the only exception of phones and electronics, which continue to be affected by supply chain disruption. in q3, the fastest-growing category in gmv terms was jumiapay, digital, and financial services, with almost double year over year. fmcg was the second fastest-growing category in gmv terms. it was also the fastest growing category in terms of items sold, posting its highest ever volume number and almost doubling year over year.
we see great momentum in the grocery subcategory, which we keep improving to serve the daily needs of our consumers. food delivery maintained its strong momentum and was the second fastest-growing category in terms of items sold, growing by almost 40% year over year. food delivery posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders. we are pleased to see broad-based momentum across everyday product category, and we are confident that our continued investment and disciplined execution will further fuel the acceleration.
we are moving now to jumiapay on page 12, sorry. jumiapay tpv increased by 15% from $56 million in q3 last year to $64.5 million in q3 this year, supported by the growth in gmv and jumiapay app digital services in particular. on platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of the gmv, reached a new high of 27.1% in q3 this year, up from 25.4% q3 last year. if we turn to transactions on page 13, jumiapay transactions reached $3 million in q3 this year, up 34% year over year, the fastest transaction growth rate of the past five quarters.
jumiapay transactions growth was supported by accelerating volume growth across the business in the food delivery category in particular. overall, 35.7% of orders placed on the jumia platform in q3 this year were completed using jumiapay compared to 34.1% last year. in parallel, with increasing the penetration of jumiapay platform in a gradual and disciplined manner. we have initiated the first steps of jumiapay of platform.
these were initiated in egypt earlier this month, where we are starting to process our first payment of platform for third-party online merchants. i'd like to take this opportunity actually to explain in more detail our strategy on jumiapay, and i'm now on page 14. as explained in the past, our strategy with jumiapay is to offer the two-sided fintech ecosystem for consumers and merchants. the first and essential layer of this ecosystem is payments.
for consumers, we have built a jumiapay checkout account that can be linked to their payment method of choice. it can be linked to a debit or credit card, bank account or a wallet. there's a huge variety of payment methods in africa, and we have built jumiapay checkout accounts to embrace and accommodate the diversity. in the future, we intend to turn the jumiapay checkout accounts into a full-fledged wallet with an extended range functionality, including cash-in, cash-out features to be transactions and many more.
for merchants, we have built a jumiapay branded checkout solution that can leverage the existing days of jumiapay checkout account holders. and that is the solution we are currently rolling out to third-party online merchants in egypt. on top of the payment solutions, we are overlaying an extensive range of financial solutions for both consumers and merchants. for consumers, we have a number of these solutions already live in the jumiapay app offered by third-party service providers, which as micro loans, the savings products, insurance policies, etc.
while these products are live in selected countries, they remain in the early stage of their development, and we intend to further expand and diversify the product offering. for merchants, we are also developing a range of relevant financial services, starting with credit products. today, we collect jumia sellers with third-party financial institutions, helping them access credit by leveraging their business data in an anonymized basis for credit rate purposes. in q3, almost 500 loans were disbursed, more than doubling versus last year and benefiting over 350-unit seller, a 55% increase year over year.
access to credit and financial inclusion is a meaningful point for sme sellers, whether on or off the jumia platform, and we intend to further develop this activity to serve a growing base of merchants. in addition to payment and financial services, we are developing an extensive range of digital services for consumers and merchants. for consumers, we are already offering a broad range of services on the jumiapay app, and we're constantly expanding it. to give you a sense, we now have more than 300 services available, ranging from paying your university bills to booking your bus tickets.
for merchants, we offer user-friendly features to track transactions, balances and settlements. and they also have access to marketing and loyalty tools to allow them to deliver promotions to specific customer cohorts. jumiapay is a core part of our strategy. we are very excited about the recent development and what's coming ahead, as we have all the relevant building blocks to grow jumiapay into a payment and fintech solution in africa.
now, i hand over to safae, who is covering for antoine today, that will walk you through our financial performance in more detail.
safae damir -- head of investor relations
thank you, jeremy. i will start with our monetization metrics. let's look at the strength of our marketplace revenue on page 16. marketing and advertising revenue increased by 14%, supported by robust seller take-up of our ad solutions.
we have doubled the number of monthly seller ad campaigns in q3 '21 compared to the monthly average of the first half of the year. this was partly offset by generally tighter budget from third-party advertisers and agencies in particular. value-added services revenue increased by 11% year over year. this was a result of increased volumes in our platform and hence higher shipping contributions collected from sellers, as well as increased take-up by sellers of our warehousing services.
commissions and fulfillment revenue are both impacted by consumer incentives. excluding this impact, commissions' revenue was up 18%, driven by usage growth and fulfillment revenue was down 2% as we chose to reduce the shipping back to customers. one of the key features of our revenue model is the diversity of our monetization stream. and this gives us the flexibility to adjust the monetization intensity to serve our strategy.
part of the monetization strategy is also to drive revenue and margin of our platform assets, jumia logistics and jumiapay. i now would like to give you an update on jumia logistics page 17. we are seeing strong momentum in this business, and we reached a new milestone in q3 '21 with revenue generated from these activities, reaching the $1 million mark. this was driven by a record volume of 2.9 million packages shipped, more than doubling quarter on quarter on behalf of over 700 clients.
our clients span a very broad range of sectors, and we have laid out on the page a few examples of logistics-as-a-service clients we worked with during the quarter. in kenya, we collaborated with galana oil, a leading oil marketing company to expand their logistics capacity and service sales outlets and third-party clients across the country. in ivory coast, we worked with platinum, the sole distributor for kellogg's, to serve wholesale and modern trade clients across the country. in tunisia, we worked with kamioun, a leading fmcg distributor, to serve their retailers across greater tunis area.
we are very pleased with this momentum and milestone. we believe we have created a very unique logistics platform relevant -- very relevant to large and small companies across many sectors. moving on to gross profit trajectory on page 18. gross profit before the impact of consumer incentives showed a steady increase over the past two years, accelerating by 14% year over year in q3 '21.
similarly, the margin as percentage of gmv increased to 14% in q3 '21 from 13% in q3 '20, which was a 478-basis point step-up versus q3 '19. we made the decision to reinvest some of these monetization gains into our price competitiveness, increasing consumer incentives to $7.5 million in q3 '21 to $2 million in q3 '20. i would point out here that the q3 '20 levels were very modest and were down 63% compared to q3 '19. as a result, gross profit, which is net of consumer incentives, decreased by 6% from $27.1 million in q3 '20 to $25.5 million in q3 '21, which is 21% higher than q3 '19.
similarly, gross profit as a percentage of gmv decreased from 12% in q3 '20 to 11% in q3 '21, remaining 346 basis points above the margin level of q3 '19. moving on to costs on page 20. while we are in a phase of expansion and increased investments, we are maintaining strong cost discipline. and you can see that we continue generating logistics efficiency on a volume unit basis.
fulfillment expense increased by 13% year over year, while orders accelerated by 28% over the same period. and while our orders in q3 '21 were 22% higher than in q3 '19, our fulfillment expense in q3 '21 was 5% lower than in q3 '19, which speaks to the significant step-up in logistics efficiency. moving on to sales and advertising costs, page 21. sales and advertising expense reached $24 million in q3 '21, up 228% year over year and up 57% compared to q3 '19.
we picked up the pace of marketing investments in june '21 and maintained a similar level of largely marketing investments throughout q3 '21 on the back of 18 months of reduced marketing expense. the increase in marketing investments was implemented across marketing channels, with 60% of the increase allocated to online performance marketing across the full consumer journey funnel. the remaining 40% was allocated to off-line media and video advertising, which were largely curtailed in 2020. and you can see that the split of our sales and advertising expense in q3 '21 is largely in line with better q3 '19, albeit with a slight reduction in the share of backlog.
i now would like to give you a bit more color on the nature of our marketing investments and activities with a few illustrations from q3 '21 on page 22. we consider consumer incentives as marketing investments. and that's because price and shipping adjustments are key to support consumer acquisition and loyalty. in q3 '21, we deployed our newly launched ai-powered crm growth tool across geographies.
this tool allows us to retarget specific customer cohorts with tailored incentives based on their purchase history and user signals. above the line marketing, i.e., radio, tv and out-of-home advertising was very limited in 2020 and at the beginning of 2021. we are now ramping up investments in this channel with dedicated brand building and awareness campaign. our out-of-home campaigns are aimed at increasing our awareness and reach in strategic geographical areas which are still underpenetrated.
below-the-line and online performance marketing continues to account for the largest share of our marketing investments. as we increase our investments in online marketing channel, we constantly seek to optimize the efficiency of these investments. in facebook marketing, for example, we have moved to a full-funnel approach. this consists of going beyond the bottom of the funnel direct response ads, into brand awareness campaigns to broaden our audience reach and drive new user adoption.
to increase the efficiency of our investments, our data science teams are working very closely with facebook to enhance campaign structure and brand awareness kpis, including ad recall uplift, app installs and content views. on social media, we are building a leading network in africa of key opinion leaders, or kols. in september alone, our network counted over 260 active kols across africa. in q3 '21, we rolled out a proprietary kols management platform that allows us to acquire, manage and compensate kols in a fully automated manner.
turning to technology and g&a expenses on page 23. technology is another area of increased investments with technology and content expense, reaching $9.4 million, up 27% year over year and 21% compared to q3 '19. tech is the backbone of our platform, and we are increasing investments in this area to build more products and features to enhance user experience and engagement on our platform. general and administrative expense, excluding sbc, reached $25.2 million, up 10% year over year.
this was mostly due to an uptick in staff costs as we strengthened the management bench in selected areas of the business to support growth. the g&a costs, excluding sbc, in q3 '21 remained 11% lower compared to the levels in q3 '19 as we maintain cost discipline in this area. moving to adjusted ebitda loss on page 24. we have clear objectives of usage growth acceleration and jumiapay development, and our capital allocation reflects that.
adjusted ebitda loss reached $52.5 million in q3 '21 compared to $27 million in q3 '20 as a result of increased growth investments in the form of consumer incentives, sales and advertising and technology investments. let's now turn to balance sheet and cash flow items, page 25. we are increasing our growth investments in an asset-light manner, leveraging specific benefits of our operating model. capex in q3 '21 was $0.8 million as we operate jumia logistics as a platform with very limited capex requirements.
net change in working capital recorded resulted in an inflow of $7.1 million in q3 '21. this was mainly a result of an increase in payables relating to the uptick in third-party activity, as well as a shorter receivables cycle. cash utilization for the quarter, defined as cash used in operating and investing activities, excluding investments in financial assets, was $47.6 million in q3 '21, supported by the working capital inflow during the quarter. at the end of september '21, we had a liquidity position of $584 million, comprised of $185 million of cash and cash equivalents and $399 million of financial assets.
with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, guys. thank you, safae. thank you very much, jeremy. i think in q3, you can see that it marks the beginning of our order phase of scaling the platform.
and by scaling the platform, we mean, again, accelerating usage growth, developing jumiapay, diversifying monetization, all this to drive the faster profitability, and we're leveraging, of course, the strong fundamentals and the strong unit economics and efficiency gains that we have achieved over the past two years. i think if we look at our results, we -- on growth, we've got record order number, plus 28% year over year. we've got record quarterly active consumers; we've got gmv growing. so we're pleased with that.
i think on developing jumiapay, we see good growth, 15% growth of volume or value, sorry, 34% of volume. also, the first transactions of platforms in egypt. so very, very pleased with that on diversifying monetization, we see that efforts on jumia logistics are starting to be meaningful, and we reached the $1 billion mark. so i think the strategy is well underway, and we have put more capital to work during the quarter.
with good signs, i would say, of usage acceleration of jumiapay and of diversifying the monetization. we have this vast, untapped market opportunity, both on the e-commerce and payment fronts. and in this context, we really want to establish jumia as the go through destination for consumers, and we want to develop jumiapay to a payment and fintech champion on the continents. over the next few quarters, building upon this momentum, we intend to continue, further accelerate the pace of usage growth, accelerating orders, consumers, driving further gmv inflection.
and to fuel this growth, we will continue stepping up our consumer adoption and technology investments. in the near term, of course, we may see some fluctuation in unit economics as we ramp up investments, but we ultimately expect that the usage growth and the diversification of our monetization streams will support them. we are very confident that achieving scale for growth acceleration, jumiapay development and monetization will ultimately take the business to breakeven, and we do this, of course, maintaining a disciplined approach to cost and through capital allocation. thank you very much for your attention, and we are now ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions]. your first question is coming from aaron kessler with raymond james. please pose your question.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. a couple of questions. first is on the increased level of marketing.
can you talk a little bit about quality of the customers you're getting? i guess, there's always concerned with some of the incentives that maybe these are more short-lived customers. and then, kind of may how long are you planning kind of with this increased level of marketing spend? do you expect this to kind of analyze some of the data after this? or do you think this will sustain for several quarters, maybe until you can kind of get that unit economics to drive overall profitability? thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you very much, aaron. a lot to impact here. i think on the strategy in terms of marketing, we're definitely investing across the full spectrum of the consumer journey, right? we're investing at the very top of the funnel and brand awareness, education. we're investing into consideration.
we're investing into conversion. we're investing into loyalty. so very much across the spectrum because, as we know that we have a large number of consumers who are yet to start transacting online. and so, we are really investing across the whole spectrum.
and certainly, we have a view to optimize the consumer lifetime value, right? and the consumer incentives are part of that. and the share of the consumer incentive over the total marketing dollars that we invest, we think is reasonable, and certainly, we invest all consumer incentives with a consumer lifetime value in mind. and i agree with you that there will always be deal seekers and quality of customers who may not be as good as others, but over time, we are optimizing based on clv. and our ultimate goal is to have very loyal customers who are repeat customers and consumer incentives, i think, are a good way to drive conversion or sometimes to drive certain behaviors.
and for example, to help consumers discover new category or as we have done in the past to help them overcome the jumiapay, for example, we give discounts for consumers to transact on jumiapay. so we see the consumer incentive is very strategic and as part of driving the right consumer lifetime value and not necessarily as tactical. now, in terms of level, certainly, we want to continue to invest and to continue to invest more. i think what we want to see is increased efficiency with time, right? so, certainly, the question will be about how fast we can improve the efficiency of those marketing investments.
obviously, based on what i said, a lot of those marketing investments are for the long term, right, brand awareness, consideration, and we want to see the marketing efficiency improve over time. and as we see that we will be very comfortable continuing to increase the absolute dollars that we are investing in marketing, right, if that makes sense. so we'll have to navigate based on how the efficiency is evolving and as the efficiency evolves, we will allocate more dollars, right? so i think it's an equation here that we are solving for, and that over time, what i can say is that we want to increase the absolute dollars that we invest, and we want to see also the efficiency increasing, right? again, over time, it may not be the case exactly one quarter to the other, but over time, we want to do those two things.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
and a quick follow-up for the incentives. can you just say where you're recognizing those? is that contra revenues, cogs, sales and marketing? and then, for the -- it looks like we saw a decline in third-party revenues, but an increase in first-party revenues. i assume that was kind of an intentional shift made more fast-moving goods in the quarter.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. so they are accounted for as a minus of revenues and mainly minus in the buckets of commissions and in the buckets of shipping, right? so that's where they are accounted for as a minus of that, and this is why we are presenting here in this presentation a few aggregates before and after consumer incentives. so that comparison can be made within the quarters from last year and the year before. and yes, what was your second question, aaron, sorry?
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. i think it was related to that. so if you add that, then you would have grown third-party revenues in aggregate?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, exactly. because that's why we presented on this stage, the commissions before and after consumer incentives. and you can see that without the consumer incentives, the commission are growing by 18% after they are declining by 21%, right? so we consider those to be as part of our effort to drive consumer education, consumer adoption. and so, that's why we present both charts.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
of course.

your next question is coming from lamont williams at stifel. please pose your question.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. you talked a little bit in the letter about doing more 1p in the grocery category. is this more just to get more skus in the category? how are you thinking about a long time with the 1p portion in the category? is this something you'll need to do? or will you kind of shift back to a more marketplace sku?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
it's a good question. i think we're doing this on grocery especially because of the complexity for the big brands and the big suppliers to operate the marketplace business that they're not really used to, right? and the biggest fmcg player is in our markets, they don't operate the b2c business, right? they don't do drop shipping and they don't -- they're not geared for that, right? what they want is to sell to distributors who are then distributing to consumers and recognizing this -- recognizing also that we have the knowledge and the capabilities to operate the 1p business, because we've always operated 1p business. we have the systems, the processes, the capabilities, the standard procedures to operate 1p. we're deciding right now that we want to operate a large part of the grocery on 1p and that's a great -- i would say that's a great strength and that's a great advantage because we are able to accelerate even faster and adapting to the operating models that the big plans and the big distributors are used to.
and for us, as always, we see 1p as something that we do, and we know how to do it. so it's not really a problem. i don't know if in the future this will move to marketplace or no. we'll see.
maybe it will, maybe it will not. at the end of the day, we think that's generally neutral on a gross profit basis, because the margin that we make on the 1p corresponds or would correspond more or less to the commission that we would take into the type of revenue that we would make on a marketplace basis. so i think financially, this is something that we are prepared to do, and that really makes sense for us to drive the growth of the category.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and just a separate question. with holidays coming up, it looks like the promotional environment has gotten -- has moved a little earlier. could you just talk about how you're thinking about holiday and maybe some of the trends you're seeing post quarter, if you can?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
well, i'm not sure i get the first part of the question, among -- like on the promotions and the incentives for us. again, is really something that we are driving in a strategic way? so, again, i think the example of the occurring a discount for consumers to pay with jumiapay, right, or for example, doing free shipping on certain size of baskets for grocery items, right? so we're using those incentives to drive consumers toward the categories of product and toward the type of payment methods that we think really makes sense. it's really the objective of that. and that's, for us, completely part of the consumer adoption and the clv customer lifetime value strategy, and it's very integrated into everything that we do into our plan and strategically.
and then, of course, our intention, i think we're pleased with the usage that we are seeing in the recent acceleration, but our intention is certainly to continue that, right? and we want to scale the platform and accelerate the growth, right? so that's certainly the intention, and that's certainly something that we hope to see in q4 and then the quarters to come, right? so again, good numbers, but we don't want to stop here, and the intention is to grow faster than this.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you.

your next question is coming from josh koren with musketeer capital. please pose your question.
josh koren -- musketeer capital -- analyst
hi. thank you so much, and congrats to everybody on the inflection quarter and the acceleration of growth. my question is two-fold. first of all, maybe you can give us some color on how the end of the quarter kind of trended relative to the beginning of the quarter? so knowing that you started to spend in sales and marketing toward the end of q2, did the growth rate continue to kind of pick up through q3? and any kind of color that you can give us on an exit growth rate for gmv in q3, or some kind of expectation for what we can roughly expect in terms of the further acceleration for q4, would be really helpful.
thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. of course, josh. thanks for asking the question. i think maybe i will just go back to what i just said, right, which is like at the end of the day, we are engaging that phase where it's about scaling the platform, which is accelerating usage growth, jumiapay and diversification of monetization, and we're not going to stop where we are now.
and the intention is to accelerate even further, and we're very confident that this will happen.
josh koren -- musketeer capital -- analyst
awesome. and were you seeing that acceleration continue to kind of pick up as we left the third quarter and now as we move into the fourth quarter as the acceleration growth rate increasing now?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
well, it's not something that we will disclose, because i think there can always be some year-on-year effect in august and september and so and so forth. but i think we'll have to see how q4 is playing out. but again, we're very confident about accelerating the acceleration.
josh koren -- musketeer capital -- analyst
no. i love to hear it. and one more question. maybe if we could just dive into a bit further kind of your barrier to entry in africa and your position relative to anybody else that could be in e-commerce and africa? i mean, it seems like you have a leading market position.
how do we all kind of understand how that barrier to entry kind of really stands and what the competitive landscape in africa is and how dominant jumia really is in that landscape?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
i think to start in with the barriers to entry and what it takes to be successful in those markets and stepping back a bit on what does it take for e-commerce to be able to operate at scale and providing great customer experience in africa, there's definitely a number of components behind that, which are extremely hard to create and therefore, to replicate, right? so if you think about the brands that is needed in a market where consumers have never or almost never transacted online. the amount of brand equity that you need to create to build the trust for users to transact for the first time online is something that takes a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of efforts and a lot of localization. so i think the strength of the jumia brand is very big. and sometimes, some investors, they're looking at the app ratings and app ranking, and you always see jumia as one of the biggest downloads on the apps everywhere.
and that is something that takes years and a little of effort to drive. i think, obviously, the supply, right, to be able to bring the right products to the consumers and to work with brands, local sellers, international sellers, local brands, international brands, takes a great deal of time, takes a great deal of investment, to build the right marketplace platform to be able to write 1p capabilities and to be able to do that at scale, right? we have a 100,000 selling around jumia from the biggest distributors and the biggest brands from -- we have cross-border program for international sellers to sell in africa, and we work also with small sellers who are very relevant because they have very local assortment, and they are very agile. and all this is ability to bring the marketplace and the 1p together and the small sellers, and the big sellers, and the brand and the non-branded, and the local and international is what at the end of the day gives the relevance for the consumers. and of course, they're relevant in terms of choice but also, they're relevant in terms of price because those sellers are competing.
so, the second aspect, obviously, is supply. the third and obvious one is the logistics, which is not easy in africa to create a logistic platform that can ship packages across all the areas of the country. and as fast as one hour, or even 20 minutes, in the case of jumia food. and that is something that we have created over the last years, which is obviously a huge asset.
you can see in our fulfillment expense they keep going down. it's a new efficient system and it's not just me saying. now, we have third-party sellers who are coming to use it and we crossed $1 million of revenue from third-party merchants who are choosing jumia logistics. they are choosing it over other players to do logistic services, right? so that's a great testimony of the efficiency as well, and, i think, a lot more to come.
and maybe last but not least. but, of course, payment, being able to operate cash on delivery because we are still in very cash-oriented countries, cash-orientated economy and complementing that with jumiapay is obviously very difficult to reproduce for players who are not necessarily savvy with that. and i think doing this at scale in multiple countries is something that i think takes a lot of passion, a lot of skills, time, energy, and money to do and create, and that's what we have done, so i think it puts us in a pretty good position.
josh koren -- musketeer capital -- analyst
and i would agree. and i guess, though, we're confident with the accelerating momentum here. gmv growth is something they can continue into 2022. is that right?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
right.
josh koren -- musketeer capital -- analyst
ok. excellent. great to hear. thank you so much for taking the time.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you. of course.
operator
[operator instructions]. we do have one additional question from sarah with berenberg. please pose your question.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for taking my question. i thought, i'd already pressed the button. but anyway, i got two actually.
could you just remind us of what product scale into digital orders? and i seem to recall that a couple of quarters ago, you're back on that. so can you just talk a bit about what's changed there? and then, on the shift to grocery 1p, i was on a call with another company doing 1p grocery earlier this morning and they're obviously incurring significant upfront costs in terms of establishing dark stores and stuff, which i assume is what you will have to do as well. so can you just talk about how we should think about factoring the shift to grocery 1p into our forecast? thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, sarah. very good questions. what goes into digital orders and financial services is pretty much everything that is happening on the apps, which is called jumiapay, and that users use to process a number of digital payments and access financial services and so on, so forth. so, it's pretty clear from that perspective that those are all those services that are recorded as digital orders.
and i think a few quarters ago, one of the actions that we took was to start kind of moving a little bit away from the micro transactions from those digital orders, right. so those micro transactions, what we mean by that is the recharge of airtime, for example, and which is a classic one. and a classic strategy with those services is to attract, for example, the consumers with a discount or with a cash back on buying some airtime for a very small amount. and then, targeting that consumer and making sure that the consumers over time develop into a consumer that uses the app for other things, right.
so i think those -- the micro transaction is a traditional way, i would say, to attract consumers, and i would say back in the days we had less services than we have today, right. so today, we have literally hundreds of different services. consumers can book at bus tickets, for example, on the app, they can buy movie theater tickets, they can pay their university fees, they can pay -- you can pay your fines, for example, if you have a fine, parking fine, for example, in some countries, you can pay them on the app and so and so forth, right? so as we have a lot more services, we have less need to attract or to recruit users with those micro transaction. so i think that's what changed, right? we added a lot more services.
and as a result, we are able to do less of those micro transaction, which are not unattractive. they are good and they're attractive and they drive usage to be clear. it's very -- even the best consumers who are doing, all of the other services that i do, we also want them to use jumiapay to recharge their airtime. so there's nothing against those transactions, but we did less of that, right? so that's something that changed.
i think you're referring to that. the 1p grocery is interesting, because we see a lot of food delivery focused players moving into that. and for us, when you think about dark stores for an example, we mentioned that dark store is a small warehouse and to operate the dark store, you need to be able to operate a small warehouse, which means that you need to have the capabilities to do that, you need to have the capabilities to do storage, pick and pack, and inventory management, and logistics, right. and logistics in the sense that warehouse logistics, which is something that we have been doing forever since day one, right.
since when we started jumia, the first thing we did pretty much was to rent a warehouse. and start doing that for jumia express and so on. so, for us, dark store is nothing else than a small warehouse, and we have already dozens of warehouses. so for us, it's an extension of what we already do.
and, of course, there may be some investments here and some investments there. they will go into our g&a probably and maybe you see already some of that, but it's not something that we have not done before. and that's something that we foresee will have the big financial impact, and we already have those warehouses existing in pretty much all the big urban areas. and we're going to stop operating those grocery, quick delivery, dark stores type.
maybe there will be dedicated warehouses, maybe we'll do part inside the warehouses that we have. so, for us it's very much a continuity of what we do.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst

please go ahead.
safae damir -- head of investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. with us today are sacha poignonnec and jeremy hodara, co-founders and co-ceos of jumia, as well as antoine maillet-mezeray, cfo.

sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, safae. welcome everyone. and thank you very much for joining us today. before going into the results, i would like to remind you of our current strategy and where we stand right now.
we are currently focused on scaling our platform with a fundamental and unchanged strategic objective of reaching profitability. to get there, we have very clear priorities, accelerate usage growth, gmv consumers orders, increase monetization and cost efficiencies, continue developing jumiapay. and this is the natural next step in the journey we've been on since inception. we have a vast and largely untapped market of almost 600 million consumers across 11 countries.
to capture this opportunity, we've spent the first years of our journey building the solid foundation for our platform across e-commerce, logistics, and payment. and this platform is uniquely tailored to the specifics of our markets. with this foundation in place, we've focused over the past three years on enhancing the fundamentals of our business. we made tremendous progress building everyday product categories, and our platform has never been more diverse and relevant for consumers as part of this daily lives.
we have also strengthened our unit economics and crossed a major milestone of positive gross profit after fulfillment expense. and it has now been the case consistently for the past nine quarters. lastly, we've raised over $517 million in cash over the past two years, giving us a strong balance sheet to finance our strategy. leveraging these strong fundamentals, we turned our focus in 2021 to accelerating usage growth, to scale our business, and take it to profitability.
we are pleased to report very good progress on growth acceleration during q4. and let's please turn to page 4 for the highlights of the quarter. best usage ever, gmv reached all-time high, active consumers reached all-time high, orders reached all-time high. this is very good.
we're now back to growth. the acceleration strategy is paying off, monetization, highest revenue ever, highest gross profit before consumer incentives ever. ebitda loss stood at minus 70 million in q4, mainly driven by strong investments in sales and advertising and consumer incentives. we invested 27 million more into sales and advertising and consumer incentives in last year.
we're comfortable with this level of investment because of the strengths of our unit economies and because we're seeing the dynamics on usage growth acceleration. so overall a good quarter in our view, building the acceleration of usage we all wanted to see and some great progress on monetization. now we still want to see more, of course, and i will give more precise guidance for 2022 at the end of the call. if we review our usage metrics on page 5, please.
quarterly active consumers reached a record of 3.8 million in q4, up 29% year on year driven by all-time high new consumer ads during the quarter. this is a new kpi that we will now provide every quarter so that we give even more granularity on usage performance. and we will still provide the annual active consumers on a yearly basis. and you can see in the presentation later that we reached this year 8 million active consumers, also a record.
orders accelerated by 40%, also reaching an all-time high of 11.3 million. and this acceleration in both consumers and orders is driving what we believe to be in selection in gmv, which was up 20% year over year reaching again all-time high of $300 million. we're very encouraged obviously by this acceleration and view it as strong evidence that our strategy is paying off. we intend to build on this momentum to further scale our platform and continue to accelerate.
in parallel, let's turn to page 6, please. underlying monetization is also reaching new highs. if we look at our monetization metrics before consumer incentives, which are counted as deductions from the revenue lines, we see a clear trend of acceleration with new records achieved in q4. revenue before consumer incentives reached 74 million up 39%, the fastest revenue growth in the past two years.
gross profits before consumer incentives reached $45 million, up 24%. while the margin as a percentage of gmv reached 13.6%. and finally, gross profit after fulfillment expense and still of course, before consumer incentives also reached a new high at 14 million, up 9% year over year, while margin as a percent of gmv here remained at above 4% and 4.3%. we're very pleased to drive both strong usage growth and strong monetization, and this is giving us the flexibility to further invest in the growth of our platform.
on page 7, you can see that we continued leaning into growth investments in q4, which is what we had initiated earlier in 2021. there are two key areas of investments for us. first is consumer adoption, we are increasing our investments in sales and advertising and consumer incentives, and we're doing so in a targeted and disciplined manner. over 57% of the increase in sales and advertising is coming from increased offline marketing costs, which are largely geared toward brand awareness and consideration.
and second area of investment is platform development. technology, and g&a, tech is the backbone of everything we do at jumia. we are accelerating the development of products and features, which are creating a more engaging and seamless user experience, more effective operations with a fully dedicated tech stack for payment and fintech as well. we are comfortable with the increased level of adjusted ebitda loss during this quarter and the pace of investments for a number of reasons.
number one, these investments are coming from a place of strength. our levels of monetization have never been higher and we have the financial firepower to make those investments. secondly, it's the right time for us to be making this investment. there is strong momentum in the business in terms of usage, and we are building on this momentum to drive even more growth.
and three, these investments are of course creating even more strength in the platform, more compelling experience and more compelling value proposition for all participants as well as bigger scale, which ultimately contributes to the path to profitability. now let's go into more details in the performance and jeremy will take it from there.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, sacha. hello everyone. and thanks for joining today. and i start with the review of the usage trends during the quarter on page 9.
on page 9, we have a very clear acceleration in the usage growth in q4. we have posted during the quarter, the fastest sequential growth rate in almost three years across consumers, orders, and gmv. and we have reached all-time high across each one of these metrics in the quarter. we're adding more consumers than ever before and quarterly active consumers reached a new high of 3.8 million, up 29% year over year.
our consumers are also purchasing more often with almost three orders placed on average, by an active consumer in the first quarter. orders reached a record high of 11.3 million at 40%, as a result of both increased consumer adds and increased purchase frequency of existing consumers, driven by the acceleration in both consumers and order growth were reaching what we believe to be a clear inflection in the gmv trajectory, which increased by 20% year over year reaching a record of $330 million during the quarter. there is strong gross momentum in the business, and that's partly a result of the success of our strategy to increase the focus on everyday product categories. on page 10, you can see a fundamental shift in our gmv mix.
in q4 2019, we had half of our gmv coming from phone and electronics. in q4 2021, only 35% of our gmv is coming from phone and electronics, with 65% coming from categories, which are relevant to consumers as part of their everyday lives such as fashion, home, lifestyle, food delivery, fmcg, etc. average order value now stands at $29 as we further penetrate more affordable and smaller ticket size categories. on page 11, the growth trends by product category conveys similar message about the importance of every day categories, the fastest growing categories in both gmv and items sold are categories that are relevant to consumers as part of their everyday lives.
in particular, the food related categories, which are food delivery and fmcg are growing in excess of 50% year over year in both gmv and items sold terms. phone and electronics are showing some early signs of improvements, growing excess of 10% in terms of items sold. also the global supply chain situation for these categories remain volatile with continued pressure on the chipset supply side. i'd like to give you more color on the fmcg category, which more than doubled in volume terms, demonstrating its strong relevance for consumer in our markets.
on page 12, you've heard us talking in the past about our efforts, commercial efforts to build out the assortment on the fmcg side, with a view to cover the full product spectrum of a typical grocery basket in each one of our markets. we also placed particular emphasis and focus on developing our relationships with blue chip fmcg brands, such as p&g, unilever, coca-cola, nestle, mondelez, and many more. in the full year 2021, we added over 815 new brands on our platform. and we're also adapting our operating model to work efficiently with these brands to secure relevant stock at the best price.
this led us to do more business on a first-party basis with almost 40% of gmv in the fmcg category generated on the first-party basis. the fmcg category is starting to account for a meaningful share of the business. 14% of items sold versus 9% a year ago, which we see as a great news because this is a category where the annual purchase frequency is 25% higher versus the other categories on the platform. so development of fmcg is a case study of our ability to identify relevant categories for our consumers and build them out in an agile manner, adapting our operating model for win-win partnership with suppliers and an attractive value proposition for consumers.
we are overall very pleased with the accelerating usage growth on the platform and have clear priorities for 2022 to further build on that momentum. on page 13, we have outlined selected initiatives to drive the usage growth in 2022. the first one is the continued development of what we call jumia everyday, which are the everyday product categories, including fmcg that i have just touched upon on. on the supply front, we intend to further expand our assortment, leveraging both our third-party sellers, as well as our first-party sourcing capabilities.
on the delivery front, we intend to leverage our e-commerce logistics infrastructure for the delivery of planned purchases as early as the next day, while catering also to immediate needs with under one hour delivery via our on-demand platform jumia food. the second lever of usage growth is a rollout of targeted free shipping. at this stage, free shipping is in certain cities for baskets above a minimum size comprised of jumia express items. these items are the one we hold in our warehouse and that are picked and packed by jumia.
the third lever is tech-driven user experience enhancement. we plan to further increase the level of personalization across the platform, improve our sort algorithm and filtering module while increasing our gamification for an even more engaging experience. we expect these three levers to drive usage growth acceleration, support conversion rate, consumer acquisition, and loyalty. with respect to the free shipping specifically, we expect the sales uplift generated by sellers via free shipping to help us drive more revenue from jumia express, which is barely monetized today.
we're confident accelerated usage growth and increased scale will help us further improve marketing efficiency and ultimately contribute to our path to profitability. let's now move on to jumiapay. we're also seeing good momentum here and are constantly enhancing our platform and expanding the range of financial and digital services available to consumers. we're highlighted on page 15, some selected development related to jumiapay in q4 2021.
to support the growth of jumiapay on and off platform, we conducted an upgrade of our risk infrastructure, in addition to our proprietary in-house risk engine, which scans each transaction real-time against over 300 factors. we rolled out a third-party device fingerprinting technology. this tool aggregates over 1,000 data points providing an even more precise basis for fraud detection and prevention. we further expanded the range of consumer finance products available to our consumers as part of the black friday campaign.
we established a partnership with valu in egypt, a leading buy now pay later fintech platform, allowing consumers to pass-through interest-free installments over nine months. we're currently working on expanding the range of tenures for the buy now pay later installments. in addition, we partnered with seven different banks as part the black friday campaign in egypt to offer installments to consumers. on the jumiapay app, we continued adding more relevant everyday services.
in nigeria, we set up an integration with quickteller, the largest building aggregator in nigeria. this partnership allows us to offer over 70 additional billers on the jumiapay app, including government services, internet service provider, airlines, and many more. moving onto the tpv on page [technical difficulty] from $70 million in q4 2020 to $90 million in q4 2021, supported by the growth in gmv and jumiapay app digital services in particular. on platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of the gmv reached a new high 27.4% in q4 this year, up from 25.5% in q4 2020.
turning to transactions on page 17, jumiapay transactions reached 3.9 million in q4 2021, up 46% year over year, the fastest transactions growth rate of the past seven quarters. jumiapay transactions growth was supported by accelerating volume growth across the business and in particular, the food delivery category, which more than doubled year over year. overall, 34.7% of orders placed on the jumia platform in q4 were completed using jumiapay, compared to 33% in q4 last year. we made good progress on jumiapay throughout 2021.
and we intend to build on this momentum to further expand the range of payment and fintech solutions for both merchants and consumer in 2022. on page 18, we have outlined selected initiatives that we are driving to push the development of jumiapay in 2022. the first one is the development of our payment processing activities off-platform. we intend to start offering in 2022, our payment processing solutions off-platform to third-party merchants, starting in egypt, initiating off-platform tpv and payment processing revenue.
2021 marked an important milestone for jumiapay as we obtained in egypt under the sponsorship of national bank of egypt, the relevant licenses to process payments on behalf of third-party off-platform. in 2022, we intend to secure the relevant licenses in selected other market for off-platform payment processes. the second initiative is to further develop our consumer finance solutions offering more buy now pay later option for consumer in order to drive usage growth on our platform. i'll now hand over to antoine, who will walk you through our financial performance in more detail.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeremy. hello, everyone. as mentioned by sacha in the intro monetization performance in q4 2021 was very strong as we reached recognized in terms of revenue, gross profit, and gross profit margin before incentives. and this is allowing us to increase investments in the long-term growth of jumia.
i would like to start with the recap of the building blocks of our revenue on page 20. we present revenue in our financials under three main buckets. the first one is, first-party revenue, which are the proceeds generated from our retail activity. the second one is marketplace revenue, which are the various fields that we proceed from our third-party activity.
the third bucket is, are the revenue which at this stage mainly includes revenue from our logistics as a service activity launch in 2020. this bucket will include in the future revenue from off platform payment processing, once this activity is up and running. let's now look at the overall revenue trajectory in q4 2021. here, we observed three main things.
the first one is the overall revenue growth, which was up 26% year on year, the fastest growth rate of the past two years. i would like to point out that the particularly strong performance of the first-party revenue, which was up over 79% before consumer incentives, which is also the fastest growth rate of the past two years. and this is the result of us undertaking more business on 1p basis, particularly for the built out of the gross reset category. the second observation is the development of new monetization streams, such as advertising or logistics as a service, the major part of the other revenue.
the third observation is that this revenue growth momentum is giving us the flexibility to invest more into growth in the form of consumer incentives, including sales discounts, shipping discounts, and free shipping. let's now deep -- dive deeper in the value components of marketplace revenue on page 21. marketing and advertising revenue increase by 20% supported by robust sell take up of ad solutions, particularly during the black friday campaign. value-added services revenue increased by 63% year over year, mostly as a result of an increase in international logistics revenue.
commissions and fulfillment revenue are both impacted by consumer incentives. excluding this impact, commissions' revenue was up 25%, driven by usage growth, while fulfillment revenue was down 2% as we chose to reduce the shipping back to customers. the diversity of our revenue sources gives us the flexibility to adjust the monetization intensity on certain revenue streams as we execute on our usage growth acceleration strategy. and while we are driving much faster usage growth, we are also reaching record high levels of monetization.
on page 22, you can see that gross profit before the impact of consumer incentives reach an all time high at $44.8 million, accelerating by 24% year on year, while the margin as percentage of gmv reached 13.6%. we made the decision to reinvest some of these monetization gains into our price competitiveness and more attractive shipping tariffs, increasing consumer incentives to 11 million in q4 2021 from 3 million in q4 2020. i would point out here that the q4 2020 levels were very modest and were down 45% compared to q4 2019. despite more than tripling consumer incentives levels, gross profit, which is net of consumer incentives was still up by 2% year on year, and up 22% compared to q4 2019.
similarly, gross profit as a percentage of gmv decreased from 12% in q4 2020 to 10% in q4 2021, which is more than 1.5 percentage point about the margin level of q4 2019. we are overall very pleased with the strong performance of modernization in q4 2021. and we continue building new monetization streams, such as advertising all logistics at the service to further increase the earning power. let's now move on to cost on page 24.
while we are in the phase of expansion and increasing investments, we are maintaining strong cost discipline. as you can see, we continue generating logistics efficiencies on a volume unit basis. fulfilment expense increased by 32% year on year, while orders accelerated by 40% over the same period. fulfilment expense on a per order basis is showing a steady decline over the past two years, reaching $2.7 per order in q4 2021.
moving on to sales and advertising costs page 25. this has been a key area of investment for us in the second half of 2021 after six quarters of significantly reduced marketing spent. in q4 2021, we continued ramping up marketing investment across channels, albeit at a slower pace compared to q3 2021. sales and advertising expense increased by 159% year on year in q4 2021, compared to 228% year on year in q3.
on a compounded basis, sales and advertising expense was at 35% compared to q4 2019. over 57% of the year-on-year increase in sales and advertising expense is coming from the increase in above the line marketing such as offline, tv, and video advertising, which are aim at driving brand awareness and consideration. our sales and advertising spend is discipline and targeted to optimize our overall marketing spend and location by channel, in addition to our existing marketing optimization tools, we are deploying an enhanced return on marketing investment or romi model. this is a customized engine trained on multiple years of jumia data to model the differentiated impact of various marketing activities and channels on customer acquisition and loyalty, informing the marketing budget allocation.
informed by the romi model as well as in-depth customer research in selected markets we'd rebalance our marketing investment mix. we have them so by increasing the share of offline media and video advertising to drag awareness and activation and relining the funnel of consumers. in q4 2021, 50% of our sales and advertising expense was allocated to online marketing campaigns, 41% to offline media and video advertising, and 9% to staff costs. in q4 2020, offline and video advertising accounted for only 17% of the sales and advertising spend with online marketing campaigns and staff cost representing 63% and 20% respectively.
we are confident this targeted and discipline approach will allow us to further improve marketing efficiency as we move beyond the initial phase of a ramp up. turning to technology and g&a expense on page 26. technology is another area of increased investments with technology and content expense reaching $13.1 million up 51% year on year, and 53% compared to q4 2019. tech is the backbone of our platform.
and we are interesting our investments in this area to enhance user experience and engagement on our platform, as well as overall operational efficiency. in q4 2021, we initiated an event of our own page structure and content to simplify navigation and product discovery. to support these thoughts, we have been expanding our technology headcount. in h2 2021, we opened a new tech hub in cairo which housed over 120 technology professionals at the end of 2021, taking the total count of technology staff across the group to over 400.
g&a expense excluding share-based compensation, reached 32 million in q4 2021, up 22% year on year. this was mostly due to a temporary increase in professional fees, as well as an uptake in staff cost as we strengthen the management team selected areas to support the growth of the business. g&a excluding sbc remained 15% lower in q4 2021 compared to their levels in q4 2019, as we maintain cost discipline in this area. before moving on the balance and cash flow items, i'd like to wrap up on monetization and cost with an overview of our priorities on this front in 2022.
page 27 outlines selected initiatives we intend to pursue in 2022 to increase monetization and cost efficiency. on the monetization front, we want diversify our revenue streams and drive more revenue from our platform assets. we want to grow advertising by expanding the range and efficiency of our advertising solutions, while increasing the pickup of these services by our sellers and third-party advertisers. jeremy reflected earlier to jumia express in the context of free shipping.
this is a promising revenue stream that we intend to further develop in conjunction with free shipping as our sellers start to see sales at least from free shipping. last but not least, we intend to further develop our logistics as a service offering to third-party businesses. this activity was rolled out in 2021, and we have seen very good traction there last year. we plan to build on this momentum to acquire more logistics clients and increase revenue from this activity.
the development of newer revenue streams helps us reduce reliance on commissions and shipping fears from consumers, which ultimately support usage growth. on the cost front, we intend to drive more operating leverage and efficiency as we scale the platform. we expect increased volumes to support fulfillment cost efficiency. on the sales and advertising front, we expect our brand awareness and activation investments to gradually translate into new consumer ads order and gmv growth, thereby supporting marketing efficiency.
let's now turn to balance and cash flow items, page 28. capex in q4 2021 was $4.4 million, compared to less $1 million in q4 2020, mostly due to purchases of technology and logistics equipment. net change in working cap resulted in an inflow of $4.1 million in q4. this was mainly a result of an increase in payables relating to the uptick in the first-party activity, as well as a shorter receivable cycle.
cash utilization for the quarter, refinanced cash used in operating and investing activities, excluding investments in financial assets was $66.6 million in q4 2021 supported by the working cap inflow during the quarter. at the end of december 2021, we had a liquidity position of $513 million, $170.1 million of cash, and cash equivalent of $395.7 million of term deposits and other financial assets. with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, antoine. we closed 2021 with strong momentum executing successfully on our growth acceleration strategy. and we posted all time high levels of consumers, orders, gmv new highs in terms of monetization. and the combination of accelerating usage growths and increased monetization are essential stepping stones toward profitability.
we have brought forward today administration of [technical difficulty]

ladies and gentlemen, please hold a moment while we reconnect the speaker.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
hello everyone. i'll take over from sacha. i think he's reconnecting.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
i'm back if you want jeremy.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
ok. no, no, sacha if you're back. no, no, go on. yes, go on sacha.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
ok. great. sorry guys, i got dropped off from the call and we were about to show the nigeria's case study. so we are on page 29.
and here on this slide, we are illustrating how the scale is taking us toward profitability. you can see that we have been accelerating [inaudible]. this is the blue line on the chart in case you're looking at the presentation and we have grown gmv over the last two years. and during q4, by a factor of 1.7, at the same time, we have been accelerating monetization that is represented here as the gross profit after fulfillment and before consumer incentives.
for those, again, looking at the presentation here, we are looking at the orange bar and you can see that we've been growing steadily over the last two years and by a factor of 2.4 in q4. and finally, you can see on this chart as well, our local g&a, which represent our cost structure to run the business locally. now for the last five quarters, the monetization has been paying for the local g&a base. this is one new milestone that we wanted to bring forward as another positive development on the path to profitability.
and on the benefit that scale brings to the business. nigeria, as you are well aware is our largest market represents about 20, 25% of the business, depending on the metrics you take. so it's great to see that our largest market has reached this milestone. on page 30, we have recap here, the key initiatives for 2022, and we would like to share some guidance for 2022.
we intent to further accelerate gmv growth. as a reminder, we grew gmv by 15% in h2 2021 and we intend to continue to build on that momentum. in terms of investments, we are going to deliver that growth acceleration with similar levels of investments as in 2021. for example, we expect to invest between 50 and 55 million in sales and advertising expense in the first half of 2022, this compares with 55 million during h2 of 2021.
so overall, a very similar level of investments and no further increase in absolute terms during the first half of 2022 for sales and advertising. for ebitda, we expect the overall adjusted ebitda loss for the full year to be in a range of 200 to 220. and again, this compares with 197 in 2021. finally, we expect to invest between 15 and 25 million of capex this year.
this is an increase versus 2021 during which we invested 7 million. and this investment is focused on our logistics platform and will allow us to increase our reach, improve the speed of delivery, and deliver also cost efficiencies going forward. once again, we have three priorities for 2022, usage growth, jumiapay development, increased monetization, and cost efficiency. we have very clear initiatives already ongoing to support each.
we're very excited by the prospects of the business in 2022 and beyond and believe we have the -- all the building blocks to take jumia to profitability. thank you very much for your attention. and we're now ready to take your questions.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. and our first question today is coming from aaron kessler at raymond james. your line is live.
you may begin.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you and congrats on the acceleration. a couple questions. first, just maybe on some of the new buyer cohorts.
can you just talk about some of the quality of the new buyers in terms of repeat activity engagement as always kind of concerned with incentives that you were tracking some non-repeat buyers as well? so if you can maybe talk through that. and then maybe in terms of the brand advertising opportunity as well, we see obviously in the u.s. some nice opportunities with fmcg advertisers on platforms like amazon. if you can just talk about what you're seeing there today and maybe the opportunity going forward on the brand advertising side.
thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
great. thank you, aaron. yes, very good question on cohorts and incentive. it's something that we have observed also as well in the past the type of incentives that are being used can drive better cohorts or worse cohorts in some cases.
and very clearly for us, increasing the customer lifetime value and optimizing the customer acquisition cost at the same time is very critical. it's a key objective and we use of course, the sales advertising and the consumer incentives to drive just that. and we're very confident that the type of consumer incentives that are deployed are incrementally driving the customer lifetime value, and that are driving overall long-term increase of the consumer lifetime value, certainly. and in order to measure that, of course, we look at number of kpis, you can see that the number of orders per consumers have been trending in the right direction.
if you look at the quarterly active consumers that we are providing now the kpi, you can see that the number of orders per consumer is increasing. and certainly we think that all the initiatives around what we call the jumia every day, the fmcg, the drive also of free shipping and more personalization, convenience, fmgc, all that is there to increase the frequency and the loyalty of the consumers and that we will continue to see increased kpis with this, so very much confident here. in terms of fmcg, you are very right. certainly we have with many of those big brands that we have displayed on the slide and that jeremy talked about, we have what you call joint business plan, and we work hands in hands with them in order to grow the business in order to grow the online business that they are generating through jumia.
and as part of that, we have joint business plan and we have joint advertising plans. certainly this is driving for us very promising prospects for the advertising revenue. and as we have mentioned in the presentation, we also have a significant part of the fmcg that we do on 1p basis, which is on the retail and the brands there, they're also willing to participate into advertising campaigns and they're supporting our retail with advertising campaigns. so certainly we think that the evolution of jumia toward this mix of category is going to also support the advertising revenues going forward.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you, sacha.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from lamont williams at stifel. your line is live. you may begin.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking the question. sacha, could you just talk a little bit about the change in the operating model for jumiapay in nigeria? could you just give us a little more color on what's -- on what that entails? and then secondly, you mentioned in the release the study from boston consulting group, i think it appears -- looks like some of the customers are looking for more free shipping. is there anything that study else --anything else that that study would have revealed about what your consumers are asking from the platform?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, lamont. on the first question, we have discussions with local regulators with jumiapay, of course, on an ongoing basis. and sometimes we are making adjustments to the operating model and to the type of integrations and processes and flows that are happening. and here this one that is taking place in nigeria and for us, it's very important to maintain this dialogue with the relevant regulators, obviously.
and ensure compliance with existing or anticipated regulations because regulations in fintech and payments in general are evolving on a regular basis. and so here, it's an update to the model and we'll have to see, it's hard to estimate ahead, what are the impacts of those type of changes. but we expect this arrangement to be any way if there's any disruption, we expect any disruption to be transitory right? then -- i'm sorry, your second question lamont is to make sure is on the --
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. any kind of finding from the study with --
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
the study, of course, sorry. yes. so i think the study is really in-depth market study about a range of topics around the consumer and the expectations and the perception of the value proposition and how can we maximize the -- any change that we're making to the value proposition, right? so it's very 360 and help us to do more targeted offering and have a value proposition toward segments, which are more likely to use e-commerce and so and so forth. i think free shipping is one of the conclusions that we have made, right? and we've taken a hard look at the roi of the implementation of free shipping, especially on jumia express, right? of course, we don't do free shipping on everything, we're going to do free shipping on jumia express, which is going to enable us to drive more usage in general, but it's going to also enable us to address some of the concerns that or the expectations around speed of delivery.
because for example, jumia express is delivered faster than the marketplace. and also the consistency of the quality of the products, which are filled on jumia express, because of course we have more control on those. and so i think there's a number of i would say adaptations of the customer experience, which can have higher return on investment than others, improving the return experience for example, accelerating the speed of delivery in certain categories. and so i think there's a lot of let's say, ""small findings"" which are going to help us drive the value proposition forward, right? and those are some of the examples.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. our next question today is coming from luke holbrook at morgan stanley. your line is live.
you may begin.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. thanks for letting me on the call. i had a question just on your sales and advertising spend, that's ramped up quite significantly over the last few quarters, it looks up to do so in the next couple of quarters as well.
can you give us any more detail on where that's being spent on a geographic basis? is this more seen as a push into nigeria, as you kind of alluded to on slide 29 or is this into egypt more? so any color there would be useful and just anything you can provide on your long-term plans here, is this something that we should expect more sustained level of sales and advertising heading into the back part of this year and also kind of 2023 as well. any color there would be useful? thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yes, of course. very good questions, spend is really i would say, well spread across the portfolio of countries and there's not like one very specific geographic will push in one country or the other. and we have accelerated the level of spend pretty much across all countries in h2 of 2021, right. so there would be some nuances to that, but in general, this is an increase that is really well spread and certainly not focused on nigeria or focused more on egypt and quite well balanced, right.
and respecting, i would say the size of our existing operations relative to the size, right. so no particular country focused there that is out of ordinary. and then i think for each one, we really want to invest about 50 million and this is really the same level that we have invested in h2. so here, we don't intend to further increase the levels of investments that we have done in q3, q4, but rather maintain them.
and so we want to see further accelerations of usage metrics with a similar level of spend in absolute terms, at least for h1, right. and that's the guidance we have for the first half. and then we'll take it from there and see the acceleration and continue to observe the customer lifetime value and the level of acceleration that we see. but at least for h1, we have similar level in absolute terms as h2.
and after that, we'll have to see.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very clear. and just one quick follow up, just on slide 29 gave us some illustrative details on nigeria. do you have any plans to disclose more financials on a geographic basis that we kind of see more for spread of your operations?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
well, we certainly are committed to bringing any relevant path to profitability milestone, right. so we have done that in the past several times when [inaudible] certain milestones in the country, it's a very good illustration and to show deep dive of how the business is playing out especially in nigeria in the largest country. so certainly we plan to continue to bring those milestones. and then we have also always volunteered the sort of relative size of the countries, nigeria being 20 to 25%, egypt being around 20% and then having the other countries, all of them being the plus or minus between 5% and 10%, right.
so if that were to change, i think we would also bring it forward. i think the weight of the countries, although we have never published it per se, has not really changed. and we have always volunteered those ratios to give you a sense of the presence. and also the geographical diversity of jumia is one of the amazing assets i think of the company, because we are not overexposed to a given market.
and we are not overexposed to a macro situation in one geography, right. and it's that nice balance. i think that is very attractive for us to have the presence in all those countries and to have some strong foothold in countries like nigeria and egypt, but also strong presence elsewhere. so again like this, we volunteer and for now we have no plans to disclose on a regular basis, specific geographical kpis that we always would volunteer this and highlight if there were any big changes.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's it. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. and our next question today is coming from sarah simon at berenberg. your line is live.
you may begin.
sarah simon -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. i apologies if there's background noise, i'm in transit but just had a question about the growth acceleration that you talk about. you referenced growth acceleration relative to the second half of fiscal 2021, which i think was about 15%.
so is that the benchmark against which you are expecting to accelerate, or should we really be thinking q3 was less growth than q4, q1 should be more growth than q4 and so on. so just a bit more color on how you are thinking about that acceleration would be helpful. thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yes. well, look, sarah, thank you for the question. at this stage, really, i think we want to see more acceleration versus where we are now, right. so the benchmark for us, because there can be some quarterly variations and so on and so forth.
we want to make sure that we are accelerating versus where we come from at least on an h2 basis, right. so of course then there's gmv orders, consumers we are expecting to accelerate and the benchmark for us right now in h2. then of course, as we see it coming, we'll publish more data, but for now, this is the benchmark that we use.
sarah simon -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks.

sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you very much. welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. before going into the specifics of performance, i would like to briefly remind you of our current strategy on page 3. we are currently focused on scaling our platform in order to build a fast growing and profitable business in e-commerce and fintech in africa.
we have built very strong foundations for our platform, tailored to the specifics of our markets in africa, the marketplace, the logistics platform, jumiapay, payment and fintech solutions. we played the long game from the very beginning to position us for long-term growth and profitability. with this in place, we focused on building robust, unit economics. the sequencing here is very important.
we wanted to first set solid unit economics for the business before accelerating growth. we reached the important milestone of positive order contribution after logistic cost, and it's now been the case for 10 consecutive quarters. in parallel, we strengthened our balance sheet, raising $570 million in 2021 and 2020. and we worked on enhancing the diversity and the relevance of our marketplace, and now two-thirds of our gmv is coming from everyday product categories.
on that basis, strong platform, strong unit economics, we are now scaling the business toward profitability. the three key building blocks to achieve profitability: number one, accelerating usage growth; number two, accelerating monetization; and number three, improving cost efficiency. of course, jumiapay remains a priority for us to drive the long-term value creation. now let's go into our quarterly highlights.
in q1, we've delivered a strongly on each of those building blocks. page 4, accelerating usage growth. in q1, we posted the fastest year-on-year gmv and order growth of the past nine quarters, 27% and 40%, respectively. next page, accelerating monetization.
excluding consumer incentives, which are marketing investments, revenue and gross profit year-over-year growth rates also reached their highest levels over the past nine quarters, 56% and 31%. number three, next page, improving cost efficiency. sales advertising per order and as a percentage of gmv, both reached their best levels of the past four quarters, $2 per order and 7.5% of gmv. and this improvement is taking place while we are accelerating usage growth.
consumer incentives, efficiency. consumer incentives are accounted for as revenue deduction. this efficiency is also improving sequentially reaching 15% in q1, compared to 18% in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. this is very much in line with what we communicated to the market in our last release.
back then, we said that the focus for sales advertising over the subsequent quarters would be to increase the efficiency, and that's exactly what we achieved in q1. finally, before going into more details, we move to page 7, our adjusted ebitda loss. we have, of course, been closely monitoring the fundamental macro and market shifts, which have been taking place over the past few months and which are still unfolding. we are very confident in our path and execution toward profitability.
in terms of adjusted ebitda, we believe we are past the peak of quarterly adjusted ebitda loss that was reached in q4 2021. we also reiterate the guidance of $200 million to $220 million adjusted ebitda loss for the full year of 2022. and starting from 2023, we expect to begin decreasing the adjusted ebitda loss on a year-over-year basis. now i'll hand over to jeremy to give more color and highlights of our q1 results.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, sacha. hello, everyone. we're on page 9. we are executing with consistency and discipline to accelerate the usage growth.
our overarching objective continues to be further enhancing jumia as the digital destination for everyday needs and occasional opportunities in africa through a combination of marketing, commercial, logistics and technology levers. on marketing, we continue our investments in consumer adoption and retention. the brand awareness is crucial, particularly as we operate in nascent e-commerce markets. we are very pleased to see jumia ranked no.
6 in the 2021 most influential brand survey in egypt by ipsos out of a total of 180 international and local brands, up from seventh position the year before. importantly, we became no. 1 in the digital and e-commerce category for the second year in a row. this is a very good achievement as egypt is our second largest market and the one where we operate alongside amazon.
this is a testimony to the strong execution of our team on the ground and i want to thank them for their efforts. we are also incredibly grateful to our customers for their trust, and we continue to work very hard on bringing them more convenience and relevance. on commercial, we're focusing our execution on, first, penetrating the everyday products categories. in q1 2022, we added almost 1 million skus in the fmcg category, the highest number of sku add in this category in the past eight quarters.
we continue to work very closely with brands. an example of that is the pan-african partnerships we established with each of coca-cola and danone across both our e-commerce and food delivery platforms. on logistics, our current execution focuses on further improving the speed of delivery and its cost effectiveness. for example, we are rolling out next-day free shipping on jumia express items of basket sizes above the minimum threshold.
jumia express is an end-to-end logistics service provided to sellers, where items are stored in our warehouse and picked and packed by jumia. in q1 2022, while we were still in the early days of this rollout, we already had 57% of shipped packages reaching consumers within 24 hours of order placing. last but not least, technology enhancement is a key area to accelerate usage growth. thanks to increased tech headcount, we are accelerating product development and new features rollouts.
in q1 2022, we released a revamped version of our homepage, even product description pages for a more easy to use and engaging experience on the platform. the consistent execution on these four levers is what's driving the strong growth acceleration that you can see on page 10. on page 10, first, in q1 2022 versus q1 2021, we had more consumers buying more often. that's exactly the kind of play we want to see on our platform.
quarterly active consumers reached 3.1 million at 29% year over year as a result of robust increases in both new and returning customers. we have enjoyed a consistent increase in quarterly purchase frequency over the past five quarters, reaching three orders per quarterly active consumer in q1 this year, compared to 2.7 orders in the same quarter the year before. second, we perceived in q1 the fastest order and gmv growth rate of the past nine quarters. orders accelerated by 40% year over year, reaching 9.3 million.
we also perceived strong gmv growth, notwithstanding the fx headwinds, with gmv reaching $252.7 million, a 27% year over year and 35% on a constant currency basis. just to give you a bit more color on the fx dynamics of this quarter, we had 10 of our 11 local currency depreciating against the dollar, in particular the nigerian naira, the west african cfa franc, and the moroccan dirham depreciated by 9%, 7%, and 6%, respectively against the dollar in q1 this year compared to q1 2021. regardless of the fx volatility, there is very strong, broad-based momentum across the business. on page 11, you can see that all product categories are growing in both gmv and item sold terms.
despite the volatility in the supply chain situation for phone and electronics, we drove positive inflection in q1 in each category, which contributed to both gmv and item sold growth. the everyday product categories continue to be important growth drivers, and i'd like to call out the fmcg and food delivery categories, which really stood out in terms of volume growth in q1 2022. fmcg was up 180% year over year while food delivery was up 86% as we leverage both our e-commerce and food delivery platforms to meet the every day needs of consumers in food items and staples. the strong volume growth in this category is also translating into robust gmv growth with fmcg and food delivery, growing by 75% and 61% year over year, respectively, the strong growth in everyday product category over the past two years drove a fundamental shift in gmv.
on page 12, you can see that phone and electronics went from accounting 45% of gmv in q1 2020 to 33% in q1 2022. in contrast, both jumiapay app service and food delivery saw the contribution to gmv increase by four percentage points over this period from 9% to 11%, respectively, in q1 2022. within the everyday product category, the home and fashion category remained consistently the largest two product category, each commanding a mid to high teens share of the gmv. average order values stood at $27 in q1 as we further penetrate more affordable, smaller ticket price categories.
this strategy of increased product category diversification in favor of everyday items is not only a major driver of growth acceleration, it is also providing more resilience to our business model as we increase our exposure to staple categories. and that's crucial in periods of macro volatility, such as the one we are currently going through. compared to a couple of years ago, our platform is bigger, faster, growing, and much more diversified and resilient. let's now move on to another key priority for us, which is jumiapay page 14.
we achieved a major milestone in q1 as we were granted by the central bank of nigeria a payment service solution provider license or pssp license. this is an instrumental license that will allow us to start offering jumiapay payment processing solutions off-platform in nigeria. we have now obtained the relevant licenses to start off-platform payment processing in our two largest markets, nigeria and egypt. we intend to scale the business progressively and in a disciplined manner to ensure the quality and safety of payment solutions for merchants and consumers, both on and off platform.
over the next few months, we will be focused on adapting our payment product suite for an off-platform environment and build out additional relevant features for supporting merchants. in parallel, we continue expanding the range of digital and financial services available to consumers on the jumiapay app. we have provided here the example of an e-doctor service that we are piloting in nigeria, allowing consumers to access doctors remotely for a monthly subscription fee of $1. this initiative is in partnership with the cgap, consultative group to assist the poor, a global partnership of more than 30 leading development organizations, as well as meeting doctors, a digital health service provider.
let's now move on to the performance of jumiapay on platform, talking with tpv, page 15. jumiapay tpv increased by 37% year over year and 45% on a constant currency basis. despite the fx headwind, tpv posted its fastest growth rate in usd terms over the past five quarters, supported by the same growth in gmv. tpv penetration as a percentage of gmv reached a new high of 28% in q1, up from 26% in q1 the year before as we focus on increasing the penetration of jumiapay in a disciplined and gradual manner.
turning to transactions on page 16. jumiapay transactions reached 3.2 million in q1, up 32% year over year, supported by accelerating volume growth across the business and industry delivery category in particular. overall, 34% of orders placed in q1 2022 were completed using jumiapay compared to 37% in q1 in 2021. here, i want to flag that we did increase jumiapay transactions penetration as a percentage of orders across jumia e-commerce and food delivery platform.
we see very good transaction momentum in our e-commerce and food delivery platform, where juniper transaction growth outpace the growth of jumiapay app transactions. because the jumiapay penetration is 100% on the jumiapay app, the reduced share of jumiapay app in the transaction mix led to a decline in the overall jumiapay transactions penetration as a percentage of orders. overall, the growth momentum of jumiapay on platform is very robust and we are very excited to embark on the next phase of our journey in payments as we prepare to take our payment solution off platform. i now hand over to antoine, who will walk you through our financial performance in more detail.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeremy. hello, everyone. i will start with the monetization performance, which illustrates the progress on the second building block of our path to profitability, accelerating monetization. we want to balance, first, usage growth with robust monetization of our platform as we build a diversified monetization engine.
that's exactly what we achieved in q1 '22. on page 18, you can see that as we posted strong usage growth, we delivered the fastest revenue and gross profit growth rate in over two years, excluding consumer incentives, which are marketing investments in nature at 56% and 31% year on year, respectively. fx was a headwind to top-line growth this quarter. so on a constant currency basis, these rates are even higher at 65% and 38% year on year, respectively.
let's now unpack revenue growth dynamics on page 19. as a reminder, we have three main revenue components. the first one is the first party revenue that we earn on business undertaken in the first party or retail basis. the second one is the market-based revenue, which are the various fees that we are -- we generate from all third-party activities.
the third component is other revenue, which at this stage mainly includes revenue from all logistics-as-a-service activity launched in 2020. this bucket will include in the future revenue from off-platform payment processing once these activities are up and running. in terms of revenue trajectory, we observe three main things. first, the strong revenue growth at 44% from $33 million in q1 '21 to $47.6 million in q1 '22.
the growth was even stronger in constant currency, down at 53% year on year. revenue growth was supported by a strong acceleration in first-party revenue, which was up by a factor of 2.5 as we undertook more business on a retail basis within our grocery category. second, we are seeing very good traction on our newer monetization streams, such as advertising or logistics-as-a-service, which is a major part of other revenue. third, this revenue growth momentum is giving us the flexibility to invest into growth in the form of consumer incentives, including sales discounts, shipping discounts, and free shipping.
let's now dive deeper into the values components of marketplace revenue on page 20. excluding the impact of consumer incentives, marketplace revenue was up 25% year on year and 32% on a constant currency basis. this was supported by the strong momentum in value-added services in marketing and advertising revenue streams. value-added services increased by 49% year on year, partly as a result of an increase in international logistics revenue.
marketing and advertising was up 40% year on year, supported by an acceleration in the number of advertising campaigns, which was up 55% year on year as we run over 480 campaigns on behalf of almost 9,000 advertising clients. advertising clients during the quarter included high profile brand partners such as unilever, l'oreal, adidas, xiaomi, coca cola, krispy kreme, burger king, and many more. commissions and fulfillment revenue are both impacted by consumer incentives. excluding this impact, commissions revenue was at 29% driven by usage growth, while fulfillment revenue was up 4% as we choose to reduce the shipping vessel to customers.
moving on to gross profit on page 21. we drove a significant step up in gross profit before the impact of consumer incentives, which accelerated by 31% year over year and 38% in constant currency while the margin as a percentage of gmv reached 13.8%, up almost 40 bps year on year. we are leveraging the strong level of underlying monetization to invest more into price competitiveness and shipping discounts, allowing us to increase the amount of consumer incentives from $2.1 million in q1 '21 to $7.2 million in q1 '22. going forward, the growth in monetization will be partly reinvested to fund our free shipping initiative.
even after the impact of consumer incentives, the growth trajectory and monetization over a two year period is very strong. between q1 '20 and q1 '22, gross profit was up 36%. we are all very pleased with the strong monetization performance in q1 '22 and are even more excited by the new revenue streams we are developing. in this context, i would like to give you more color on page 22 on one of these new revenue streams, our logistics-as-a-service offering.
at the beginning of our journey, logistics was one of the most challenging aspects of operating environment. with multiple hurdles, such as a lack of addresses, a lack of organized and reliable capacity, storage space issues, the predominance of cash on delivery and so on. ten years into our journey, we can confidently say that we've cracked most of these issues. we have built a tech-rich, asset-light logistics platform with strong reach across our countries of operation.
our network counts over 700 logistics partners that we manage and integrate to our platform through a dedicated tech stack. we also have an extensive physical network of 50,000 square meter of warehousing space, and we have 3,000 drop off and pick up stations. today, we are in a position to help other businesses overcome this infrastructure challenges by giving them access to our logistics platform. we offer end-to-end logistics services from warehousing and pick packing to door delivery and payment collection with full visibility and tracking of the journey of the package.
our offering is familiar and can be adjusted under -- on account basis to suit the needs of our logistics clients. we are seeing very good demand from the sellers. the number of packages shipped in q1 '22 reached a new record of 3.5 million, generating over $1.2 million in revenue from more than 1,250 clients. let's now move onto cost, starting with fulfillment expense on page 24.
fulfillment is largely a viable cost and evolved in line in volumes in q1 '22. as we grew orders by 40% year on year, fulfillment expense was up 42% and 50% on a constant currency basis. here, i would like to point out that fulfillment expense includes both the costs associated with jumiapay platform orders and the costs associated with our logistics-as-a-service offering. the number of packages within this activity increased significantly from 0.8 million in q1 '21 to 3.5 million in q1 '22.
moving on to sales and advertising expense, page 25. as mentioned by jeremy earlier, marketing investments are a core level to drive usage growth, and we continued increasing these investments on a year on year basis in q1 '22. sales and advertising expense reached $18.8 million, up 94% year on year and 99% on a constant currency basis. that's in the context of a very low comp base over the past two years with sales and advertising expense significantly curtailed in 2020 and up until the middle of 2021.
when we take a three-year perspective, the q1 '22 sales and advertising amount is modestly above pre-pandemic levels with a three-year cagr of 12%. the main change is the channel mix of marketing investments with an increased share allocated to both the nine channels such as tv, radio, video advertising, etc., from 28% in q1 '19 to 37% in q1 '22. when we look at the sequential trends over the past nine months, we can see that we are slowing down the pace of marketing investment increases for 228% and 159% year on year in the third and fourth quarters of '21 to 94% year on year in q1 '22. as we move beyond the initial phase of marketing ramp up of h2 '21, we are stabilizing the levels of marketing investments and starting to generate better marketing efficiency.
on page 26, we can see different significant improvements sequentially in marketing efficiency metrics. sales and advertising expense per order and as a percentage of gmv both reached in q1 '22 their lowest levels in four quarters at $2 per order and 7.5% of gmv. this is an important development in our progress toward profitability as we are scaling the business while improving marketing efficiency. moving on to technology and g&a costs on page 27.
technology continues to be an important area of investment for us to support the long-term growth of our business, both on the e-commerce and payment fronts. technology expense reached $13 million in q1 '22, up 56% year on year and 62% on a constant currency basis as we increase technology headcount to support innovation and product development. g&a, excluding sbc, reached $13.1 million in q1 '22, up 23% year on year and 30% on a constant currency basis. this is mostly due to an increased hiring in the second half of '21 to strengthen the management team in selected areas to support the long-term growth of the business.
on a sequential basis, g&a, excluding sbc, was down 6% compared to q4 '21. we believe we have the right team structure at this stage and expect the g&a base to remain relatively stable going forward as we reinforce strong discipline on hiring and overhead costs. turning on to adjusted ebitda loss, page 28. adjusted ebitda loss reached $55.3 million in q1 '22, up 17% year on year and 26% on a constant currency.
the year-over-year comparison is impacted by a low base in q1 '21, where adjusted ebitda loss was down 17% year on year. importantly, as mentioned by sacha earlier, we believe we are now past the peak of adjusted ebitda losses, which was reached in q4 '21. let's now move on to balance sheet and cash flow items on page 29. capex in q1 '22 was $1.7 million.
we are yet to see the effect of logistics investments as we guided toward $15 million to $25 million of capex in 2022 for a logistics capacity expansion upgrade, which will be mostly carried out over the second half of '22. that change in working capital resulted in an outflow of $23.4 million in q1 '22. historically, working cap had a relatively neutral cash flow impact on a yearly basis. that said, it can be impacted quarterly by cut-off effects and upfront prepayment.
this was the case in q1 '22, where we paid upfront the cost of yearly hosting services to take care of better pricing. cash utilization for the quarter was $28.2 million in q1 '22, impacted by the working capital outflow during the quarter. at the end of march '22, we had a liquidity position of $421 million comprised of $89 million of cash and cash equivalents and $333 million of term deposits and other financial assets. with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, antoine. thank you, jeremy. i think a very strong quarter of execution on our strategy to scale the business toward profitability and importantly, the quarter where we can see some concrete results on the three building blocks of our path to profitability. and we have clear initiatives underway to make even more progress on each one.
on usage growth, we all know there is no profitability without bigger scale. you've heard us say it multiple times in the past. in q1, we accelerated growth very nicely. fastest order growth, fastest gmv growth rates of the past nine quarters.
and as we look ahead, we intend to maintain this good momentum that we currently have on usage growth by continuing our execution on all relevant areas of the business. and here it's not just maintaining marketing investments and improving their efficiency, it's about keeping the great work that we've been doing on the everyday product categories. it's about going to the next level on the logistics fronts with the roll out of the next-day free shipping and free delivery on jumia express. and of course, it's about continuing to build great technology to offer even more seamless and engaging experience for the consumers on the platform.
on monetization, we want bigger scale to drive more revenues in gross profit dollars. we do not believe in the growth model that frontloads scale without a robust monetization model in place. in q1, excluding consumer incentives, we recorded the fastest revenue and gross profit growth rate in over two years, and we still have great upside to accelerate monetization, leveraging the diversified engine that we have built. on first-party revenue, we grew first-party revenue by over 80% year over year.
over the past nine months, this is now allowing us to further enhance our margins and regularly negotiate volume rebates with our suppliers. on the marketplace, same logic applies. we're leveraging the accelerating usage growth to extract more monetization. we have brought a lot of growth over the last nine months to our third-party sellers and today we have room to increase commission, take rates in a number of categories.
we've already started doing that. but of course, as always in a gradual and disciplined manner. and as we have referred earlier to the roll out of the free next-day delivery in jumia express, this is an enabler for us to increase the monetization of jumia express. so lots of opportunities in the marketplace.
in addition, further monetization upsides on advertising, logistic-as-a-service, which are still nascent today but we have very good traction, as you have seen and we have potential also here for a lot of growth. and finally, we have now obtained the license in egypt and nigeria to take jumiapay off-platform and this is a long term, very exciting, meaningful revenue growth opportunity. it's not a prerequisite for us to reach breakeven, but it will be incremental monetization upside to give us even more flexibility and optionality in our path to profitability. and finally, on the third building block, cost efficiency in q1, you've seen our marketing efficiency improve both on a per order basis and percentage of gmv, reaching their lowest level in the past four quarters.
we still have meaningful potential to drive further efficiency gains in marketing, generate operating leverage on tech and g&a with reinforced client discipline across the cost structure and the overheads in particular. for the full year 2022, we continue to focus on the three building blocks and here we take the opportunity to reiterate and add on the guidance that we provided during the last quarter release, which is that we expect further acceleration, year-on-year gmv growth in 2022, compared to what we saw in h2 of last year, where the growth was 15%. we're stabilizing the level of marketing investments and we confirmed that we expect to invest between $50 million and $55 million in sales advertising through the first half of 2022. and this compares with $55 million in h2 of 2021.
so very similar level of investment. and this is why we call this stabilization. then we expect -- we confirm, i would say, to expect to invest between $15 million and $25 million of capex this year. of course, we are very cash disciplined that we're committed to investing in the long-term strength of the platform.
and the capex investment will be focused on the legacy platform, obviously, and will allow us to increase our reach, increase our speed of delivery, and drive also cost efficiency going forward. and we also confirm that we expect an adjusted ebitda loss for the full year between 200 and 220 compared with 197 last year. and on a quarterly basis, we believe that we are past the peak of adjusted ebitda loss, which was reached in q4. and starting from 2023, we expect to begin decreasing the adjusted ebitda loss on a year over year basis.
and now before going in to q&a, those -- this was a lot of numbers, but let's just remind ourselves for a second of the huge opportunities that we are pursuing here and as well as the great impact that we are having on the continent and beyond. we believe we have decades of growth ahead of us. there are hundreds of millions of potential consumers, who will enter the market over the coming decades. the market opportunity is massive.
nigeria will be the third most populous country on the planet in 20, 30 years, just after china and india. egypt is an amazing market. we have spent years building a platform to serve those consumers. this is very hard and this is very unique.
we have a very strong position in our market. and you've seen in egypt, no. 1 e-commerce brand. what we're doing today is both addressing our ongoing path to profitability and laying ground to capture the long-term opportunity.
and last but not least, we're impacting the lives of millions of consumers and sellers across the continent. thank you very much for your attention. and we are now ready for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question is coming from aaron kessler with raymond james. sir, please post your question.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. a couple of questions. maybe first, just on the consumer incentives.
now that you've been running the consumer incentives for a couple of quarters now, can you just talk about maybe the effectiveness of that and maybe a conversion rate and maybe the roi of those customers that are using consumer incentives in terms or repeat shopping, etc.? and then just maybe on the lower sales and marketing spend in the quarter, are you finding more marketing efficiencies kind of versus prior quarters or is that just maybe a step down more due to kind of q1 seasonality? thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks, aaron. very good questions. on the consumer incentives, consumer incentive is, for us, completely integrated into our marketing strategy, which is to drive the customer lifetime value for the long term, right? so here we have different stages of the funnel for the consumers, from driving the awareness of the existence of jumia to driving the adoption. and then as we drive the adoption to drive the the loyalty and the repeat purchase, which ultimately form the customer lifetime value.
and in terms of consumer incentives, we have different types, of course, right? so there is certain consumer incentives, which are price reductions of certain products, where we tend to lower the products. for example, we lower the price of a product to drive adoption and to drive repeat. there are certain coupons and vouchers, which can be distributed to various segments of consumers based on the objective that we have for those. for example, to make them discover a new category or to make them discover jumia express or to make them buy for the first time, lots of different types of strategies to engage the various segments, which are there.
and then of course, there is the shipping fee reduction that we are financing for the free shipping program. so here we have a, i would say, a wide range of strategies, which are at play when it comes to consumer incentives. and they are, as i said, an integral part of our strategy to drive the long-term clv. and as you pointed out, we started to ramp up the investment in consumer incentives together with the ramp up in sales advertising.
i think it was more or less during the q2 of last year, right. so i think here we are, we have a lot of learnings and we optimize -- we continue to optimize. we see strong efficiency and we're quite happy with what we're seeing and i think it's driving a lot of clv overall. in terms of sales and advertising, it's here.
i think we are maintaining and we're stabilizing the investments from h2. and there's certainly a little bit of seasonality, which is always happening in q1 because it's the new year, it's post-christmas, it's post year-end spend and so on, so forth. but i think here we've seen some pretty good improvement of efficiency. and so to me, there is going to be always some variations in the amount of sales and advertising that we spend.
i think we will always expect to spend a little bit more in q4 than in q1. but i think the efficiency levels that we're seeing, we're confident that we can continue to gradually sustain them and gradually improve them over time. so they are not -- the increased efficiency is not particularly related to spending less. and we think that we will in the long term continue to drive efficiency.

thank you. our next question is coming from lamont williams with stifel. sir, please post your question.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. sacha, thanks for taking my question. the first question i have is what are you seeing from your buyers on the platform in the midst of some of the macro challenges with high inflation and whatnot? and what do you expect you'll see kind of as we go through the balance of the year? and then i have a follow up.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, it's a very important question and i think it's still unfolding in many ways, right, because many things are happening almost on a daily basis and impacting the consumers, the supply, the prices, and as you say, and whatnot, as you said, right. so there's a lot. look, i think at the end of the day, we are amazingly well positioned because we are offering a very wide range of assortment and we are offering solutions and access to consumers of products, which are very relevant with our position in the everyday categories and with very good prices.
so at the end of the day, we are a reflection of the supply. and whatever disruption is happening on the supply, of course, will disrupt the supply everywhere. but the beauty of jumia is that we bring this amazing assortment, we bring this amazing experience, and we bring very good prices. so consumers will still need to buy everyday products.
they will still need to do that. and if at all, when there is more pressure, i would say, on prices or on the wallets, consumers are more picky and consumers compare more, and i think that positions us very well, right? so i think we're pretty confident that whatever happens, we are relevant and we will be relevant given our positioning and given our value proposition. and now, of course, some categories will suffer, right? in some categories, consumer will trade down and more consumers will delay some purchases, so be it. i think not all categories will do well this year, but we will do well because we are well positioned on everything and on everyday category especially.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then on -- more of a longer term question, you talked about a couple of interesting third -- off-platform initiatives with jumiapay. how are you thinking about monetization over time? is there any kind of timing around that and kind of what can expect to see that, how can we expect to see that to develop over time?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. i think i mean we're starting to see -- on the two off-platforms, we have two -- advertising is more of on-platform. we have advertising and then we have jumiapay and then we have jumia logistics and advertising. i think it's moving well.
you can see very good growth rate this quarter and we are rolling out a lot of solutions to help brands advertise on jumia. and i think this is an area that will continue. it's starting to show some really impact and will continue in the future. the second one, of course, logistics.
we start to display some numbers and we -- you've seen the the number of of packages that we that we shipped this quarter, that we have over 1,000 clients and that we start to generate over 1 million of revenue. so i think this is moving well and we see here the long term opportunity, which is very big in logistics. of course, it's not a secret that logistic in africa is very hard and i think we've developed something that is absolutely unique. and i mean, 57% of our shipped packages reach consumers within 24 hours in africa, right? i mean, this is, i think, exceptional.
so this asset, i think we're going to continue to develop it and bring you bring you the numbers. we don't give specific guidance because it's still early days and as we have more visibility and so on, we'll bring more guidance. i think for now we bring the numbers as they are and we are committed to continuing to grow it without giving particular guidance. i think on jumiapay, jumiapay is a long term very, very important asset for us.
and here you don't go lightly into starting to process third-party payments, right? this is a new area. and the first step is to get the license, and this step is is already a huge achievement on its own, right? so to get a license, you have to develop a number of processes and you have to, of course, apply to the central bank and then pass a number of audits and verifications and so on. and we've obtained that, which speaks very highly of the quality of the product that we have built, our level of compliance, our level of execution on jumiapay. and now that we have those licenses, we are going to tailor our solution to the merchants and start rolling it out, right.
so i think we are still several quarters away from showing meaningful revenue because we are now in the phase of adapting the product to take it to the market, right? so this is more something that i think will start abating at least in a few quarters.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from sarah simon with berenberg. ma'am, please post your question.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yes. afternoon. i've got a couple of questions. first one was on working capital.
and you -- there was a comment in the release about taking on more first-party inventory. so i'm just wondering how we should think about working capital in that context going forward, because i assume that you've got to pay for the goods before you start selling them. that was the first thing. the second one was on the repeat purchase rate.
can you give us an idea? because i don't think you've ever told us this, what proportion of your customers, let's say in the current quarter, the active customers, are people who have previously shopped on jumia or maybe think that the other way, which is what percentage of the customer growth came from completely new customers. that would be helpful. and then the final one was just in terms of the phasing of advertising. obviously, your guidance for h1 implies quite a lot of increase in spending in q2.
can you just remind us what sort of promotional weeks there are in q2 versus q1? if it's to do with kind of advertising to the event or if there's something else behind that phasing? thanks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, no. thank you, sarah. i think to start with the last one because it's kind of the easiest, is we usually do the jumia anniversary in june or sometimes in july depends on a number of things. as you know, calendar their dates around ramadan and the rainy season in some country and so on but it's -- in this year, it will take place in june and this year is the 10-year anniversary of jumia.
so this is typically a good opportunity for us to bring lots of good prices, good deals, and just good momentum for our sellers and our consumers. so that's why in q2 you will see more investment than one is for this specific anniversary, right. [inaudible] working capital --
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. and then with jumia anniversary last year, when did you anniversary last year?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. you have to refresh exactly the date. i believe last year was also fully in june, but to some countries overlapping in july. i would say, most of the countries fall in june and some of them june and july.
we can follow it separately to make sure you have that. when you release q2 and we will we will provide such comparison to make sure that there is no calendar effect. on the working capital, yes. well, i think we are conducting more first party because i think it's -- the market requires it and it's a good opportunity for us.
i think we are going to see the inventory level continue to increase. but at the same time, we're getting also increased payment terms over time, right? so i'm not sure the net net impact on the cash would be significant. if inventory was to increase or will increase, i think we will also get payment terms and we tend to have -- to do retail on high turning skus, right. so we don't tend to buy, let's say, for next year's fashion collection, right? we would buy some fmcg for the next few weeks or we would buy some in electronics for the 10-year anniversary or something like that, right? so i don't think that we would see a meaningful, meaningful impact on working capital because the increase in inventory would be compensated by increased payment terms or by just short selling cycle.
right? ok. and then i think on co-host. yes. i mean, there's a number of questions, i think, here.
we've been publishing in the past some some data point on loyalty, some data point on the speed of returning, and new consumers. and so here, i will simply answer quantitatively that we are seeing very good momentum both on the loyalty and on the adoption. at some point in the future, we hope or we may decide to publish more data. it's hard to just comment here quantitatively without giving the numbers.
but quantitatively, i can tell you that we are seeing good momentum in both adoption and loyalty.
sarah simon -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from luke holbrook with morgan stanley. sir, please post your question.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. thank you for allowing me on the call. i was just going to ask you on from a unique economics perspective. on the one hand, you're making quite a few efforts to improve consumer frequency, but on the other hand, average order values have declined, i think, 9% year on year in the first quarter.
so just basically wondering how that impacts your roadmap to profitability, where you think that the average order value start to stabilize? and i just got a follow up after that. thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah. thank you for the question, luke. i think you're right. the average order value is going down 9% and i think this is expected.
and i think this is a trend that will continue. it's hard to predict exactly where the auv is going to stand, but certainly i think we continue and we will continue to see it coming down over time, maybe not at the speed, but here it's hard to predict. and i think you see that -- i mean, over the last few years, we've managed to really build a sustainable unit economics to drive the profits of the orders. and you see the gross profit has moved from $3.4 to $4 now to $3.7.
but i would say this is quite positive that despite going from 33 to 27, we managed to keep the same dollars per gross profit, right? so as a percentage of auv, we're now almost at 14% of gross profit. so we've managed to grow, by four points as we saw the average order value going down. the fulfillment expense, we managed to capture slight efficiency. of course, here there are lots of things which are at play and so we're still generating $1 out of the out of the 27 after fulfillment.
so i think we're seeing that our business model is very adaptive and managed to adapt to the shifts that has been happening toward the everyday category. and now it's really about rolling out all these initiatives that we mentioned on driving more revenues and driving better margins on retail, driving better commissions and pass through on the marketplace, driving more monetization of jumia express, increasing advertising revenues. now that we also work even more with fmcg, we attempted we have the opportunity to tap into the marketing contributions of those suppliers and wholesalers and then logistics and logistics and jumiapay. and as we roll out all those, we need to see the dollar value of the gross profit after fulfillment increase.
so i think here we are certainly not worried by the drop of the auv. it's something we are actually driving. we are in a good place, but we want to be in an even better place and continue to drive more monetization to improve our gross profit and to grow the absolute dollars that we're making after fulfillment.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and also just as a follow-up, in the last couple of years, you've been impacted a little bit by supply chain issues, sourcing of goods in the current inflationary environment, and the issues that have resulted across the world, how does that impact you? going forwards, will this result in kind of a buildup in inventory? and just as another side point as well, can you just comment on the local press reports on the possible bid to acquire the company, would be helpful. thank you.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yeah, of course. i think the supply chain, i believe really that i mean, a lot of the negative impacts during the covid year was about the curfews and local disruptions of not being able to move the products around, having our sellers not being able to come and deliver in our warehouse because of restrictions of movements and things like that, which were really, really impacted, almost like the supply chain, but from a logistics perspective, right? the issues that we see in the supply chain in terms of access and products not arriving or not leaving china or things like that have been happening, will continue to happen. and this is, i think, the answer i was i was giving to the earlier question, which is we are a reflection of the market. we're very well positioned with the everyday category so whenever there's some disruption in a category, it's going to impact the category.
but overall, people still need to function, if i may use that expression, right, and they will come and look for the categories that they need and for the everyday categories, which are extremely important and extremely relevant, right? so i think this is what we expect for that. now, in terms of the market rumors, we do not comment on, i would say, such speculations and as per the u.s. securities law, any shareholder who has more than 5% needs to make himself known. so i guess that's what we would expect.
so here we cannot comment on speculations like that. but again, if any one person passes the 5%, they will have to make themselves known.
luke holbrook -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thank you.

sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you very much, safae. welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. i would like to share a few highlights of our q2 performance and give you an update on our strategy and guidance. we are committed to taking the business to breakeven and in that regard, have delivered a strong quarter with very good progress on each building block of our path to profitability.
number one, usage growth. as you know, scale is a driver of profitability. orders and quarterly active consumers were up 35% and 25%. gmv grew by 21% in q2, 34% on a constant currency basis.
this happened in a volatile macro context with increasing pressure on consumer spend and access to supply for our sellers. it also happened with very strong discipline on marketing investments from our side. for us, it's a clear sign that our focus on relevant everyday products, competitive prices and consumer experience is paying off. number two, monetization acceleration.
revenue was up 42% and 56% on a constant currency basis. we posted the fastest marketplace revenue and gross profit growth rates of the past five quarters at 17% and 14%, respectively. we want larger scale to be a catalyst for revenue growth and the diversified monetization engine we have built allows us to drive revenue from both consumer usage and the assets of our platform. number three, cost efficiency.
cost discipline is a top priority for us even more so in the current context. we drove usage growth and monetization acceleration with lower-than-expected marketing investments. sales and advertising expense reached usd 41 million in h1 compared to our guidance of usd 50 million to usd 55 million. g&a was another area of increased efficiency for us with g&a, excluding share-based compensation expense being flat year over year, and declining sequentially by 12%.
so overall, some very good progress in q2. the macro picture is challenging. however, the fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. if we now look ahead, i'm turning to page four.
our strategic focus is to make strong progress on profitability. we have outlined here our near-term guidance, which reflects this continued focus. on usage, despite the macro, we aim to maintain robust usage growth, and we reiterate our guidance of gmv growth in excess of 15% for the full year in usd terms. on monetization, we plan to accelerate.
we expect gross profit in h2 of usd 75 million to usd 85 million. this implies year-on-year growth of 27%, up to 44%, which is at least double the growth rate of q2, so a significant acceleration. on the cost efficiency front, we are doubling down on the cost discipline. in particular, we expect to drive further marketing efficiencies, leveraging the long-term investments we made over the past year in brand awareness and consideration.
for h2, we expect sales and advertising of usd 35 million to usd 45 million, implying year-over-year savings of 18% up to 37%. so in summary, we're going to keep growing usage. we're going to accelerate gross profit growth and do this with even more cost efficiency. as a result, and i'm now turning to page five.
we believe that we have turned the corner and are past the peak of adjusted ebitda losses that was reached in q4 of last year in 2021. for h2, we expect losses of usd 87 million to usd 107 million, which implies a reduction versus h1 of 5% to 22% and versus last year, a reduction of 12%, up to 29%. finally, we reiterate our yearly guidance for 2022 of usd 200 million to usd 220 million, and we expect adjusted ebitda loss to start decreasing on a yearly basis starting next year. the results of our clear strategy and consistent execution are coming nicely together, allowing us to reduce adjusted ebitda losses going forward.
and now jeremy and antoine will give more color on the results.
jeremy hodara -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thanks a lot, sacha. hello, everyone. i'll start with the progress on the first building block of our past profitability, the usage growth, and we are on page seven. usage growth is the result of coordinated efforts across all the areas of the business, and we've been working relentlessly across the platform to earn and to keep the trust and the loyalty of our customers.
we have outlined on the page recent examples of what we are doing on the marketing, commercial logistics and tech fronts to support the usage growth. on the marketing front, we are investing in both consumer adoption and retention, and we are seeing a very strong level of engagement on our platform. during the jumia anniversary campaign, our video content views reached a record of 116 million, up 55% year over year. this demonstrates our thorough understanding of what resonates with customers and our ability to produce engaging content for them.
on the commercial front, we offer consumers a wide range of relevant products and services with a particular focus on everyday categories. this is even more important in a challenging macro context where consumers can rotate away from higher-value discretionary items toward staples and everyday products. while we are seeing sustained volume growth across categories, fmcg was the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold in q2, up 95%. on the logistics side, we remain focused on improving the speed and the cost of our deliveries, offering our consumers even more convenience.
in q2, 60% of shipped packages reached consumers within 24 hours of placing the order. this is a great achievement considering the volume step-up we experienced as part of the jumia anniversary campaign. and last but not least, we are reaping the benefits of our sustained technology investments over the past year to enhance user interface and experience. this supported a 17% uplift in conversion rate year over year in the second quarter.
our consistent and disciplined execution on these four levers is driving the robust usage growth momentum you are seeing on page eight. on page eight, there is broad-based growth momentum across all reported usage metrics. quarterly active consumers reached 3.4 million, up 25% as we continue to acquire new consumers and improve the retention rate of existing ones. orders reached usd 10.3 million, up 35% driven by both new consumer adds and the increased purchase frequency of returning consumers.
these developments drove robust gmv growth despite material fx headwinds. gmv reached usd 271 million, up 21% year over year and 34% on a constant currency basis. and you will note that the fx headwinds to gmv are much larger in q2 than in q1 last quarter with 13 points of percentage adverse impact to gmv growth compared to 8 percentage points last quarter. we had 10 of our 11 local currencies depreciating against the dollar in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021.
in particular, the egyptian pound, the west african cfa franc, both depreciated by 10% against the dollar, while the naira in nigeria depreciated by 7%. notwithstanding the effect growth momentum in the business remain robust. we are driving not only robust but also high-quality growth with significant improvement in cohorts and repurchase dynamics, as you can see on the page nine. you've heard us talk in the past about the discipline with which we deploy consumer incentives and marketing investments with a focus on cohort quality.
you've also heard us talk about the importance of everyday product to support repurchase dynamics. this is now clearly demonstrated by the retention and purchase frequency data that you see on the page. the average 90-day repurchase rate of the new consumers acquired in q1 2022 reached 44%, up by over five points versus q1 last year. this is driving an uplift in purchase frequency with a number of quarterly orders per quarterly active consumers, increasing by 8% year over year, reaching over three orders in q2.
the strategic focus we placed on everyday product categories was an important driver of these improvements. on page 10, you can see the continued shift of our gmv toward everyday categories, which went from accounting for 57% of our gmv in q2 2020 to 66% in q2 2022. within the brackets of every categories, the lifestyle services, which include food delivery and jumiapay app service so their share in gmv doubled from 9% in q2 2020 to 18% in q2 2022. within the everyday physical good categories, the home and fashion categories remain consistently the largest two product categories, each commanding a mid to high-teens share of gmv.
average order value stood at usd 26.3 in q2 as we further penetrate more affordable, smaller ticket size categories. let's now move on to jumiapay starting with the tpv on page 12. jumia's tpv increased by 31% year over year and 45% on a constant currency basis, supported by the robust gmv growth. on-platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of gmv reached 27% in q2, up from 25% in q2 last year as we focused on increasing the penetration of jumiapay in a disciplined and gradual manner.
turning to transactions on page 13. jumiapay transactions reached 3.4 million in q2 this year, up 25% year over year, supported by accelerating volume growth across the business and in the food delivery category in particular. overall, 33% of orders placed on the jumia platform in q2 2022 were completed using jumiapay compared to 35% last year. the growth in jumiapay transactions in our e-commerce and food delivery platform outpaced the growth of jumiapay app transactions as jumiapay penetration is almost 100% on the jumiapay app, the reduced share of jumiapay app in the transaction mix led to a decline in the overall jumiapay transaction penetration as a percentage of orders.
overall, the growth momentum of jumiapay on platform remains very robust. jumiapay has been a tremendous driver of convenience and security for our consumers, while opening up a broad range of relevant digital services. starting from 2023, we expect jumiapay to turn into a monetization driver as we offer this solution to third-party merchants of platform. and now i'll hand over to antoine, who will walk you through our financial performance in more details.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thank you, jeremy. hello, everyone. i will start with the monetization performance, which speaks to our progress on the second building block of our path to profitability, monetization acceleration. let's first unpack revenue growth dynamics on page 15.
revenue reached usd 57.3 million in q2 '22, up 42% year over year and 56% on a constant currency basis. the largest contributor to revenue growth was first-party revenue, which increased by over 90% year on year, supported by the strong momentum in the fmcg and grocery set category in particular. the second observation i'd like to make here is that the new revenue streams such as value-added services and marketing and advertising are starting to have a material contribution to revenue growth. the combined contribution of value-added services and marketing and advertising to revenue growth surpassed the combined contributions of commissions and fulfillment revenue.
the growth across a broad range of revenue streams is allowing us to continue making growth investments in the form of consumer incentives, which were up by usd 3.6 million year on year in the second quarter. let's now dive deeper into the marketplace revenue trajectory on page 16. marketplace revenue posted its fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, up 17% year on year and 28% on a constant currency basis with a number of revenue streams reaching record levels. i'd like to reiterate the point i made on the prior slide, which is the diversification of revenue streams.
here, you see clearly the growing contribution to marketplace revenue from marketing and advertising and value-added services, which reached an all-time high in q2 at 41% of marketplace revenue compared to 33% a year ago. and this is the result of the very strong growth rates we've been driving across these two activities. marketing and advertising revenue reached an all-time high of usd 4.6 million surpassing the previous record rate in q4 '21, up 76% year on year, the fastest growth rate in over two years. this was supported by an acceleration in a number of campaign run, which was up by over 140% in q2 '22 versus q2 '21.
value-added services accelerated by 32%, partly as the result of increased logistics revenue from local and international sellers. on the flip side, fulfillment revenue reached usd 7.7 million down 7% year on year due to a broader deployment of the next day free delivery. this is a trend we are comfortable with as one, free next-day delivery in relevant areas is an important driver of convenience, supporting consumer adoption and repurchase. and we have built a strong and diversified monetization engine that makes us less reliant on consumer shipping fees.
last but not least, commissions revenue reached a six quarter at usd 10.6 million, surpassing the prior peak of q4 '21. this corresponds to a 13% year-on-year increase, supported by the robust gmv growth. this is net of consumer incentives. if we exclude the impact of consumer incentives, commissions revenue was up 21% year on year.
i'd like to point out here that the increase in commission revenue is yet to fully reflect the impact of commission increases, which were undertaken in may and june '22. we expect the impact of these increases to materialize in the second half of 2022. the strong marketplace revenue growth is driving an acceleration in gross profit growth. gross profit growth reached a five-quarter high at 14% year on year, supported by the robust growth in marketplace revenue.
on a constant currency basis, gross profit growth reached 24% year on year. we continue to invest into price competitiveness and free shipping with an increase in consumer incentive from usd 4.5 million in q2 '21 to usd 8.2 million in q2 '22. excluding the impact of consumer incentives, gross profit accelerated by 23% year on year and 36% in constant currency, while the margin as a percentage of gmv increased to 14.2%. while we have meaningfully accelerated monetization growth in q2, we are working on a number of initiatives that will allow us to drive even faster growth in the second half of '22.
we have outlined some of these initiatives on page 18. we are working across all revenue streams to drive either faster growth, enhanced margins are a combination of both. with respect to first-party activity, first-party revenue grew at an average north of 100% year on year over the past three quarters, thanks to strong volume growth in the fmcg and grocery category. this is allowing us to negotiate volume rebates with our suppliers, helping us expand our first-party gross profit margin.
within marketplace revenue, we are working on a number of levels to further accelerate growth and expand margins. on the commissions front, as mentioned earlier, we implemented commission increases in may and june '22, leveraging the robust volume growth experienced over the past year. we expect the full impact of these increases to reflect into the gross profit in the second half of '22. the value-added services revenue also has meaningful growth potential.
the deployment of next day free delivery and jumia express items for consumers is allowing us to better monetize the jumia express service that we provide to sellers, i.e., the sellers payers for the service. the revenue associated with jumia express is booked under value-added services. last but not least, we remain in very early days of marketing and advertising monetization on our platform. for advertisers looking to reach african consumers online with the purchase intent and drive measurable results, jumia is the advertising platform of choice.
we are leveraging this unique positioning to drive increased take-up of our ad solutions by our sellers and third-party advertisers. in addition, we are currently in the process of monetizing the assets of our platform, selectively allowing third-party participants to make use of them, starting with our logistics platform. 18 months into the launch of our logistics-as-a-service offering, we are now generating over usd 1 million in quarterly revenue from this activity. our offering solved the material pain point for companies across a broad range of industries.
we intend to leverage our position to further optimize our pricing and expand both revenue and margin from this activity. while we expect these various initiatives to drive sustained growth over many years to come, they will positively impact gross profit as early as the second half of '22. we expect gross profit of usd 75 million to usd 85 million in the second half of '22, implying year-on-year growth of 27% to 44%, and a sequential increase of 29% to 46%. i would like to point out here that our near-term guidance does not reflect any material contribution from off-platform payment processing activities of jumiapay, which are in the very old days of the development.
we intend to drive off-platform rollout in a very disciplined and gradual manner, and hence, we do not expect any relevant revenue contribution before '23. let's now move on to costs, starting with fulfillment expense on page 20. fulfillment expense reached usd 27.8 million, up 46% year on year and up 62% on a constant currency basis. this trajectory is driven by robust volume growth and high inflationary pressures.
with respect to volume growth drivers, fulfillment expense includes both the costs associated with our e-commerce orders and logistics-as-a-service packages. the former reached usd 10.3 million, up 35% year on year, while the latter more than doubled year on year to usd 2.6 million. with respect to input cost inflation. as you know, fuel costs increased significantly over the past few months.
the cost of packaging also went up, and there is obviously wage inflation. in this context, we are working on a number of initiatives to mitigate the impact of inflation, ranging from scale efficiencies to drive trade and shipping cost savings to productivity enhancement in our warehouses to reduce ending -- end packaging costs. moving on to sales and advertising expense on page 21. after a period of marketing investment ramp-up that started in june '21, we are now stabilizing the level of investment.
sales and advertising reached usd 22.2 million in q2 '22, and the year on year growth rate decreased from 115% in q2 '21 to 30% in q2 '22. you will note here that the effect impact is more moderated on sales and advertising expense compared to other lines of our p&l with only 6% points. that's because a large part of our sales and advertising expenses denominated in usd corresponding to online marketing costs, including search and social media cost. our h1 '22 sales and advertising expense came in lower than expected at usd 41 million compared to our guidance of usd 50 million to usd 55 million.
resilient usage growth allowed us to remain very disciplined and stand lower than expected in marketing. building on that, we intend to drive more marketing efficiencies in the second half of '22. we expect sales and advertising of usd 35 million to usd 45 million in h2 '22, implying a year-on-year decline of 18% to 37%. moving on to technology and g&a cost on page 22.
technology continues to be an important area of investment for us to support the long-term growth of our business both on the e-commerce and payment front. technology expense reached usd 14.3 million in q2 '22, up 70% year on year and 80% on a constant currency basis. this is largely a result of headcount increases completed in the second half of '21. on a sequential basis, the technology expense increase was much more moderate than 10% quarter-on-quarter.
g&a, excluding share-based compensation, reached usd 26.6 million in q2 '22, flat year on year, and up 11% on constant-currency basis. on a sequential basis, g&a, excluding share-based compensation, was down 12%, mostly as the result of local tax efficiencies. we remain very disciplined when it comes to g&a overhead cost in particular. we are currently on a hiring phase, which is driving headcount decreases since we are not replacing leaders.
this will allow us to keep g&a cost base relatively stable going forward. i want to make an important distinction here. the height of the pandemic, i.e., '20 and '21 was not a period of capacity expansion and g&a cost of rent for us, quite the opposite. g&a, excluding share-based compensation, was usd 120 million in '19, and we bought it down by 11% to usd 107 million in 2020 and kept it stable in 21 at usd 108 million.
we have already done a fair amount of work to rightsize our g&a cost base, but we will continue further optimizing our organizational structure and cost base. turning to adjusted ebitda loss on page 23. adjusted ebitda loss reached usd 57.2 million in q2 '22, demonstrating that we are past the peak of adjusted ebitda losses that was reached in q4 '21. adjusted ebitda loss in q2 '22 was up 37% year on year, and 49% on a constant currency basis.
this is a clear deceleration compared to q1 '22, where adjusted ebitda loss was up 70% year on year. for the second half of '22, we intend to start reducing adjusted ebitda loss on a year-on-year basis. we expect h2 '22 adjusted ebitda loss of usd 87.4 billion to usd 107.4 million. this implies a year-on-year reduction of 12% to 29% year on year.
let's now move on to balance sheet and cash flow items on page 24. capex in q1 '22 was usd 3.7 million mostly relating to technology equipment purchases. we are reducing our full year '22 capex guidance from usd 15 million to usd 25 million to usd 10 million to usd 15 million as we are slowing down the phasing of logistics capacity expansion. net change in working capital had a neutral impact quarter as an increase in trade payables related to the jumia anniversary campaign was offset by increases in trade receivable and inventory.
cash utilization for the quarter was usd 63.7 million with the main difference versus adjusted ebitda losses relating to capex and cash adjustment from provisions. at the end of march 22, we had a liquidity position of usd 351 million comprised of usd 54 million of cash and cash equivalents and usd 297 million of short-term deposits and other financial assets. with that, i'll hand over to sacha for concluding remarks.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
thank you, jeremy. thank you, antoine. i think we have clearly made very good progress over the first half of this year, delivering very strongly on each building block of our path to profitability. we have very strong momentum to double down on those profitability efforts.
gmv growth in h1 was the highest in the past two years. last year, in the same q2 earnings call, we promised to the market that we will accelerate usage growth, and that's exactly what we did. looking ahead, we intend to maintain growth, and we have reiterated our guidance. in q2, marketplace revenue growth was the highest of the past seven quarters.
gross profit growth was the highest of the past five quarters. and in h2 of this year, we intend to double if not triple the growth rate of gross profit to reach 27% to 44%. importantly, we expect to drive the growth of the usage and the acceleration of the monetization with strong cost discipline, in particular, for h2, higher marketing efficiency. you've already seen the pace of our sales and advertising investments slowed down sequentially in the first half of this year.
for the second half, we intend to reduce sales and advertising by 18% to 37%. we are also working, of course, on initiatives to drive efficiencies across the full cost structure. on fulfillment, we are focused on generating scale efficiencies and productivity enhancements to mitigate the impact of inflation. we also remain very disciplined on the g&a front.
you have seen our g&a expense, excluding share-based compensation come down over the past two quarters, and we intend to maintain the discipline. as a result, we expect adjusted ebitda loss year over year starting to reduce in the second half of this year. and beyond that, we expect the loss to decline on a yearly basis starting next year. we are very much aware of the increased market focus on profitability.
our strategy and business execution are very much aligned with that. i think our performance and the guidance we have provided speak clearly to that. importantly, there is no disconnect here between the near-term profitability objectives and the long-term attractiveness and strength of our platform as we pursue our scale and profitability objectives, we are building an even more attractive and relevant platform for our consumers, as well as win-win partnerships with our sellers and broader ecosystem participants. thank you for your attention, and we are now ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is coming from aaron kessler with raymond james. please go ahead.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. a couple of questions. first, maybe just if you can talk about kind of the plan to further drive the kind of gross profit less incentive growth over the next several quarters and maybe specific to incentives kind of how should we think about payments going forward as well? second, increase on the marketing revenues, i think as you highlighted, if you have any more color around that, should we think about this increase is pretty sustainable going forward as well, kind of change on marketing revenue? and maybe third, just commission increase, can you just quantify kind of how much that is as a percentage?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
i think maybe it was me that you were breaking a little bit, so i'll try to answer, but if i'm off topic, please let me know, right? the first question is on the gross profit and the incentive part, right?
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
yes, gross profit less fulfillment and your plans to expand that? and second part of that question is announced.
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
so the first one is on the gross profit, aaron? or on the gross profit and particularly do you want to hear about the incentives?
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
yes, gross profit minus fulfillment kind of plans to expand that amount over time?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
yes. yes. so look, i think on this one, i think we give a bit less guidance than on the gross profit because there is a lot of unknowns on the fulfillment efficiencies and the inflation that is underlying, right? so that's why we give guidance on the gross profit for h2. and it's a bit harder for us to give a guidance on the gross profit after fulfillment because this -- the fulfillment right now is a lot impacted by inflation.
of course, as we said, we have a lot of initiatives to drive efficiencies and savings on fulfillment, but it's harder, i would say, to predict definitely in order to drive the ebitda reduction or the loss reduction that we aim for h2, we want to expand the gross profit after fulfillment, right? and that's our objective. and we have not given a precise guidance over that because of the nature of fulfillment efficiencies at the moment. but definitely, we want to drive that forward. now, advertising revenues as we said and we are still, we believe, in the early days, to some extent of this revenue stream and we have a very big addition for those in the long term.
we think that we have a very unique value proposition for both the big brands and the big sellers. we have also a lot of smaller sellers who are using our solutions of sponsored ads and sponsored products. and then, we have also a lot of third-party advertisers who will come to jumia in order to reach consumers. and this revenue stream being in the early days and also being, to some extent, dependent on our campaigns.
i think you see that over time, there's been some volatility. so there's going to be some fluctuation of growth over time, but we believe that overall, it's one of the revenue streams, which is in the midterm going to grow very well and very fast, right? so there will be fluctuation. as you know, you've seen the last -- if you look at the few quarters in 2021, of course, q4 was much bigger because of black friday, right? and so here, we'll see in q3, q4. but generally speaking, this is one that we intend to grow fast, and we believe we're still in the early days of this one.
and then, commission increases, we are very careful about that. so we have passed on increases, and we're going to keep doing that. at the same time, we want to do that in a very thoughtful way because as the marketplace, of course, the commission level is very important for the sellers. and we want to do that in a thoughtful way, and i would say, almost in partnerships with sellers, right? so we're going to, i think, continue to see some commission growth driven by the volume growth and the commission increase that we are passing but we want to do that in a thoughtful way.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. great. well, thank you.

our next question is coming from lamont williams with stifel. please go ahead.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. the first question i have is on what are you seeing in your consumer base as a result of the macro, are you seeing trade down for your orders, anything you can point to there? and what is your guidance contemplating from a macro standpoint going for the back half of the year and into '23?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
look, i think -- it's a big question. i wish i would know what's going to happen, right? i think -- what we're seeing in terms of consumer, and i would say i'm going to speak on the sellers because both are impacted by the macro, right? so, of course, the consumers are impacted by the inflation across the board and in particular, commodity and food prices. the consumer sentiment is under pressure and the spending is under pressure. on the seller side, the sellers are also under pressure because of weaker local currencies, right? and a lot of the sellers depend on access to hard currencies in order to trade, in order to import, in order to operate.
and so, we see also some sellers struggling with access to supply and ability to import products or to even just go into production, right? so we see that at the time i mean, i don't want to make it sound like nothing is happening, but challenging macro for us is nothing new. it's something that we have been exposed pretty much from day one, and we are used to navigating periods of high volatility, hyperinflation. and in the past, we have sometimes fared better than other channels in period of hyperinflation or increased consumer price sensitivity because at the end of the day, we have a lot of competitive advantages to appeal to the consumers. we have price transparency.
we have a very healthy marketplace flywheel, where the consumers can benefit from multiple sellers competing together. we have the ability to offer also the 1p where we can decide to price ourselves and intervene, if you will, on the market. and we have access also to cross-border channels. we have a very attractive base of sellers in china that we can work with when we see gaps of supply and gaps in certain categories.
so i think what we are seeing now and what we've seen in q2 and what we're seeing and what we're saying for h2 is that we're going to keep growing. and we're going to keep growing while accelerating monetization and savings and marketing. so i think we are quite confident. we are quite confident that despite the macro people can trade down, so as long as they need to buy products, they will come to jumia and they will look for options, and we will be well positioned.
so i think the guidance we give on keeping growing in the context of macro challenges and savings and investments of marketing, combined with monetization, i think it's a very strong sign of confidence.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
our next question is coming from catherine o'neill with citi. please go ahead.
catherine o'neill -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you. my first question is on the jumiapay monetization potential. could you provide a bit more detail on how you're thinking about the monetization plan and the timing of launches of different products and services and how meaningful that could be for 2023? secondly, on sort of advertising and marketing spend and incentives.
i guess you're fairly comfortable that when you cut sales and marketing spend as you plan to year on year that that won't detrimentally impact the growth? and on the other side, how should we think about the incentives going into the second half? and then finally on capex. i know you've taken down your capex guidance for this year. is that sort of a permanent reduction or are you pushing some of that capex spend out into 2023?
sacha poignonnec -- co-founder and co-chief executive officer
jumiapay monetization for us is a very big strategic priority that we are -- as you mentioned, undertaking at the moment, right? so in the past couple of quarters, we obtained our licenses to offer merchant payment processing services in nigeria and egypt, which is great because those are two largest markets, right? and we have been, over the last few months preparing the launch and starting to pilot it, right? so we are actually lives in egypt with a number of pilot merchants, and we are about to go live in nigeria with some pilot merchants. and we were operating jumiapay only for our platform. and so, we are undertaking a number of changes and adaptations in order to operate for third-party merchants and creating features and product specificities, which work for that. and it's a bit too soon for us to give guidance in terms of how much revenue we expect, etc., in 2023.
but it's already live. it's something that -- the first step for us was to obtain the license, which is a very big achievement. the second step was to adapt the product and start piloting it, which is ongoing. and the third step will be to sell it, right? so i think probably in the coming maybe one or two quarters, we'll be able to give an update on the pilot, and then probably more precise guidance.
but again, we don't expect revenues yet this year. probably next year. how much? is a bit too soon to tell. we are also, of course, looking at more countries to be in a position to offer those services in the other countries.
and i think we are very uniquely positioned to offer payment processing services because jumiapay has been processing the payments for jumia after all. and we believe we're one of the biggest merchants online. and so, we believe that jumiapay is very, very attractive and providing a very good service for merchants. and we know it because it's providing the service to jumia.
so we look forward to updating you on this as soon as we can. in terms of consumer incentives and sales and advertising. you are right that we want to drive that very meaningfully and very carefully or very thoughtfully, i should say. and we certainly want to continue to invest and to continue to support the consumer adoption and the consumer loyalty, and we want to continue to see some growth of the usage.
and so, i think here, those levels of sale advertising and consumer incentives, they are, to some extent, discretionary, right? so we decide what we think is the right amount to invest based on what we think is the best return that we can get and the best output that we can get in terms of consumer uptake and so on. and i think we feel good with this level for h2. we change and we can change those on a dynamic basis. i think you see the strength of the brand.
you see the strength of the cohorts that we have disclosed and brought you some numbers during this quarter. you see the strength of the value proposition in terms of assortment and delivery. so we believe that the amount for h2 are appropriate and will lead to continued growth and in a good and healthy way. we are able to accelerate or to decelerate if we see that we can or we need to.
so now we believe that this is the right amount. and then, in terms of capex, i think, to some extent, those capex -- i mean, all of those capex are in local currency, right? so i think here, some of that the reduced guidance -- some of the reduced guidance is due to the fact that in dollar terms, we can invest less and we get the same in local terms. i think it's more something that it's not a permanent reduction. you have seen, we are generally asset light, and we are generally low capex.
and so, i think it's not a permanent reduction. it's something that we assess all the time. and those capex are mainly about fulfillment centers, equipment and certain new locations that we decide to upgrade for our sellers to do drop off and so on and so forth. and so, we are generally very flexible with that.
and we can reassess capex almost as we need. and we believe that certainly, we want to stay asset-light in the future and keep that flexibility.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by. welcome to jumia's results conference call for the third quarter of 2022. [operator instructions] after management's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
i would now like to turn the call over to safae damir, head of investor relations for jumia. please go ahead.
safae damir -- head of investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. with us today are francis dufay, acting ceo of jumia; and antoine maillet-mezeray, executive vice president, finance and operations.
as previously announced, a new management board and acting ceo have been appointed while jeremy hodara and sacha poignonnec have stepped down from their co-ceo role. the supervisory board has appointed francis and antoine as members of the company's management board. francis, our acting ceo, has been with the company since 2014 and has held multiple senior leadership roles, including ceo of ivory coast. he was recently executive vice president africa, with responsibility for the group's e-commerce business across africa.
francis has a track record of successfully scaling e-commerce operations in africa, with a strong focus on profitability. he has been based in ivory coast since 2014 and is an ivorian national. he brings a deep understanding of our business and the markets that we operate in. antoine, whom you know, was previously group cfo and has now been elevated to executive vice president, finance and operations.
antoine has been with jumia for over six years and played a very important role in the organization. his expanded areas of responsibility will, no doubt, benefit from his expertise and deep knowledge of the business. let me now cover the safe harbor. we would like to remind you that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements.
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. moreover, these forward-looking statements may speak only to our expectations as of today. we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. for a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements expressed today, please see the risk factors section of our annual report on form 20-f as published on april 29, 2022, as well as our other submissions with the sec.
in addition, on this call, we will refer to certain financial measures not reported in accordance with ifrs. you can find reconciliations of these non-ifrs financial measures with the corresponding ifrs financial measures in our earnings press release, which is available on our investor relations website. with that, i'll hand it over to francis. 
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
thank you, safae. welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. on this call, we will walk you through our q3 performance and provide you with an overview of our strategy to take the business to profitability. while the results of the third quarter show some progress toward breakeven, we want to make even more meaningful progress and further reduce our cash utilization.
adjusted ebitda loss reached its lowest level in five quarters at $45.5 million, down 13% year over year. adjusted ebitda loss as a percentage of gmv dropped below 20% at 18.9% of gmv. the reduction in adjusted ebitda loss was driven by a strong increase in gross profit, which was up 29% year on year; and a significant reduction in sales and advertising expense, which was down 32% over the same period. this is very much in line with what had been communicated to the markets earlier this year, which is an acceleration in monetization, coupled with cost reduction.
if the results and progress i'm creating begs the question why we need to rewrite strategy to take the business to profitability. the answer is that we are confident that we can do much better across a number of areas, and this will help us make even more meaningful progress toward profitability. we want to drive sharper execution, which is even more critical in the context of a challenging macroeconomic environment. we have outlined on page 6 the highlights of our strategy.
here, we recognize the strategic drivers of our path to profitability: usage growth, cost discipline, monetization, and the continued development of jumiapay. and that's not a price, to restore stability, we need a larger scale, more revenue, and a much more efficient cost structure. however, this is all about the details of execution. what levers to pull to drive growth in a sustainable manner? where to cut costs in a way that doesn't affect our long-term growth? and how to monetize while adding value to the sellers? and this, we believe, requires two things.
one is a deep knowledge of the market dynamics and operations on the ground in our markets. and two, obviously, focus and discipline. on the first point, the execution details of our strategy are well-rooted in deep knowledge of the operations and the market. we use the learnings from our 11 markets and many case studies of success to inform the strategy.
the execution of this strategy happens on the ground in africa. that's why we have taken very swift action over the last week, significantly reducing our presence in dubai and relocating most of the group leadership to africa. on the second point, we need much more focus in terms of scope of projects and the activities that we undertake. we cannot be sharp in our execution if we are spreading ourselves too thin across too many projects.
we need to stop projects that bring limited value to the platform and focus on what matters. and again, to know which projects matter the most, we need to be on the ground with much closer feedback loops with the markets. so, before providing you with more details on strategy, i will pass it on to antoine, who will walk you through the q3 performance. thank you.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
thanks, francis. hello, everyone. i'll start with the operating performance and kpis of e-commerce and jumiapay before moving on to commentary on financial metrics. in terms of e-commerce dynamics, we sustained growth across all relevant usage kpis despite more challenging macroenvironment.
quarterly active consumers reached 3.1 million, a 3% year on year, as we continue to acquire new consumers and grow the base of returning consumers. orders reached 9.4 million, up 11% year on year, with sustained volume growth across product categories, with the exception of jumiapay app digital services, where we scaled back marketing investments and incentives to support unit economics. the fastest growing category in all terms was food delivery, which continues to exhibit strong momentum with orders up 38% year on year. food delivery remains a core aspect of our consumer value proposition, and we will continue driving its development across our largest markets and in nigeria, in particular.
gmv reached $240.7 million usd, up 1% year on year and up 14% on a constant currency basis. fx was a material headwind to gmv performance in the second quarter of 2022, with all local currencies depreciating against the usd. in particular, during the nine months period ending september 30, 2022, compared to the same period of 2021, nigerian naira, egyptian pound, and west african cfa depreciated by 5%, 14%, and 13%, respectively, against the dollar. in terms of category trends, we started to see a stabilization of the gmv category mix.
phones and electronics accounted for 36% of gmv in q3 '22, in line with their contribution in q3 '21. the fastest growing category in gmv terms was food delivery, up 25% year on year, supported by the strong volume growth in this category. while usage growth held up in q3, we observed the softening of usage growth trends as we moved toward the end of the quarter due to a deteriorating macroenvironment. the combination of inflation in commodity and food prices, alongside a stronger dollar and weaker local currencies, is weighing on consumer spend and sentiment.
it also makes it more challenging for all our sellers to serve goods, particularly for those more exposed to imports. with that in mind, we took the decision to suspend the gmv growth guidance for the full year. we will come back to that at the end of this section. let's now turn to jumiapay operating metrics.
tpv reached $66.6 million usd, up 3% year on year and 16% on constant currency basis. this was supported by the strong growth in both gmv and tpv on our food delivery platform. on-platform penetration of jumiapay as a percentage of gmv remained stable at 28% in q3 '22, versus 27% in q3 '21 as we maintain a disciplined marketing approach to driving on-platform penetration. jumiapay transactions reached 3 million in q3 '22, down 1% year on year, impacted by softer transactions performance in the jumiapay app as we scale that marketing investment and promotional intensity in the app.
overall, 32% of orders placed on the jumia platform in q3 '22 were completed using jumiapay, compared to 36% in q3 '21. as jumiapay penetration is almost 100% on the jumiapay app, the reduced share of jumiapay app in the transactions mix led to a decline in the overall jumiapay transactions penetration as a percentage of orders. jumiapay remains a core part of our platform, and we intend to continue driving its development, both on and off platform, in a very disciplined manner. let's now move on to financials, starting with revenue.
revenue reached $50.5 million usd, up 18% year on year and up 33% on a constant currency basis. this was driven by strong momentum in market-based revenue, which was up 27% year on year and 41% on a constant currency basis. first-party revenue growth was softer, up 2% year on year and 17% on a constant currency basis as we undertook less business on the first-party basis compared to q3 '21. we retain an opportunistic approach to our first-party activity.
the aim is to bridge gaps in assortment on our platform on an ad-hoc basis. we intend to enhance first-party business margins by improving the processes and systems in this business and reducing business complexities by scaling back the fmcg category in certain countries. other revenue was up 53% year on year and 69% on a constant currency basis, partly due to the momentum of our logistics-as-a-service offering, which generated about $1 million usd of revenue during the quarter. let's now unpack the growth dynamics of our marketplace revenue.
marketplace revenue reached $32.2 million usd in q3 '22, posting its fastest year-on-year growth rate in nine quarters. two-thirds of the marketplace revenue growth came from commissions, which reached an all-time high of $12.6 million usd, up 56% year on year, driven by commission take rate increases implemented over the past couple of quarters. value-added services were the second largest source of market-based revenue at $8.4 million usd, up 32% year on year. this was a result of increased logistics revenue from local and international sellers due to increased pricing of services.
on the flip side, fulfillment revenue, which includes shipping fees charged to consumers, reached $7.9 million usd, down 11% year on year as a result of the selective deployment of next-day free delivery. we are currently making adjustments to the free shipping program, introducing higher minimum basket size and further restricting geographical scope to support our unit economics. last but not least, marketing and advertising was our fastest-growing revenue streams, up 64% year on year, reaching $3.3 million usd. this was the result of our sustained effort to enhance the value proposition of our ad solutions for sellers and third-party advertisers.
the accelerating market-based revenue growth drove strong gross profit growth, which was up 29% year on year and 43% on a constant currency basis, reaching $33 million usd. and gross profit margin as a percentage of gmv reached an all-time high of 13.7%. moving on to cost, starting with fulfillment expense, which reached $23.6 million usd, up 7% year on year and 22% on a constant currency basis. this was a result of volume growth, with orders up 11% during this period, but also inflationary pressure on fuel and wages.
while we expect continued inflationary pressure and discuss line in the near term, we intend to improve fulfillment economics in the near term by driving skill efficiencies and enhancing productivity in our physical infrastructure. sales and advertising expense was $16.4 million usd, down 32% year on year and 28% on a constant currency basis as we brought more discipline to our marketing investment. this led to an improvement of marketing efficiency ratios, with sales and the advertising expense per order decreasing by 38%, from $2.8 to $1.7 per order. sales and advertising expense as a percentage of gmv decreased to 6.8%, which was a 325-basis-point improvement year on year.
while this progress is encouraging, we intend to drive even further marketing efficiencies by improving the relevance and cost-efficient effectiveness of our marketing channels. let's now turn to tech and g&a costs, starting with tech and content expense, which reached 13.6 million, up 44% year on year and 56% on a constant currency basis. this was mostly due to technology staff costs increases due to headcount increases completed in h2 last year. that said, we have been much more disciplined on the headcount front over the past few months.
we drove a decline in technology staff cost in the sequential basis, which explains the 5% decline in tech between the second and third quarters of this year. g&a, excluding share-based compensation, reached $28.3 million usd, up 12% year on year and 22% on a constant currency basis. this was mostly a result of staff cost increases on a year-on-year basis. that being said, the hiring freezes implemented earlier this year started paying off as the staff cost component of g&a, excluding share-based compensation, declined by over 6% on a sequential basis in q3 '22.
we intend to drive even more staff cost savings and are implementing headcount reduction across a number of areas in business to create a leaner and more agile organization. to wrap up on cost, we have made good progress in the sales and advertising front and increased staff cost discipline is starting to pay off. that said, we do have room to take even more decisive action across cost lines to drive through their efficiencies, and we have a clear action plan to achieve that. let's now move on to balance sheet and cash flow items.
capex in q3 '22 was $3 million usd, mostly relating to logistics and technology equipment purchases. net change in working cap at a notable impact of $13.1 million usd, largely as a result of a significant decrease in trade payables corresponding to the payment of jumia anniversary campaign invoices during q3 '22. cash utilization for the quarter was 62.2 million, which is a 5% decline compared to q2 '22. at the end of september '22, we had a liquidity position of $285 million usd, comprised of 104 million of cash and cash equivalents and $180 million usd of term deposits and other financial assets.
i conclude my part with a review of our guidance. as mentioned earlier, in the light of the highly volatile and unpredictable macroenvironment, we have decided to suspend the full year 2022 gmv growth guidance, as well as gross profit guidance for h2 '22, which is linked to gmv. that said, we reiterate our guidance for all the other metrics that we guided on earlier this year. we continue to expect to spend between 35 million and 45 million in terms of advertising in h2 '22.
this implies sales and advertising expense of 19 million to 29 million in q4 '22. for the full year 2022, we continue to expect an adjusted ebitda loss of $200 million usd to $220 million usd. this implies adjusted ebitda loss of 42 million to 62 million in q4 '22. for the full year 2023, we expect adjusted ebitda loss to be lower than for the full year 2022.
we will be providing quantitative guidance for that as part of our q4 '22 earnings release. lastly, we reiterate our capex guidance for the full year of 2022 of $10 million usd to $15 million usd. with that, i'll hand it over to francis for an overview of our strategic plan.
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
thanks, antoine. we are committed to making meaningful progress toward profitabilities. we have a clear plan to get there and have already made significant management changes to ensure that we have the best teams to execute on this strategy. and we start with the first level of strategy, which is enhanced business focus.
this is an overarching principle of our strategy that will guide execution across all areas of the business. we intend to do less and better. we plan to allocate our resources and teams to projects that bring proven value to our platform and the broader ecosystem. this means that we will be pausing or stopping projects that do not meet those criteria.
here are some examples. first, we plan to discontinue jumia prime. over the past couple of years, we tested the concept of a monthly subscription program offering free delivery to consumers. the results from this experiment in terms of consumer traction and stickiness fell short of all targets as the market is probably too early in terms of adoption curve.
that's why we're now stopping this initiative. this is an example of how we plan to draw reality conclusions in a timely manner from the experiments we do. we aim to assess within a reasonable time frame whether a pilot is successful or not and take action accordingly to avoid committing resources for too long to projects that do not work. in addition, we're suspending logistics-as-a-services to our e-commerce client in several countries.
we believe management efforts in many countries will be better invested in improving the logistics efficiency for the core e-commerce business. however, we will continue developing this activity in countries such as nigeria, morocco, and ivory coast, where the proof of concept for this service has already been established and where we are able to allocate the right resources. we are also scaling back our first-party grocery e-commerce in geographies where the category remains subscale in order to support our unit economics. grocery can be a very relevant category for more advanced markets with sufficient [inaudible] efficiency.
in smaller markets, it has added significant operational complexity without providing much upside in terms of consumer adoption and stickiness. the priority is to master the basics in the smaller markets, hence our decision to discontinue first-party grocery there. those two examples of first-party grocery and logistics-as-a-service are representative of how we intend to drive execution in a more nuanced manner by geography. it is difficult to push projects uniformly across all markets given the differences in scale and development of our platform.
we need to do what's right for each market given stage of development, and sometimes this means just focusing on the basics. what i have just covered here is a non-exhaustive list of discontinued or amended projects that we'll be constantly reviewing to optimize our capital and resource allocation. moving on to the second level of our strategy: driving sustainable long-term growth through enhanced e-commerce fundamentals. historically, usage growth was mostly fueled by higher promotional intensity and marketing spend, which led to a deterioration of unit economics in phases of growth acceleration.
we are confident that we can simultaneously improve our economics and support long-term growth by working on the core e-commerce fundamentals. how will that translate in terms of action? mastering the e-commerce basics of selection, price, and convenience across all geographies. one of our first priorities is to offer customers the best selection with sufficient stock at the best prices in each one of our core categories. we're at a very early stage of e-commerce development in africa, and shifting relevant and sufficient supply online can sometimes be challenging.
we have a clear action plan to address that, with a focus on core categories. we mean by core categories the bread and butter categories of the platform. these are phones and consumer electronics, home appliances, fashion, and beauty. for these categories, we are developing stronger relationships with brands and local distributors to secure supply and get better prices.
last but not least, we have room to further improve customer experience and further embed a mindset of customer centricity within the organization. we plan to continue investing in our technology backbone, though in a more disciplined manner, to make our platform even easier to use and more engaging for customers. to conclude on the usage front, we are taking a fundamental-led approach to usage growth. marketing and consumer incentives are very important, and there's a place for that in our strategy.
but marketing cannot compensate for gaps in fundamentals like product supply. we have to address these first. let's now move on to cost discipline. we intend to take more decisive action on the cost front to drive efficiencies across the full cost structure.
it is, of course, easy to cut marketing and consumer incentives budgets. it is much harder to open the box on each and every cost line and ensure that we are operating at the best level of efficiency across each one. and this is what we plan to do. on the logistics side, for example, we intend to work on each of cost components.
we plan to optimize our freight and shipping costs by launching tight negotiations with our third-party partners to ensure we are getting the best prices on each logistic group. we are -- within our physical infrastructure, we intend to increase staff productivity by enhancing our processes while working on consumable costs, such as reducing the use of packaging. we will also take a more disciplined approach to product category development, scaling back in product categories with challenging fulfillment economics such as groceries that we just explained. on the marketing front, we intend to improve marketing efficiency by leveraging best practices from countries with the best efficiency ratios.
we have made some progress in improving marketing efficiency, bringing it down to $1.7 per order and 6.8% of gmv. that said, we have countries with much better marketing efficiency ratios, and there are important lessons to learn from these markets. with that in mind, we intend to focus our spend on the marketing channels that drive the best returns on investments. we will also put more focus on local marketing channels, including above-the-line education and activation initiatives.
it will allow us to shift a higher share of marketing expense into local currencies while adopting an approach tailored to our markets. with respect to technology, we plan to continue investing in our technology backbone, but we intend to do so with more discipline, prioritizing our development road map on products and features that deliver immediate benefits in terms of units for consumers and for sellers. last but not least, g&a. we started seeing some progress from the hiring freeze implemented earlier this year with staff cost coming down by 6% in q3 compared to q2.
we intend to drive more staff cost savings and reduce headcount. we have taken steps to significantly reduce overhead expenses in dubai with meaningful g&a savings for the group and long-term benefits from locating decision centers back to africa. to conclude on the cost discipline topic, we intend to work with a very granular manner across the full cost structure and take very deliberate action to cut costs. let's now turn to monetization, where we will continue to adhere to a balanced approach to drive growth across multiple revenue streams.
we have made good progress on monetization in q3, with gross profit accelerating by 29% and gross profit as a percentage of gmv reaching an all-time high at 13.7%. however, we are being more cautious with the level of monetization pressure we apply on sellers as we also need to improve fundamentals of product assortment, supply, and prices. this means that in the near term, we do not intend to implement any meaningful take rate increases. on the other hand, we will continue developing services that bring value to our sellers and broader ecosystem participants such as advertising.
to conclude on monetization, we look at monetization very much as a byproduct of scale and are focused on driving growth and value for sellers in order to monetize. let's now move on to jumiapay. the development of jumiapay on and off platform remains a priority for us. and here, again, the overarching principle of business focus and discipline applies.
we will work on making it a strong enabler for economic business, focusing on a more targeted number of products and ventures. we will retain the disciplined approach to driving on-platform payment penetration with disciplined marketing spend and consumer incentives. lastly, we continue to be focused on expanding our off-platform payment processing solution in nigeria and egypt, where we have previously obtained the relevant licenses to do so. to conclude, the strategy that i've just outlined remains consistent with our calculus.
the important change is that it addresses, at the same time, profitability and growth with a greater sense of urgency and a concrete road map of decisive actions. i would like to emphasize that the current macro volatility does not affect, in any way, our very positive long-term outlook for africa. africa remains the last frontier for e-commerce in the world, with very attractive demographic and digitization dynamics. i have spent the last decade with jumia developing e-commerce on the ground in western africa.
i know firsthand the challenges of operating in our markets and successfully balancing growth and profitability. but i also know firsthand that we have great brands, a very strong platform, and incredibly talented and dedicated teams. i am very confident that we can build a large and profitable e-commerce platform in africa. with that, we are ready to take your questions.

ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] your first question for today is coming from aaron kessler at raymond james.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks for the questions. a couple of questions. first, just any way to size the gmv impact from scaling back some of these initiatives that you talked about? second, i think you talked about kind of excessive commission rate increases in the release.
can you -- relevant more details around that? and it sounds like you're slowing that increase going forward, but any impact on gmv you felt in the quarter from the higher commission rates as well? then i have a follow-up question.
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
ok, let me answer the first two and i ask [inaudible] on this. on gmv effect from scaling back a couple of initiatives, when we assess the initiative as a function of benefits versus costs and basically redoing business, we believe that we can scale back some initiatives without meaningfully harming our top line. we believe that refocusing, that having our teams focus on a shorter number of projects, depending on geographies, will enable them to deliver greater impact on other topics. that's basically the whole point of refocusing on basics.
so, we believe the total outcome for the business will be positive. when it comes to commissions increase, so our point here is very much that we need to create value for the vendors and all the sellers on the platform. what drives that is that vendors need to see the value and the benefit from working with jumia. and we very much see monetization in the future as a byproduct of scale.
so, scaling with vendor, solving the pain points will enable us to monetize. that they create pressure needs to be monitored very carefully as one of our core pillar -- core groups now is focused on supply. we very much want to build supply -- strong supply on the set of core categories, and we don't want too high take rates to come in the way. so, this is why we plan to be relatively careful with this regard.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and finally, just in terms of operating expenses, where do you think are the biggest areas for leverage or cash flow reductions going forward? is it g&a or something else?
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
so, i mean, as we said, we're really going down to whole p&l and we're opening the box on every type of cost that we have across the structure. so, we, of course, are looking at g&a, which is possibly one of the most short-term impacts. we are already redoing our central structural -- headquarters structure in dubai with meaningful impact, and we plan to locate most of the leadership toward africa and streamlining our governance and leadership structure across all countries. that's one.
but we also believe that we -- i mean, we're actually quite sure that we have meaningful impact to capture from logistics efficiency. you see that -- you see the evolution of costs that we posted this quarter. i would not say that we're super happy with the trend, and we believe that we can do better. we can capture a lot of efficiencies with many detailed measures across our business lines.
one very simple and basic example is our use of packaging material. this vary a lot across different countries, and we intend to plan many countries toward the best benchmark that we have. that was for logistics. we can also generate significant savings on [inaudible] where we also have countries that show better practices that are rich and so we can learn from those countries to drive way greater efficiency.
so, we do really believe that we have efficiency and cost-cutting structure pretty much across the board, and we're confident that we can achieve that with the team and the plan that we have.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question for today is coming from catherine o'neill at citi.
catherine o'neill -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you. i just want to ask you if you could comment in a bit more detail on one of the things you mentioned in the release about seeing softer usage trend toward the back of the third quarter, which you expect to persist in the fourth quarter. could you maybe just provide a bit more detail on what you're seeing, if that varies by market, and how much you saw that sort of deteriorate as we went through the third quarter? the other thing i wanted to ask about was the product mix.
i think you said you're moving away from fmcg. i may have misheard that. but you seem to be sort of emphasizing consumer electronics, fashion, beauty, etc. so, how should we think about the sort of take rate or margins if you're moving perhaps toward -- back toward consumer electronics, which tend to be sort of lower take rate? and then the one thing i want to talk about with the cash burn, so it looks like it was similar in 3q and 2q about 70 million each quarter.
i just wondered if you could give us any sort of idea on when you think this should start to reduce -- when these initiatives start to kick in on the cash side?
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
ok. so, let me -- hi, catherine. let me take the first two questions and then pass on to antoine [inaudible] regarding soft usage trend that you mentioned, well, you see that in the quarterly reports. we see 1% gmv growth year on year over the quarter.
so, you can -- i mean, i guess everyone can draw their own conclusions about what softening means here. but obviously, we've been dealing with volatile and difficult macroeconomic context, significant local currency depreciation and volatility, which led particularly -- and this is a great example of how it can impact us. it led to many governments taking measures to protect their currencies and, for example, restricting imports, which directly impacted our ability to get supply on the platform. so, this is the kind of headwind that we'll have to fight again.
and this is very much something that we see across all the markets. there are some differences, of course. some markets are more affected by those kind of measures. but it's something that we see happening across africa at the moment.
however, we're very confident that our plan to focus on supply and distributors and increasing our relevance to the biggest and major suppliers in the markets can mitigate those impacts and is the right one in this complicated macroeconomic context. then on your second question, when it comes to the mix of categories. so, as i mentioned, we're scaling back first-party grocery in some geographies, not all of them, by the way. we want to make sure that we keep pushing and we keep investing in that segment in selected geographies which makes sense.
we actually -- i mean, the fact that we want to be more reasonable and more focused in the new categories that we develop doesn't prevent us from doing the right things on the other categories. so, we're also developing high roi categories such as consumer electronics, like i mentioned, and this does not conflict with our push on everyday categories such as health, beauty, and fashion, for example. specifically on your question on take rates on those categories, the high [inaudible] categories, indeed, we don't sell a phone or laptop or tv with the same margin at which -- that we would capture for, let's say, a pair of shoes. however, what matters to us is the whole equation with our logistic costs and our marketing costs.
we know for a fact that on the consumer electronic categories, our operating model works, and we can get very healthy for economics across all of our markets from those categories. so, we're very confident in the fact that we need to develop or build supply on these categories, and it does not conflict with our focus on everyday categories. antoine, may i take -- let you take the question on cash.
antoine maillet-mezeray -- chief financial officer
yes, i'll take the third one. the cash burn is a function of three things: capex, working cap movement, and ebitda. regarding the capex, 2022 has been, so far, a year of investment, and we intend to decrease the capex investment in the coming quarters. on working cap, we have been, this quarter, impacted by payment of jumia anniversary marketing invoices, which impacted significantly.
and we must keep in mind that in the market we are operating in here in the current macro, trust with suppliers is very important, and we have consciously decided to be super sharp on payment terms engine from time to time to secure the product to pay in advance. this has to be conducted orchestral. then the key driver to reduce cash burn is reducing the cost, and we're going to reduce ebitda. at this stage, it's a bit too early to give more guidance, and we'll give you more information in the q4 release.
catherine o'neill -- citi -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
your next question for today is coming from lamont williams at stifel.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
how you doing? thanks for taking my questions. the first is on food delivery. it's been one of the fastest growing categories in the last couple quarters. did you just talk about the unit economics for that category for food delivery overall? and then secondly, on the sales and marketing cost.
how are you thinking about the balance between what level you can have for marketing costs and still grow your active customer base at a pretty healthy rate? how do you think about where that balance is and kind of -- how well are they kind of an absolute expense rate [inaudible] thank you.
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
all right. so, for your first question on food delivery. so, that's our restaurant segment. so, as we mentioned, the trends are pretty good, plus 25% year on year gmv growth.
and we're very happy with the dynamics that we see in the sector. this is very much a core part of our business, and we intend to keep on pushing in this segment, especially in a very successful geography like nigeria. anyway, you mentioned economics. this is a segment that we intend to manage with the same level of increased discipline, increased focus, and increased level of execution across the board.
we are open to stopping projects on a country-by-country basis if we believe they're not adding value, and we'll really apply the same principle that we are playing to the rest of the e-commerce business. on your second question toward the balance between marketing and growth, if i get it correctly. very interestingly, we have many success cases in the group of countries that have been able to manage very, very -- i mean, very good level of efficiency in marketing spend while building up new categories and building growth for the whole business and a very healthy -- with a very healthy economy. so, we don't really see a balance between growing and spending in marketing.
it's more about doing the right thing, spending on the right channels with the right level of efficiency. having said that, for q4, we reiterate our guidance on marketing spend. and we -- of course, marketing spend remains a part of the strategy. and i may have missed your first question.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
no, actually, can i just follow up question on the assortment? you talked about there are some gaps in assortment and you kind of -- you're going to move back into consumer electronics. are there any other categories where you might see some gaps in the assortment that you can give a little more detail on?
francis dufay -- acting chief executive officer
very good question. so, as we mentioned, we -- i mean, you know, it really -- we want to open the book country by country, geography by geography, which is what makes sense for the business. we need that kind of level of granularity. when you look at country by country, the overall -- i mean, the big picture is that our core categories are more or less the same across the board.
and that's where we know that we have very good customer traction and we can have healthy economics, and we know it for a fact. that's electronics, including phones, tv, computing -- consumer appliance, home categories, fashion, and beauty. these are the bread and butter categories of jumia economics, in general. and across those categories, we see that -- i mean, all countries are not on the same level of development, and we are trying to do the right decisions country by country, category by category, distributor by distributor, brand by brand to improve our assortment and get the supply.
these are really basic. we want to win at this stage. of course, there are ways to go more, to go deeper, and to expand into new categories. i mean, i can give you an example.
last year, ivory coast did great progress on building the category of agricultural inputs, agricultural tools, and insurance. this is just an example. we're open to expanding into new categories. but really, at this stage, we just want to make sure we get the basics right.
lamont williams -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
