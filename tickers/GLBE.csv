amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, erika, and welcome, everyone. thank you all for joining us on our first earnings call as a public company. we are proud and excited to have lifted publicly mid-may on nasdaq under the ticker glbe. as such, i would like to start by thanking our incredible and growing team of employees, already more than 400 around the globe with dozens who have joined us just this quarter.
this team's hard work and unequivocal dedication has brought us to where we are and will drive our continued growth and success going forward. i would also like to thank our growing community of investors, both those who supported us in the past as a private company and those who have joined us more recently at and post the ipo. we are honored by the trust you have put in us and are excited to deliver on our mission to make global e-commerce border agnostic. and last but certainly not least, i would like to express our deep gratitude to our loyal merchant partners, already more than 500 of them across north america, the u.k., europe, and asia, who have put their trust enough to handle their cross-border online sales and deliver a seamless localized experience to their shoppers regardless of where they are around the globe.
turning to the results, i am pleased to report that q2 was another record quarter for us. gmv grew to $326 million, representing 95% growth year on year. revenues amounted to $57 million or 92% year-on-year growth. our gross profit grew even faster by 113% year on year to $20.6 million, driven by gross profitability margin expansion to 36% in q2, up from 32.4% in the same quarter last year.
thanks to our growing economies of scale and increased efficiencies. we continue to operate on the basis of a very efficient operating model, yielding an adjusted ebitda for the quarter of $7.6 million, representing 145% growth year on year. during today's call, we will provide details on our q2 results, as well as q3 and 2021 full-year guidance. but given that this is our first earnings call post the ipo, we will begin by spending a bit more time than we will in the future earnings calls covering the business, our strategy, and the opportunities ahead, for the benefit of many of you who may be new to the global-e story.
here at global-e, we have purpose-built a global end-to-end e-commerce platform and service that enables merchants to transact with shoppers from anywhere in the world by localizing both merchants' and shoppers' experiences and seamlessly overcoming the many barriers of cross-border trade, making global e-commerce border agnostic. we operate within a huge market opportunity presented by cross-border business-to-consumer, or b2c, policies. for the past decades, the retail world has experienced an accelerated shift toward e-commerce, with growth in online sales outpacing that of traditional retail. this shift has seen great acceleration during the recent covid-19 pandemic, but the trend has been strong well before the pandemic hit.
concurrently, the rise in social media, which is global by nature, has dramatically changed the way consumers discover brands worldwide. together, these two strong secular trends result in an ever-increasing growth in the share of direct-to-consumer, or d2c, sales as merchants put more and more strategic focus on this channel. d2c enables merchants to strengthen their relationships of shoppers worldwide, enhance their brands, attain valuable data, and enjoy higher margins. as a result of a combination of these and other market factors, cross-border e-commerce transactions are expected to continue to grow, outpacing the growth in domestic e-commerce by a factor of two.
forrester expects that by 2023, the cross-border e-commerce markets will reach $736 billion. this creates a huge opportunity for brands to sell globally, as they typically see around 30% of e-commerce traffic being international. but this is where the music stops for many of the merchants. when you look at their actual sales figures, typically no more than 5% to 10% come from international shoppers.
in other words, many merchants are not able to convert this enormous international traffic into actual sales, leaving a lot of money on the floor. this is because of the many structural barriers that stand between them and their international shoppers, who rightfully expect a seamless and localized shopping experience. but localizing the experience for even a single market is painful and difficult. a merchant needs to support the local language, present attractive prices in local currencies, support the local payment methods that are prevalent in that market, offer a compelling shipping and delivery experience, guarantee a full landed cost, including all relevant import duties and taxes, and more.
now multiply these challenges by 50 or 100 markets, it becomes nearly impossible to overcome. there is no one-size-fits-all solution as shoppers from each market have their own different expectations with regard to their localized shopping experience. hence, merchants of all sizes find the do-it-yourself cross-border strategy to be complex, expensive, time-intensive, inflexible, and highly difficult to scale and maintain. this is where global-e comes in.
our software seamlessly connects to any e-commerce platform the merchant is using via plugins and client-side scripts with built and maintain. once integrated onto the merchant site, we add a deep and rich level of localization to the e-commerce store experience. for the shoppers, we localize all aspects of the shopping journey right from the moment they enter the website. we support localized marketing messaging in over 25 languages.
we use our proprietary-built localized pricing engine to present pricing in more than 100 currencies and support different pricing structures based on the shopper's location, local market convention, and the merchant's pricing strategy. we enable shoppers to check out in their native language and to choose their favorite means of payment out of over 150 payment methods we already support. we pre-calculate import duties and taxes and can either embed them in the product price or collect them at checkout, thereby simplifying the customs clearance process and allowing for a fully guaranteed land of cost growth for both the shopper and the merchant. we hone an extensive network of more than 20 shipping carriers, including market-specific methods, such as cash on delivery or delivery to drop-off points, offering multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.
and we even provide local after-sales support and returns management via multilingual shopper services and multiple returns options, including prepaid and local returns in relevant markets. for the merchants, we made selling internationally as seamless and effective as selling domestically. the greatly improved localized shopper experience increases sales conversion, enabling merchants to better capitalize on their valuable international shopper traffic by generating a considerable uplift in international traffic conversion, often exceeding 60% after they begin to use our platform. we provide our merchants with the flexibility to rapidly and efficiently expand internationally and grow to new markets where and when they want to with little to no upfront investment, using their existing storefront and maintaining their own brand experience and direct relationship with their shoppers.
furthermore, we enable our merchants to offload complexities and risks, which are otherwise presented by transacting cross-border, making the selling and fulfillment process for international orders as simple as that of domestic sales. we provide all of these capabilities by means of our comprehensive end-to-end cloud delivery technology platform, built on top of a highly scalable multilayered tech stack, integrated and coupled with a diverse ecosystem of technology and service partners via dozens of open apis. from leading e-commerce platforms, such as shopify, salesforce, magento, bigcommerce, and others, through the payment providers like adyen, worldpay, klarna, and others, through the shipping carriers such as dhl, fraud management providers such as forter, and many other partners providing value-added services, such as translations, online marketing, and more, with several of these, including facebook, shopify and dhl, we have already struck broader strategic partnerships including mutual client referrals, given the significant value we generate for all players in the ecosystem. but this is only half of the story which is made whole by our unique data engine which generates specific, actionable, and data-driven recommendations for our merchants based on the deep, broad, and rapidly growing datasets we have.
we refer to these recommendations as smart insights. our smart insights are country, price point, and vertical-specific, and focused on shopper behavior. the value of our massive and fast-growing dataset is due to its depth and breadth. based on this data, and coupled with all operational experience accumulated over the years, we enjoy both economies of scale and economies of skills, which enable us to optimize merchant cross-border sales on a market-by-market basis.
by leveraging our smart insights, merchants can provide optimized experiences for shoppers, resulting in better conversion and more revenue. we win, thanks to several things we believe we do best. first, we offer merchants of all sizes, from small emerging brands to the world's largest retailers, the most potent combination of an easy-to-integrate proprietary technology platform and a full end-to-end solution. second, we are diversified by vertical merchant sector and destination markets.
a wide-reaching scale enables us to provide a solution to merchants in any region in the world, as we are the only cross-border enabler with a truly global footprint. third, our highly differentiated and fast-growing data assets serve as the basis for a powerful flywheel effect. the optics we generate for our merchants drive more sales, which in turn creates more data and even smarter insights, which are fed back into our system in order to generate even more uplift, attracting even more new merchants to the platform and so on. fourth, on top of our highly efficient sales and marketing teams, we enjoy our growing ecosystem of partners and merchants that act as a meaningful source of referrals and lead regeneration.
fifth, the mission-critical nature of our platform, a coupled with the results and value adds, we are able to generate for our merchant partners, yield very high customer stickiness, providing a sound base for continued strong gmv expansions. and finally, as a founder-led business, we built and maintain a very customer-centric culture throughout the ranks of the organization. we put our merchants first in everything we do. looking forward, and in order to continue capturing the immense market opportunities that lie ahead, we are pursuing multiple key growth levers in parts.
first, we continue to add more merchants onto the platform across our main geography, namely north america, u.k., and continental europe. we have a very strong pipeline to further support our growth. this includes both new merchants and continued land-and-expand efforts, winning additional operating lanes for existing merchants, as well as onboarding additional merchants within existing brand groups. as an example, during q2, we launched tag heuer, sephora, and rimowa, which are all part of the lvmh group, of which we have already launched multiple brands in the past.
furthermore, in the months following their launch, tag heuer added many more destination markets to our platform. another example is the value lingerie brand, la perla, which went live with us at the beginning of the year, and during q2, added many more destination markets and also went live with la perla beauty, their sister brand, which specializes in beauty and personal care products. second, we are making progress on our expansion plans in new geographies with an emphasis on asia-pacific. during q2, we launched our apac-based merchant theory hong kong, which is part of the fast retailing group.
last quarter, we also opened a new office in tokyo. third, we continue to build capabilities and broaden our range of value-added services, focusing on highly localized capabilities that further enhanced our level of support for large merchants and new verticals, such as consumer electronics. we believe some of these new capabilities could potentially be rolled out faster by buying versus building. and hence, we are gearing up our managerial infrastructure for supporting such future m&a opportunities.
as such, nir, one of my co-founders who is also with us today on this call, has recently transitioned to the role of president, allowing him to devote much more of his attention to corporate and business development efforts, which will be spearheaded by a new corporate development department we are assembling. nir still retains ultimate responsibility for global sales and customer success, which are now overseen by ran fridman, who recently joined us as our new chief revenue officer. last but not least, we continue to focus on expanding our work with the various partners that take part of our large and growing ecosystem. with regards to that, it is worth mentioning that we are on track with the rollout of our newly established exclusive strategic partnership with shopify.
we continue signing up and going live with shopify-based merchants on an ongoing basis. in parallel, the respective development and product teams from both companies are working together on a new and deeper integration of global-e's offering into the shopify platform and checkout. this new integration is expected to be finalized later this year. once operational, this new integration should allow an even more effortless go-live process for new merchants and even more seamless referrals of shopify-based merchants from various channel partners.
in conclusion, we are thrilled to have joined the public market and strongly believe in the tremendous growth opportunity that this new phase of global-e's life presents us with. we will continue to serve our merchants and their shoppers wherever they are around the globe and generate value for them, as well as for our large and growing ecosystem of partners, all the while, pursuing our ultimate mission to make global e-commerce truly border agnostic, and with that, i'll hand it over to ofer, our cfo, to go over our financial results in more depth.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, amir, and thanks again, everybody, for joining us today for our first earnings call as a public company. we are very pleased that our strong business momentum is continuing through q2. since this is our first earnings call, i'd like to start by providing a brief overview of our financial model, and then i'll go through our second-quarter results in detail. following that, i'll move on to give guidance for the third quarter, as well as for the full-year 2021.
i'd like to point out that in addition to our gaap results, i'll also be discussing certain non-gaap results. our gaap financial results along with the reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap results can be found in our earnings release. global-e generates revenue from service fees and fulfillment services. service fee revenue is generated as a percentage of the gmv that flows through our platform for the usage of our integrated platform solution that bundles several components which we believe are essential to achieve improved sales conversion of our merchants' international traffic.
fulfillment services revenue generated through our offering of shipping and handling which are offered on an optional basis but typically selected due to convenience and competitive pricing achieved based on our economies of scale. our rapid growth in gmv continued in q2 as we generated $326 million of gmv, an increase of 95% year over year. total revenue for the three months that ended on june 30, 2021, were $57.3 million, up 92% year over year. service fees revenues were $21.1 million, up 104%.
fulfillment services revenue were up 86% to $36.2 million. the higher growth in service fees revenues relative to fulfillment services revenue was driven in part by particularly strong growth in sales from the luxury brands we serve. luxury items are typically characterized by higher average order values, resulting in higher service fees relative to fulfillment revenues, which are far less impacted by the value of the goods. thus, from a p&l perspective, a higher share of luxury sales result in a structurally lower take rate with a higher service fee component and a higher gross profit margin.
while we generated considerable growth all across the business, i would like to point out the continued accelerated growth of our u.s. outbound revenue, reflecting the deepening of our penetration into the market, as we continue to witness high levels of satisfaction from merchants. u.s. outbound revenue was up 131% year over year.
we do not plan to disclose quarterly net dollar retention metrics, but i'm happy to share that our ndr dynamic through the first half of 2021 continued to track well, driven by the increasing focus and effort devoted by merchants to developing their d2c cross-border e-commerce businesses, coupled with conversion uplifts enabled by our continuously enhanced platform capabilities, as well as existing merchants' launches of additional destination markets on our platform. in the quarter, we were pleased to see significant contribution of gmv and revenue from some of the new logos we laid out in our q1 results, such as skims from kim kardashian, as well as regional expansion of existing merchants in q1, such as marks and spencer, which added 47 new markets, and hugo boss, which launched 12 new markets with us. fulfillment revenue were positively affected by increased post-brexit clearance fees. due to the new rules related to cross-border e-commerce vat in the eu, which came into forth on july 1st, we expect a decrease in book clearance fees revenues and costs, resulting in a slight reduction in take rate but with an insignificant effect on gross profit going forward.
now, let's review the income statement in more detail. gross profit continued to grow even faster than our top line, as we continue to improve gross margin based on our economies of scale and improved efficiencies. in q2, gross profit was $20.6 million, up 113% year over year and representing a gross margin of 36% compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. we believe that gross margin expansion to be structural and sustainable as it results mainly from increased economies of scale, improved operational processes, and pricing optimization.
r&d expense was up 59% year over year, totaling $5.7 million or 10% in revenue. the continued growth in our r&d investments allows us to continue to scale and enhance our platform offering, adding additional features and capabilities, including the development of a new integration to shopify which amir mentioned earlier, and our multi-local capabilities which allow us to access new merchant verticals and expand our total addressable market. sales and marketing expenses, excluding the amortization expenses related to the shopify warrant, $4.5 million or 7.9% of revenue compared to $1.9 million or 6.5% of revenue in the same period last year. we continue to invest in sales and marketing, enhancing our sales teams and marketing efforts in current outbound markets, as well as new ones, to support our accelerated growth, while still maintaining very high efficiency levels.
shopify warrants-related amortization expense was $25.5 million. including these expenses and marketing expenses for the quarter totaled $30 million. general and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, or 7.6% of revenue, compared to $2.7 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago period. general and administrative expenses reflect additional expenses relating to being a public company, including our d&o insurance policy cost since the ipo.
adjusted ebitda was $7.6 million, representing a 13.3% adjusted ebitda margin, increasing from $3.1 million or 10.4% margin in the same period last year. net loss was $22.2 million compared to a net loss of $0.4 million in the year-ago period, a direct outcome of the amortization expense related to the shopify warrants. net profit excluding the amortization expense related to the shopify warrants was $3.3 million. switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we ended q2 with $488 million in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities, a significant increase resulting from the ipo proceeds.
operating cash flow in the quarter was $6.9 million compared to $10.3 million a year ago, impacted by an increase in receivables. moving to our financial outlook, we are raising our q3 and full-year guidance significantly. in our guidance, we are taking into account the potential impact of the additional opening of physical stores and a gradual increase in traveling mainly during q4 toward the holiday season. for q3, we're expecting gmv to be in the range of $328 million to $338 million at the midpoint of the range.
this represents a growth rate of 76% versus q3 of 2020. we expect q3 revenue to be in the range of $54.3 million to $56.3 million. this represents a growth rate of 66% at the midpoint of the range versus q3 of 2020. for adjusted ebitda, we are expecting a profit in the range of $2.8 million to $3.8 million.
for the full year of 2021, we are raising our guidance significantly. we anticipate gmv to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion, representing nearly 76% annual growth at the midpoint of the range. revenue is expected to be in the range of $227 million to $231 million, representing a growth rate of 68% at the midpoint of the range. for adjusted ebitda, we are expecting a profit of $22 million to $24 million.
our outlook for the full year of 2021 reflects additional investments in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing, and product development, as well as incremental general and administrative costs associated with being a public company. we manage our business for the long term and do not plan to optimize for any single quarter. as our business grows, we intend to continue to invest as we pursue opportunities to expand our competitive modes. we plan to pursue growth opportunities in the transformation of b2c cross-border e-commerce while also continuing to demonstrate the scale and operational leverage over time.
and with that, amir, nil, and i are happy to take any of your questions. operator?

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much, and really appreciate all the details and color that you guys have walked through. i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about new brands and geos beginning to ramp. and if you can give us any color on particularly the shopify relationship, how much of that contributed here in the june quarter versus what you're expecting going forward. and then i have one follow-up question.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, james. it's amir. so generally speaking, we are seeing an uptick in additional brands joining the platform, which is reflected obviously both in the growth and the guidance, the updated guidance, that you've seen from us on top of course of additional growth from our existing brands.
now, referring specifically to shopify, we are seeing already an increase in our pipelines and the signups, especially on the smb front, kind of the smaller size merchants. we do expect as we guided before that we will see more movement on the pipeline with larger brand probably toward next year and the beginning of next year as we complete the new integration that we mentioned in our comments. in terms of financial impact, as such, we do expect, as we guided before, the main impact to kick in on the next year toward the second half of the year. so hopefully, that answers your question.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. that's good color. and then, i guess my other question is you mentioned that you know, obviously, there's been some organizational changes and that there may be some opportunities to buy additional capabilities, that would be a lot to be quicker to market than building them yourselves. can you give us a little more detail in terms of the timing? should we expect acquisitions to contribute at least some inorganic growth, or are they likely to be purely technology? just trying to get a little bit of color of kind of what you're thinking in terms of investment potential and impact.
thanks.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sure. so we're actually looking at both types of acquisition, both growth in activity, as well as additional capabilities. and as you said, we are definitely gearing up for that and looking at the potential space. i would say, in terms of timing, you should hopefully expect to see us do, i would say, at least one or maybe two transactions this christmas.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you very much.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, james. well appreciated.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of samad samana with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on the first public call. great to see the very strong results.
maybe if i think about -- i know, new brands, you just discussed that. but when i think about the pipeline of deals -- and ofer, i want to ask in the context, this is your first sort of guidance on the call. i'm just curious how much embedded in the guidance relies on new brands ramping, or how much of that is based on the existing portfolio. and then i have a follow-up question.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
hi, samad. it's nir. thank you for your question. a lot of our guidance is based on clients already integrated and live on our platform, so most of the contribution for the second part of the year is already from live clients.
there will be some contribution and a growing contribution toward a late q3 of small merchants going live on the platform that are already signed in to use our services and are currently in integration. but we expect most of the effect of the growing pipeline is from signed clients to affect all q1 and q2 results next year, and even more so in the second part of 2022.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe as a follow-up, i know you mentioned the robust trends on outbound to u.s., but i'm just curious if there's any other color on other geographies and maybe how they're trending, especially given that the world is kind of reopening at an uneven cadence. just any other notable pockets of strength beyond outbound into the u.s.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
in terms of the outbound, we've seen also tremendous increase in continental europe, which has grown over 200% year on year for us. so quite a lot of traction in supporting european brands going worldwide. in terms of inbound, we've seen even in markets where the world has signs of covid relief, such as israel with the vaccinations, i would say, widespread around the market and some other markets that have seen positive trends for a certain period of time such as australia, in not much of an effect in terms of the willingness of shoppers to buy. so we didn't see any much of fluctuation in terms of the inbound into the market of personal imports.
so far, we don't see, i would say, significant signs of covid relief.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
may i just squeeze one more and if you'll indulge me, i'm just curious, you've now been public for about four months, and i know it's not been a long amount of time. but have you seen a benefit to the brand in terms of engaging with other larger merchants, or bringing in merchants that may not have heard of global-e before. i'm just curious if going public has helped the brand in attracting newer types of customers into the pipeline.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, samad. this is amir. yes. we've quite clearly seen -- as a matter of fact we've seen very positive traction building up after our ipo.
we sense that we get even higher exposure now to key decision makers and in much higher confidence, i would say, as they go about to take their decision, especially because we are now the only cross-border platform that is publicly traded and kind of regulated and audited as such. so it gives a lot of the more confidence when he takes two brands, taking the decision who to work with.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. congrats on the strong results.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you very much, samad.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you and good afternoon. couple of questions for me if i could. i'll start with amir first. gmv in the quarter and an absolute basis was actually up more in q2 than in q2 a year ago when you had the covid tailwind.
so just trying to drill down a little bit. what drove the outside strength in gmv? is it largely onboarding new merchants? was it just a broad set of existing merchants expanding to countries? any color there would be super helpful, just given the momentum and outside strength we saw there this quarter.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
hi, brent. it's ofer. i think there were, i would say, a couple of reasons for that. the first one is that we had very successful launches of new merchants in q1 that contributed significantly to our gmv growth in q2.
i think the second major factor is the fact that many brands have identified the d2c opportunity and put a lot of strategic emphasis on this channel. and when you couple that with that uplift in conversion that we are able to support, that generates a lot of gmv. and as we said, we do not disclose the ndr numbers on a quarterly basis but they're tracking really well. so those are the main drivers behind the growth.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful color there. i guess as a follow-up, ofer, you're now at 500-plus merchants. is there any way to quantify how many of those merchants or what portion of those merchants have rolled out global-e to all 200 countries? just trying to assess how much expansion potential there is at just within the existing customer footprint.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
hi, brent. it's nir. the vast majority of the merchants did deploy global-e throughout their international markets. so i wouldn't say if it's 80% or 90%, but the vast majority did.
however, the large merchants, specifically the super large merchants, are the ones that are deploying batches of markets with us. and with them, basically, there is a significant opportunity and still ahead of us. they are only 10% or 20% of the brand but they hold a significant portion of our gmv, and the growth opportunity with them is huge. we've seen that this year with the hugo boss giving us 12 more markets.
we've seen it with versace giving us additional markets this year. we've seen it with marks and spencer that added 47 more markets, which is the sixth consecutive year which we opened more markets with them. so with the large ones, we do see quite a lot of opportunities still ahead of us.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
very encouraging. last question from me. amir, strong pipeline of new merchants, you talked about looking the second half of the year. would you say the bulk of those continue to be luxury retail? or are you seeing a diversification of new merchants coming to global-e now? thanks.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i would say, brent, these are obviously some luxury brands in that as well. but it's actually all across the field that we see, including even some new verticals that we are starting to see traction on where we haven't been active before. so i would definitely say more diversification in terms of verticals is the trend.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
great to hear. thank you.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, brent.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of pat walravens with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you, and let me add my congratulations. so i guess, amir, maybe if you could just sort of specify for us what the top two or three things that you need to get done with shopify are in terms of the integrations. i think that would be helpful.
and then secondly, just how much of the potential benefit from that partnership have you seen so far?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. i wouldn't like to bore everyone with the technical details. the main things about the integration are technical. but i would say, generally speaking, it's making our services kind of the same services that you know just built in straight into the shopify checkout itself.
so making it a seamless transition, i would say, for the merchants. as they switch global-e on, it will just become part of their existing shopify checkout, as well as a deeper integration into the shopify system or backend as well, which should enable once the order -- it's a multi-phase project. so once the final phases are in, it will enable an even more seamless integration and kind of going live process for these merchants, and hopefully making it almost as easy as flipping a switch. so that is the intent, i would say, on the things that we still need to get done on the technical integration front.
in terms of the impact, as we guided, this is what we're seeing. we're on track. we are seeing an already initial kind of traction, additional traction in our pipeline as it's growing, including more and more smb shopify-based merchants that are going live with us. so we already see an increase in that.
but i would say financially, we'll probably see more of the impact toward kind of the first and second quarters of next year, and certainly onwards in the second half of next year once we have done the new integration kind of late this year, which would enable us to bring also it to the bigger enterprise-size merchants that are on shopify. hopefully that answers it.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
oh yeah. no, that's great. and then, ofer, if i could sneak one in for you. so a nice bump up in the gross margin.
i'm looking at it right at 36% this quarter from 33% last quarter. how should we think about q3? and then, just how should we think about the expansion over time? but q3 first.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
so the increased share of service fee revenues contributed to the gross margin expansion -- well, as the continued leveraging of our economies of scale and price optimization, we believe that the gross margin expansion is structural. basically, we expect the same trend to continue into the future. not in every quarter we will increase the gross profit as much as we did this quarter, but we certainly expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, pat.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of josh beck with keybanc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you all for taking the question, and my congratulations as well on new life as a public company at least. i wanted to ask about structural growth. in the cross-border market, i realize it's a challenging one to answer because it's a little bit of a nuance. but when i look at you are gmv growth projections for q3, it is much higher than all of the other gmv-oriented models that probably have a lot lower cross-border exposure.
so structurally, do you think there's maybe a greater emphasis to start selling in a cross-border fashion? is it just simply going to be less impacted by reopening? any qualitative commentary there would be great.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
hi, josh. thank you for your question. it's nir. i think one of the main differentiators allowing us, i would say, to see higher growth in q3 is our diversification in terms of inbound markets worldwide.
our approach and our reach is truly global. we are not a -- we don't have a single market that is a two-digit market with us in terms of inbound. and this diversity allows us to enjoy, i would say, the growth of global-e e-commerce. and so despite signs of relief in certain markets here and there, other markets do not see it, and we see balancing in between.
and even in the markets that experienced some relief, we didn't see a lot of changes in the way shoppers are buying online. so all in all, we are very positive in the growth trend going forward, and i think we're a bit differentiated here through global footprint.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. and then just wanted to follow up on the first apac merchant win. obviously, that's an exciting development. i'm curious when you look at the apac offering, do you feel like the platform and the partnership ecosystem is fairly mature and maybe up to par with other markets, and so the emphasis now is much more about really stepping on the go-to-market? or is it a little bit of both of you had probably some critical mass of partnerships and platform in place, but there's more work to do there before you really start to get perhaps more aggressive on the go-to-market? just help us think about that balance, please.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
i think it's a combination of both that you mentioned. yes, we do see great opportunity in apac and we do intend to invest much more. but as you stated, we do plan to enhance our partnership and channel partners in order to support it. yes, we do have channel partners that are global in nature.
that would be the likes of dhl, or facebook, or partnership with shopify, but we are building also apac-specific partnership. this is in process and we are hoping we will have good news within q3 and q4 to announce about the partnership to support that growth as well. and on the back of it, we expect much more contribution coming out of apac into our pipeline and into our numbers, i would say, from the second quarter and third quarter of 2022.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. congrats, team.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of brian peterson with raymond james. please proceed with your question.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question and congrats on the really strong results. so first question for me, just kind of high level, we don't typically see 90%-plus revenue growth and gmv growth at this scale. if we're thinking longer term, what are kind of key swing factors on growth? and how do we think about the sales and marketing investments as the right level of sales and marketing investments to drive that?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think to answer the first part of your question, we are very effective in our sales and marketing approach. and over the hill historically, we've been less than 10% spend on sales and marketing out of our revenue. and the reason we were able to do it is because we had historically, on the one hand, huge ndr with over 140% quite stable that supported our growth with existing merchants that continued to grow and enjoy the benefits all platform, it brings to merchants wanting to scale up international. and in parallel to that, we have really good win ratio on merchants stepping into a tailwind of a very aggressively growing market, with merchants trying to scale cross-border.
so it's a combination of both, together with the fact that we basically have a pool with no leaks in it. our gdr numbers are sub-2% historically on an annual average. so we don't actually lose the businesses we have. we win much more business coming in, and we grow the business that we already have in.
and the combination of it allows us to grow very fast even at the scale we already have. and we do expect to continue this high growth rates going forward. so higher two-digit numbers is something we expect to continue without going into the foreseeable future as we do have a quite a lot of levers that we continue to push. in terms of sales and marketing, we do spend a lot.
you can see in our q2 numbers, we grew more than 100% in the investment in sales and marketing. still doing it very, very efficiently as a percentage out of our revenue. but we do scale up. we scale up in the current markets where we are already present across continental europe, across north america, as well as in new regions.
we established our operations in japan with the first two employees in japan. we are intending to roll out additional markets in apac late q3 and early q4. and so we do intend to invest much more within sales and marketing in different aspects, as well as building our channel partners to continue to do it efficiently and at scale.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great perspective. and maybe just a follow-up. the u.s. outbound strength grew over 130% year over year this quarter.
i'm curious if you can kind of shed any more light on what drove that. and what are you typically displacing when you pick up a new merchant? i know you kind of mentioned smb, shopper by partnership. but i'm curious what kind of functionality somebody might have in place, particularly looking at the u.s. outbound margins.
thank you.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
usually, we just enhance the basic stores that the merchant has. we look at it as a green field. there's not much competition were in place. most of it is uncharted territory as the merchant is sub-optimal in the international journey.
and what we bring to the table is our platform to enhance the current shop, whether it would be on the salesforce commerce, bigcommerce, or shopify. so on that aspect, we just we just get them to do better within the current operations. the reason for the growth in u.s. outbound that is reflected in our numbers is basically there's quite a good traction for u.s.
brands. a lot of digital-first brands coming out of the u.s. and now with the social networks and global influencers, we've seen tremendous growth of those digital-first brands. i think that the skims of kim kardashian that launch with us in q1 is a great example.
we've seen tremendous track record and performance through q2 with the merchant growing. and we have several of those that launch with us over the last few quarters, and we've seen great traction with them, as well as many new smb brands that are coming in and growing, now fueled further by the shopify partnership.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst

amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, erica, and welcome, everyone. i hope everyone is keeping safe and healthy. thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings call, and let's jump straight into our third quarter results. i'm proud to report that q3 was another record quarter for us.
gross merchandise value, or gmv, grew to $352 million or 86% growth year on year. revenues for the quarter were $59.1 million, representing 77% year-on-year growth. our gross profit grew even faster by 127% year-on-year reaching $22.8 million. our gross profitability margin further expanded in q3 to 38.6%, up from 30.2% in q3 of last year, thanks to our growing economies of scale and increased efficiencies.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter totaled $7.7 million, almost tripling year over year, attributed primarily to our highly efficient operating model. before we dive further in, i would like to mention that from a broader market perspective, during q3, we have started to see signs of the anticipated return to normality in e-commerce growth trends. we have seen key markets beginning to exhibit various levels of covid relief in the form of reopening of physical retail, swinging the pendulum of consumer spend slightly back from the record levels of e-commerce market share we have witnessed throughout the height of the pandemic. that being said, we expect e-commerce to continue gaining market share faster than during pre-pandemic times, as new consumer audiences, as well as small to large brands alike are shifting more weight toward e-commerce.
within e-commerce, the d2c, or direct-to-consumer, cross-border e-commerce market opportunity is immense and continues to grow significantly faster than the overall e-commerce market. as such, during q3, we continued to reinvest heavily into our business, and have made great progress across all our key strategic growth levers. first, we continue to onboard more merchants onto our platform across all geographies we operate in, while expanding our work with existing merchants and brand groups. for example, our relationship with the lvmh luxury group continue to develop as during q3, we launched with two more group houses, givenchy and sephora asia, the latter contributing to our growing business in asia pacific.
another example of a successful new merchant relationship is the fast-growing sports clothing brand, alo yoga, which is our latest large enterprise brand to go live on the shopify platform, further exemplifying the value of our strategic partnership with shopify. this quarter also saw several merchants expanding the scope of their partnership with us to additional lanes. notable examples include the consumer electronics brand, sennheiser, which added 15 additional markets; the luxury jewelry brand, boucheron, part of the kering luxury group that added the us and europe, as well as spanish footwear brand, camper, which added support for 15 new markets. second, our direct sales channels continue to be augmented by an ever-expanding list of strong channel partners.
the latest partnership we announced is with the australian post group, yielding us access to their vast australian client base and providing further support for our penetration into the apac region. third, we continue to develop and enhance our multi-local support features and capabilities, launching with jabra, our first global consumer electronics brand, as well as with the football club leeds united, representing the latest addition to our growing list of sports club merchant partners. another notable feature we deployed for our merchants at the beginning of q3 was support for the new oss and ioss value-added tax regimes in europe. with such support provided natively by the global-e platform, the otherwise complicated transition from the old distance selling vat regime to the new ioss one was seamless and transparent for all our merchants.
furthermore, due to the complexity, which is involved in supporting the new regime, some of our merchants, such as the sports club arsenal, for example, which in the past operated in europe by themselves, chose now to move the european markets to be operated by global-e. across all these channels, our pipeline remains stronger than ever. fourth, we continue to put significant effort and resources into our fast-growing strategic operation with shopify. we are seeing great market traction with the shopify merchant base as part of our partnership with enterprise merchants such as netflix and alo yoga, as well as with a growing number of smaller emerging brands.
on the technical side, we recently completed the first phase of our new native integration into shopify, with the first pilot merchants already live and selling through the new seamless plug-in. netflix, whom i've already mentioned, is actually one of the first enterprise merchants to be selling through the new native integration. over the next quarters, we intend to continue working together with shopify in order to roll out the additional phases of the new native integration, which is expected to lead to an even more seamless merchant go-live process. last but not least, in parallel to capturing our fast organic growth opportunities, consistent with our previously announced strategy, we intend to continue exploring synergetic m&a opportunities as nonorganic options to further enhance our platform's capability.
as you all know, our people have always been the key element of our success. as such, throughout q3, we continue to recruit many more great and passionate individuals. they join our super talented and dedicated teams around the globe, helping us build sound foundations of our continued future growth. as part of these efforts, we also recently signed a long-term lease for a new r&d center and headquarters in israel.
we cannot wait to move to our new home in q2 of next year once the renovation work is done. we are still in the early innings of direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce. and within it, we believe that we are just taking off. we are a reputation-first company and merchants' recognition of the tremendous value we create for them and for the entire ecosystem continues to grow.
day-in and day-out, more and more merchants from around the world are coming on to our platform to grow their international business and serve their shoppers around the world. we believe that our leading end-to-end solution, coupled with our execution capabilities, position us for rapid growth and success well into the future. and with that, i will hand it over to ofer, our cfo, to go over our financial results in more depth, as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, amir, and thanks again, everybody, for joining us today for our quarterly earnings call. we are pleased that our business has been tracking well, and our strong growth momentum continued throughout q3. i'd like to point out again that in addition to our gaap results, i'll also be discussing certain non-gaap results. our gaap financial results along with the reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap results can be found in our earnings release.
as amir mentioned, our rapid growth in gmv continued in q3 as we generated $352 million of gmv, an increase of 86% year over year. we continue to tap into the massive opportunity of the direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce market, which is growing much faster than the overall e-commerce market, while the reopening of physical retail and the return of e-commerce growth rates to normality is evident. total revenue for the three months ended september 30, 2021 were $59.1 million, up 77% year over year. service fees revenues were $23 million, up 89%.
fulfillment services revenue were up 71% to $36.2 million. the higher growth in service fees revenues relative to fulfillment services revenue was driven mainly by the launch of our multi-local offering for which we typically do not provide fulfillment services as the model is largely based on local shipping. another factor is a decrease in the customs clearance fees revenues alongside custom clearance costs as a result of the new oss and ioss rules related to cross-border e-commerce vat in and into the eu, which came into force on july as we mentioned in our previous call. while we generated considerable growth across the business, we've continued to experience higher paced growth in our us outbound revenue, reflecting the strengthening reputation of global-e in the us market.
us outbound revenue was up 91% year over year. in addition, during the quarter, we were pleased to see continued significant contribution of gmv and revenue from some of the new logos we launched during the year. now, let's review the income statement in more detail. gross profit continues to grow significantly faster than our top line as we continue to improve gross margins, leveraging our scale and improving efficiencies.
in q3, gross profit was $22.8 million, up 127% year-over-year and representing a gross margin of 38.6% compared to 30.2% in the same period last year, also affected by the higher share of service fee revenue. we are very pleased with our margin expansion, and we continue to put efforts to support this trend. moving on to operational expenses. on the r&d front, we continue to invest in the development and enhancement of our platform to further expand our offering and lay the foundation for future growth.
as amir mentioned, during q3, we continued the development of the new shopify platform integration in collaboration with shopify team. we have already launched the first pilot, including the onboarding of netflix. r&d expense, excluding stock-based compensation, was $6.4 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $3.6 million or 10.9% in the same period last year as we scale up our investment in r&d. total r&d spend in q3 was $8.3 million.
we continue to invest in sales and marketing to support our fast growth and capture the growing market opportunity, and we continue to see a very healthy and growing pipeline while still maintaining high efficiency levels. sales and marketing expense, excluding the amortization expenses related to the shopify warrant, was $5.4 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $2.2 million or 6.5% of revenue in the same period last year. shopify warrants-related amortization expense was $29.4 million. including this expense, sales and marketing expenses for the quarter totaled $34.9 million.
general and administrative expense, excluding stock-based compensation, was $4.5 million or 7.5% of revenue compared to $1.7 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. this expense reflects the full quarter impact of additional expenses related to being a public company, including our d&o insurance policy costs and also onetime costs related to the follow-on secondary offering, which we executed during the quarter. total g&a spend in q3 was $7.8 million. adjusted ebitda totaled $7.7 million, representing a 13.1% adjusted ebitda margin, increasing from $2.7 million or 8.2% margin in the same period last year.
net loss was $28.5 million compared to a net income of $1.3 million in the year ago period, a direct outcome of the amortization expense related to the shopify warrant. net profit excluding the amortization expense related to the shopify warrants was $0.9 million. switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. we ended q3 with $492 million in cash, cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities, which reflects the high level of liquidity.
operating cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 million compared to a negative operating cash flow of $0.5 million a year ago due to the increase in adjusted ebitda. moving to our financial outlook. we are raising our q4 and full year guidance. our guidance reflects the strong momentum of the business alongside the normalizing of e-commerce growth rates due to the reopening of physical stores.
for q4, we're expecting gmv to be in the range of $465 million to $475 million. at the midpoint of this range, this represents a growth rate of 55% versus q4 of 2020. we expect q4 revenue to be in the range of $76.4 million to $78.4 million. this represents a growth rate of 45% at the midpoint of the range versus q4 of 2020.
for adjusted ebitda, we expected a profit in the range of $7.3 million to $8.3 million. for the full year of 2021, we are raising our guidance and anticipate gmv to be in the range of $1.41 billion to $1.42 billion, representing nearly 83% annual growth at the midpoint of the range. revenue is expected to be in the range of $239 million to $241 million, representing a growth rate of 76% at the midpoint of the range. for adjusted ebitda, we're expecting profit of $27.9 million to $28.9 million.
our outlook for the full year of 2021 reflects additional investments in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing and product development, as well as incremental general and administrative costs associated with being a public company. in conclusion, we believe that there are tremendous opportunities for more high-pace growth well above the market average in the years to come. we are gearing ourselves up in order to be well positioned to capture all of these opportunities. exciting times ahead.
and with that, amir, nir and i are happy to take any of your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much and thanks for taking the time today. i want to ask, first, on your demand and ability to fulfill, are you seeing any adverse impacts right now from the well-publicized supply chain constraints, etc., that seem to be in the market and impacting crude production globally? and if so, has that been -- how are you factoring that into your outlook and planning?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, james. thanks for the question. this is amir. generally speaking, we ourselves don't think there any interruptions due to the challenges in the global logistics market for the reason that basically our entire volume of shipments goes via air, and we have very good and close relationships with our strategic logistics partner that partners in general that give us priority.
most of the challenges currently are -- in the world are in sea freight and not in air. having said that, we do see, from time to time, some challenges for merchants. some of our merchants have some inventory issues from time to time, but nothing material and nothing that to date has made any disruption in our business or in our merchant's business.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then, you highlighted that you're in a -- that you're starting to see good movement with shopify merchants and you're in the pilot phases. how are you thinking -- or better said, how should we be thinking about the ramp, the pace at which it will ramp? how big of a merchant base within the shopify group are you currently engaged with and ultimately targeting? just a bit more color on the ways to track and anticipate the evolution and ramp of that relationship.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
james, thank you for the question. it's nir. we do expect somewhat growth in the next quarters as we see demand and bookings of large shopify merchants, such as alo yoga that just launched with us, or netflix continue to build up. however, as we see strong bookings momentum also with large brands outside shopify through our partnership with sfcc, bigcommerce and others, we do expect the growth of shopify sharing mix to be gradual.
but overall, we see our bookings, i would say, growing at a fast pace versus last year. with last year, we nearly -- sorry, we more than doubled our new gmv bookings versus 2019. we expect this trend to continue this year with bookings currently at a pace to more than double versus 2020 numbers.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. thank you so much.
operator
the next question comes from samad samana with jefferies. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. maybe a follow up to james' question around shopify. the company rolled out shopify markets during the quarter, and we get a lot of questions about maybe what the difference is between what shopify markets is and what global-e is offering? and we think we know the differences, but just could you help us maybe clarify how you think about shopify markets and how that impacts the relationship that global-e has with shopify?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. thank you for the question, samad. it's nir. basically, as we see it and shopify sees it as well, shopify markets is a complementary solution to what global-e offers.
shopify markets comes to cater for the smaller smb brands that i would say is the vast majority in terms of number of shopify clients. however, the vast majority of the potential gmv in cross-border trading is concentrated at the top 1%, 2% of shopify merchants. and those do need, i would say, a more comprehensive solution, including the mor solution that global-e provides, including the high-touch, i would say, guidance into best practices, including customer services around the world in multiple languages that are not part of the current or future shopify markets offering, so with much more differentiation on high-touch services that are catered more for the larger brands.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, maybe if i think about the guidance, and i know you gave some color around it. but as we think about maybe some of the -- like if we could double-click on it, how are you thinking about -- have you factored in that maybe some of your clients may be impacted by supply chain issues? or just are you factoring in that the world will be more open? just maybe help us understand some of the factors that have been kind of accounted for in that initial outlook for the fourth quarter.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, samad. ofer, do you want to take that question?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
sure. so samad, thank you for the question. i think that even though there was a lot of uncertainty during the year, when we initially planned 2021, we thought that there might be some covid relief at some point in time, and we took that into account even in our original planning. so basically, that was taken into account through q3 and q4.
so it was already baked in our original guidance. and as we went through the year, we saw that we were sort of picking up momentum and growing fast, and we were able to update the guidance every quarter. and we are raising the guidance also toward q4. we feel confident and i think all those factors are already baked in our guidance.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and maybe i'd like to squeeze in a third one. just amir, you had mentioned -- m&a came up on the last call. the company had brought it up.
so i'm just curious if any update on the m&a front, especially with us being fairly close to year-end? should we still have that in mind for 2021? or should we now be starting to think about that more as a 2022 type of event?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, samad. indeed, we are -- we continue to explore potential m&a opportunities. we still -- we have some in the pipeline in various stages.
we do still expect, i would say, at least one announcement potentially this side of christmas. and yes, as we mentioned in the past as well, we do view non-organic growth as a means to enhance our -- the capabilities of the platform and our reach. so we definitely expect to continue exploring these in 2022 as well.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks for taking all my questions and congrats on all the success.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks a lot, samad.
operator
the next question comes from brent bracelin with piper sandler. please go ahead.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking the question here. one for amir and a clarification for ofer. amir, it's exciting to hear the netflix merch shop and alo yoga go live on shopify's platform this quarter. i was hoping just to drill down a little bit and really looking for color on like the scope deployments.
are you lighting up a handful of geos similar to the traditional merchants? are you lighting them up globally? how long did the onboarding process take in that kind of high-touch approach? just any additional color as you think about kind of onboarding now new merchants via kind of that shopify integration will be interesting.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. brent, just to make sure you're asking in terms of whether it's regional or global in terms of the market that we support for these brands or in terms of our ability to deploy the solution for brands around the world on shopify? i just want to make sure that i'm answering the right question.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes. just love to know onboarding, like how much challenging it was to onboard merchant, number one. and then, number two, you've talked about camper go into 15 new markets. you typically start with a retailer, a large retailer and a handful of markets and then spanned over time.
is that the same deployment method for these? or do they light up all 200 markets as they launch?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
got you. thank you for clarifying. so first, in terms of deployment, both these merchants deployed globally with us. so it wasn't a gradual or a subset launch.
it really -- it's on a case-by-case basis with the larger merchants, these two specific ones, regard -- irrespective of the fact that they're on shopify just as merchants decided to launch the entire world at the first go. in terms of complexity in deployment, i would say they were fairly in line with our, call it, regular process. netflix, as we mentioned on the call, went on the new integration. so as you can probably imagine, since this is the first deployment, there were some additional steps and checks, and it was slightly more complex from a project point of view.
but all in all, i would say there is nothing out of the ordinary in terms of these merchant deployment.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful color there. and just a clarification for ofer. gross profit, you talked about triple-digit growth here in q3 outpacing revenue. what drove the gross margin expansion, particularly on the software services side? and how sustainable are those trends?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you for that, brent. well, as you know, we have a very clear trend of gross margin improvement over time, which on a macro level is a result of our focus on leveraging our growing scale and ongoing optimization. in this specific quarter, the main drivers behind the improvement were the higher share of service fees and also the increase in service fee take rate, the ongoing optimization of our payment, shipping and fraud management component and there was also a slightly favorable mix. and as we go forward, we think this is fairly sustainable, and we will continue to put a lot of efforts to leverage our scale and continue to support this general trend of improvement.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
great to hear. thank you.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer

the next question comes from pat walravens with jmp securities. please go ahead.
joey marincek -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey. it's joey marincek on for pat. thank you so much for taking our questions and congrats on the nice results here. so first, how do you think about the potential to expand into other verticals? and then second, can you just remind us of your gmv concentration from your top merchants? and then maybe how you see that changing over time?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great. so i'll let nir take the first question and ofer, you can take the second one.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. thank you for the question. in terms of expanding our reach into new verticals, and i think that overall q3, we managed to penetrate two new significant verticals. one of them is consumer electronics with the successful launch of jabra across multiple geographies, as well as the substantial increase in operations with sennheiser, which is consumer electronics as well, so this is building our foothold into consumer electronics, where we haven't traded much or at all before.
this also supports our new, i would say, business models/vertical, which is a multi-local approach. so both jabra and, as amir mentioned earlier, leeds united are example of merchants that are moving into our multi-local approach where we support a domestic interaction with consumers worldwide. so it's not only a cross-border model where you ship for a single territory into multiple countries, it's actually deployment in multiple countries around the world and transacting locally with the clients. so we see quite a lot of expansion there.
and we do expect additional, very large brands to join us over this model in the coming quarters. so quite a lot of expansion in those two verticals in parallel to the continuous growth in our current main verticals around fashion, apparel, cosmetics, jewelry and others.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
referring to the second question, we have a relatively fragmented merchant base. our largest merchant share is decreasing over time. although this merchant is growing very nicely, but the entire company is growing faster. so the largest merchant is less than 10% of gmv.
and then, the top 10, including the largest merchant, are less -- are around, i would say, 30% of gmv. and i can give you some color on that. some of those top 10 are actually new merchants, just onboarded and came into this list. so it's -- i would say it's a dynamic structure.
but all in all, it is relatively fragmented.
joey marincek -- jmp securities -- analyst
super helpful. thank you. congrats on the quarter again.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks a lot.

the next question comes from josh beck with keybanc. please go ahead.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, team, for taking the question. i wanted to ask an industry question. you talked a bit about the reopening and certainly the impact on e-commerce. at the same time, it seems like there are a lot of folks that are going back to work, and they're going back to dining and there's a bit of apparel super cycle i think that's also taking place.
some of the companies have certainly called out strength in that vertical. so i'm just kind of curious how you would maybe balance those two factors and how they could interplay as we go into next year.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, josh. sure. so i would say, you are right, we agree with this observation.
on the one hand, there is physical reopening. on the other hand, there are other factors that are contributing to the continued growth in e-commerce spend. spend in general, and e-commerce spending in particular. and i would say all in all, the trends that we are seeing in the numbers and in our interactions with our clients are pretty much in line with the numbers that we baked into our guidance.
so we're going to -- you should take our kind of guidance as our view on how the market will continue to evolve.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and i wanted to ask a take rate question. i realize this is not how you manage the business.
it's much more of an output, but i'm getting a lot of questions on it. so when we do look at the fulfillment take rate, obviously, it was down, i think, sequentially and year over year. and it seems like there's a tax regime change from vat to this one-stop shopping and certainly, it seems to be a bit more simplified, a bit more streamlined. obviously, not material to the gross profit take rate because that went up.
but yes, should we think about this as more of a effectively like baseline in 3q '21 that incorporates that? and as we move forward, and again, i know it's not the most important metric, but it's going to be more influenced by things like mix and other factors? so i just want to kind of clarify the change in the quarter and what we should be mindful of in the future as well.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, josh. ofer, do you want to give josh some color around our take rate dynamics?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
sure. so yes, as you said, take rate has decreased this quarter when -- where actually service fee take rate has slightly increased to over 6.5%. while as you mentioned, the decrease in overall take rate was a result of the expected decrease in fulfillment take rate. there are two main drivers for that.
the first one is the fact you just mentioned, the oss and ioss implementation in europe. and yes, that's onetime -- i would say, a onetime step down. we don't expect to see additional influence from this change. the second driver is the fact that we have launched our multi-local offering, which for us is a very exciting opportunity, which we discussed in the previous quarter.
for the multi-local offering, we typically do not provide fulfillment services as the model is largely based on local shipping. so basically, those two factors are -- have influenced our take rate, but at the same time also contributed to our higher gross margin in this quarter. one of them is sort of a one-off step down, and the other will still accompany us in future quarters.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
crystal clear. thank you, ofer, and thank you. amir. appreciate it
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, josh.
operator
the next question comes from scott berg with needham. please go ahead.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on a strong quarter and thanks for taking my questions. i guess, i wanted to start off on kind of comparing maybe the most recent quarter with the time frame from a year ago. as you look at new customers that you sold in the quarter, is the -- i don't know, is the onus or pressure on them to be able to more quickly or accurately fulfill global e-commerce sales as strong as what it was maybe a year ago kind of during the earlier phases of the pandemic? or is there -- is maybe their priority maybe not as strong on the global e-commerce maybe requirements?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
scott, thank you for the question. it's nir. basically, we haven't seen a change in the sentiment of our merchants toward cross-border. i think that even on some aspects or some merchants, it's the other way around where we see more, i would say, momentum toward e-commerce as a secular trend of the growth of e-commerce expected to continue.
we've seen it with the rollout of multiple new markets. with existing, you've seen it in our land and expand number that is actually driving a substantial part of our growth. so we do see merchants continue to explore avenues to continue and expand in e-commerce, especially global e-commerce. so we haven't seen i would say, concentration back to my bias toward my home country or back to physical.
so still, as we see it, and we are quite optimistic about the long-term trend, as we see super tier one brands opting toward our model and toward the e-commerce cross-border, we do see this trend continue over time, maybe with some normalization that, as ofer explained, is already baked into our numbers.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
very good. helpful. and then, i wanted to ask a question on your -- in your press release, you talked about some strength in us outbound sales there. but how does the playbook work in selling to merchants in the us? is it very comparable and similar to as you sell some of the more established markets in maybe emea? or is the playbook maybe focused a little differently as you engage with us merchants?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you for the question. it's nir again. basically, the playbook itself or the approach to the client for, i would say, guiding them through the solution until we sign the rollout is the same across our different territories. there are some flavors to it, as a european merchant has different key geographies they want to focus on, they have more focus on vat related issue in the home market, etc., which we don't see for us brands, but these are flavors on the same process.
in terms of the pipeline itself, in the us, we see a bit more, i would say, mix toward shopify merchants as shopify has a stronger position in the us versus more traditional market where we see other platforms in more significant share of the mix.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for the color. great help.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, scott.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from brian peterson with raymond james. please go ahead.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
congrats on the really strong results, and it's great to hear that you guys are winning seemingly every single premier. that's near and dear to my heart. so first question i just wanted to ask kind of on the land size with customers. so obviously, cross-border is very, very thematic.
and it sounds like you're landing at larger levels than you were a few years ago. i'm curious how many geos on average does a new merchant take maybe versus a year or two ago? and what is the reasonable expectation for that metric going forward?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. i think the answer to the question would depend based on the merchant size, to start with. any merchant that we define as less than a very large enterprise would usually roll out in all international markets at get-go. so outside his home market or maybe two home markets, if they're already established in two, as they will roll out all of the international activities as a get-go.
with the large, i would say, more traditional brands, as the likes of the hugo bosses, the versaces of the world, you would see a more, i would say, phased approach as they do have traditional distribution agreements around the world. so basically, we see more phased rollout in countries where they can actually go into e-commerce direct and then they roll out another batch. and over time, when they have the ability and can actually deploy more markets, we see additional expansion. but in, i would say, pure players and all the clients that are not really, i would say, large traditional ones, we would see all markets at once.
usually, on average, we see merchants trading across 160 and 170 active markets.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. that's great color on that. maybe a higher-level question broadly. you mentioned returning to normal.
i think we're all trying to figure out what that is here. but you guys are launching with new merchants, you're expanding with those merchants, there's geo expansion. and obviously, cross-border, i think, is growing faster than overall e-commerce. so if we try to unpack that a little bit, what is the same-store gmv from brands and regions that have been on the platform for more than a year? any sense for how to unpack that?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. it's true that everybody is trying to understand what normalization actually means and yet i think we all feel that. i would say, generally speaking, that the -- if you look at the e-commerce equivalent of store -- in-store growth from our merchants, it remains strong. we obviously don't -- we don't disclose the exact numbers, but i would say it's a strong double-digit growth for our merchant base year on year even through this gradual normalization.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks a lot. thank you all for your questions. and on behalf of ofer, nir, myself and the entire global-e team, i would like to thank you all for joining today and for your continued interest in global-e. i would also like to take this opportunity and thank our growing list of merchants around the globe for their ongoing trust and partnership.
finally, i would like to thank our super dedicated and passionate team of employees around the globe, who strive tirelessly every day to fulfill our vision and make the future of global e-commerce truly border-agnostic. goodbye, all. take care. and we very much look forward to speaking with you again on our future earnings call.

amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, erica, and welcome, everyone. today marks our third quarter as a public company and our first q4 reported one. this is an exciting chance to reflect on what an unbelievable year we've had. we finished the year with the strongest quarter in the company's history, continuing our consistent trend of delivering growth and strong execution against our ambitious targets.
during today's call, we will review our q4 and full 2021 results, update you on the exciting developments going on in the business and provide guidance toward what we expect to see in 2022. starting with q4 results. i could not be prouder of the global-e team for producing yet another record quarter despite the tough year-on-year comp as we lapped last year's covid-impacted holiday period. for the first time in our company's history, we surpassed $0.5 billion in quarterly gmv, with $505 million generated in the quarter.
together with our stronger execution in the previous three quarters, annual gmv summed up to $1.45 billion in 2021, delivering more than 87% growth versus 2020 gmv. revenues followed a similar trend with $82.7 million of revenues in q4 and $245.3 million for the full year, delivering roughly 80% year-on-year growth in 2021. thanks to our growing economies of scale and our continued focus on operational excellence, we managed to continue improving our gross profitability margin, which in q4 reached 39.5%. as a result of the top-line growth, coupled with the scale average, we more than doubled our gross profit in 2021, reaching $91.4 million compared to $43.5 million last year, delivering 110% year-on-year gross profit expansion.
we continue to reinvest across our business as we rapidly scale up. but as always, we do it in a thoughtful and highly efficient manner, maintaining our cash-generating model with an adjusted ebitda margin of 14.3% for q4 compared to 13.5% in q4 of last year and 13.2% for the full year of 2021, up from 9.2% in 2020. we continue to witness an immense and growing market opportunity ahead of us across all regions and market segments we operate in. interest in our services remains as strong, if not stronger than ever.
and we believe the effects of the covid pandemic on merchants' priorities and decision-making processes is largely permanent. as we mentioned in the past, we do expect the gradual normalization of e-commerce growth rate to continue over the coming quarters as the impact of the pandemic wears off and shoppers around the world increase the percentage of their spend in physical stores. it is also worthwhile mentioning that given our scale and the strategic relationships we have with a variety of logistics service providers, coupled with the fact that merchants tend to prioritize direct-to-consumer over other channels, to date, we have not witnessed any meaningful impact from supply chain challenges or merchant inventory shortages. over the last quarter, we continued launching with many more incredible brands and continued expanding our relationships with prominent retail groups.
during the fourth quarter, we launched with yet more brands from the lvmh group. this time, fenty beauty and fenty skin, rihanna's cosmetics brands. yeezy-gap, kanye west's much-discussed fashion cooperation with gap, also launched with us during q4, as did the fast-growing sports clothing brand, nvgtn. during the quarter, we also expanded our relationship with several of our merchants, serving more and more lanes for them.
among these, we can mention cartier; stussy; suunto; the french brand, the kooples; and the spanish footwear brand, camper, all of which added additional key lanes to be operated by globally. in addition, the german audio equipment brand, sennheiser, added the u.s. one of its largest destination markets to be operated by global-e, continuing our growth in the exciting new vertical of consumer electronics. besides our strong momentum in the markets we already operate in, namely north america, the u.k.
and continental europe, we also continue pursuing our geographical expansion efforts. we expanded our team on the ground in tokyo; established a partnership agreement with the japanese global digital transformation leader, trans cosmos; and now also have our first team member on the ground in melbourne, australia, with the first reputable aussie merchant already signed. on the strategic partnerships front, our joint efforts together with shopify to deliver the new native integration remain on track. we recently met additional important milestones in the technical development road map and are gearing up toward general availability of the new integration once we complete the pilot phase.
all the while, we continue to onboard new shopify-based merchants of various sizes on the existing third-party integration. as a matter of fact, some of the new brand launches i mentioned earlier, such as fenty beauty, yeezy-gap and nvgtn are all shopify-based, as is the remarkable direct-to-consumer healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand, figs, which is the latest shopify-based enterprise merchant to launch with us just a couple of weeks ago. i'm also happy to let the fans of the u.k.-based formula one racing team, mclaren, know that you can now order your favorite merch, regardless of where you are in the world, as mclaren recently implemented global-e's offering on their headless shopify-based online store. finally, i would like to give you the latest update on the strategic acquisition of flow commerce we signed in q4.
we closed the transaction early in q1 this year, welcomed the team into the global-e family and immediately went full steam ahead with integrating flow's team and capabilities into global-e. the motivation for the acquisition was our strategic wish to better support emerging brands as well as be able to provide our solutions to channels in white-label form. as such and based on flow's technology, we recently established a new channels and emerging brands division. the division's first priority is to complete and launch the first channel partnership agreement, which is already signed with shopify and on which, work is well underway by the former flow tech and product organization, augmented now by personnel and know-how from global-e's teams.
in addition to pursuing various other white-label channel opportunities, the new division is now in the midst of formulating its new go-to-market strategy and productizing additional aspects of our branded offering, taking into account global-e's know-how, scale and expertise in order to ensure we deliver the best experience for the world's emerging brands. we expect this strategic work to continue over the next couple of quarters as we gear up to launch this exciting new offering toward the end of the year. in parallel to our strong push into the channels and emerging brand space on the back of our flow commerce acquisition, looking ahead to 2022, we first and foremost plan to continue leveraging our clear market-leading position to continue our accelerated growth across north america, the u.k. and continental europe, in all of which the market is still very much greenfield.
as in the past, this will include signing up new merchants, expanding our relationships within brand groups and operating additional lanes for existing merchants, leveraging both our ultra-efficient direct sales channels and our growing list of strategic partnerships with the likes of dhl, shopify, klarna, facebook and others. in addition, we plan to continue investing into building our offering and presence in the apac region, both directly and through local strategic partners such as the australia post group. while we expect our existing markets to continue exhibiting fast growth well into the future, given the large untapped potential in the region, we do expect apac to start gaining a meaningful part in our activity mix in the coming years. on the product side, over the last quarters, we welcomed many new members to our expanding global r&d team as we continue to reinvest into product innovation and the building of new capabilities as future growth levers.
over the course of the coming year, we plan to continue adding more localization capabilities to the platform with emphasis on further developing the granularity of our multi-local support features. furthermore, we expect some of the value-added services we are piloting with, such as demand generation, for example, to move toward full-scale deployment throughout the few next quarters, providing merchants of all sizes with yet another layer of differentiated services and support for the growth of their cross-border business. during 2022, we also plan to begin a few additional pilots of our new managed services offering toward a full launch next year. 2022 started well both in terms of activity and in terms of new business coming in.
and we are optimistic regarding what this coming year has in stock for cross-border d2c in general and for us in particular. as ofer will describe in more details in just a few minutes' time, we are guiding for strong gmv and revenue growth of 70% in 2022 at the midpoint of the range, representing our strong market leadership position and the vast and long runway that lies ahead of us. with the conclusion of our first decade of operations already in sight next year, we believe we are literally just at the beginning of this exciting journey as we continue our relentless focus on flawless execution, on operational excellence and above all, on delivering exceptional, consistent and long-term value to all our loyal merchants. the future looks bright with tremendous opportunities for long-term growth ahead of us, and we very much plan to continue seizing them effectively and efficiently as we have done to date.
and with that, i will hand it over to ofer, our cfo, to go over our financial results in more depth, as well as provide more details regarding our outlook toward 2022.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, amir, and thanks again, everybody, for joining us today for our quarterly earnings call. we are very pleased that we ended 2021 with another strong quarter of fast growth as we continue to execute well on all fronts. i'd like to point out again that in addition to our gaap results, i'll also be discussing certain non-gaap results. our gaap financial results, along with the reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap results, can be found in our earnings release.
as amir mentioned, our rapid growth in gmv continued in q4 as we generated $505 million of gmv, an increase of 66% year over year. while growth of the overall e-commerce market is showing signs of normalization, we continue to benefit from the large and fast-growing direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce market opportunity. in q4, we generated total revenues of $82.7 million, up 54% year over year. service fees revenues were $35.5 million, up 73%, and fulfillment services revenue were up 43% to $47.2 million.
the higher growth in service fees revenues compared to fulfillment services revenue was driven by the continued growth of our multi-local offering and the mix of merchant volumes generated on our platform in q4. throughout 2021, our existing merchant base continued to stay and grow with us, as reflected in our annual ndr rate of 152% and gdr rate of over 98%. at the same time, we continue to see significant contribution of gmv and revenue from the new merchants that have launched with us during 2021. we have continued to experience higher-paced growth in our u.s.
outbound revenue as our strong momentum in the u.s. continues. in 2021, u.s. outbound revenue was up 108% year over year.
as amir mentioned, our gross profit continued to outpace top line growth as we continue to improve gross margins, leveraging our scale and improving efficiencies. in q4, gross profit was $32.7 million, up 82% year over year, representing a gross margin of 39.5% compared to 33.5% in the same period last year, also affected by the higher share of service fees revenue. we continue to put efforts in leveraging our scale as we strive to further improve our efficiencies. moving on to operational expenses.
we are committed to continue investing in the development and enhancement of our platform to further strengthen our current offering and support new initiatives -- the new initiatives amir has mentioned. r&d expense in q4, excluding stock-based compensation, was $8.4 million or 10.2% of revenue compared to $4.6 million or 8.7% in the same period last year. total r&d spend in q4 was $10.3 million. we also continue to invest in sales and marketing and cultivate a very healthy and growing pipeline while maintaining high levels of efficiency.
sales and marketing expense, excluding the amortization expenses related to the shopify warrants and stock-based compensation, was $6.7 million or 8.1% of revenue compared to $3.6 million or 6.8% of revenue in the same period last year. shopify warrants-related amortization expense was $29.4 million. including this, expense sales and marketing expenses for the quarter totaled $36.7 million. general and administrative expense, excluding stock-based compensation and one-off flow transaction-related expenses, was $5.8 million or 7% of revenue compared to $2.6 million or 4.8% of revenue in the same period last year.
this expense reflects the impact of additional expenses related to being a public company, including our d&o insurance policy costs. total g&a spend in q4 was $7.8 million. adjusted ebitda totaled $11.8 million, representing a 14.3% adjusted ebitda margin, increasing from $7.2 million or 13.4% margin in the same period last year. net loss was $22.5 million compared to a net income of $4.3 million in the year ago period, a direct outcome of the amortization expense related to the shopify warrants.
net profit excluding the amortization expense related to the shopify warrants was $6.9 million. switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. we ended 2022 with $509 million in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities, prior to the closing of the flow transaction. we continue to generate cash with operating cash flow in the quarter at $24 million compared to an operating cash flow of $33 million a year ago.
moving to our financial outlook and guidance for 2022. as you will see, the guidance reflects the strength and the continued momentum of the business. for q1 2022, we are expecting gmv to be in the range of $446 million to $456 million. at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 69% versus q2 of 2021.
we expect q1 revenues to be in the range of $74.5 million to $76.5 million. at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 64% versus q1 of 2021. for adjusted ebitda, we are expecting a profit in the range of $0.7 million to $1.7 million. for the full year 2022, we anticipate gmv to be in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.5 billion, representing nearly 70% annual growth at the midpoint of the range.
revenue is expected to be in the range of $411 million to $421 million, representing a growth rate of 70% at the midpoint of the range. for adjusted ebitda, we are expecting a profit of $38 million to $42 million. our outlook for 2022 reflects the impact of the flow acquisition, which in 2022 is still expected to generate negative adjusted ebitda as well as additional investment in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing and product development. in conclusion, we believe that the opportunity ahead of us remains massive and that we are well positioned to capture it.
we will continue to execute on all fronts to drive strong top line growth while leveraging economies of scale and continuing to generate cash. we are gearing ourselves up in order to continue to create value to our merchants and to accelerate our business momentum. and with that, amir, nir and i are happy to take any of your questions. operator?

will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi guys, good afternoon. congrats on a nice quarter. i was hoping i could ask a question about how you're thinking about the opportunity with shopify over kind of the longer term. and i'm wondering about how you're thinking about what's the lowest-hanging fruit once the full integration gets off the ground, the partnership really starts ramping.
i mean, when we look at shopify volumes today, there's a significant amount of cross-border volume on their platform already. so i guess when you look at that opportunity, are you more excited to penetrate the existing cross-border activity that's already on the platform? or is it the merchants with no cross-border footprint that you guys are excited to actually start for the first time and enable cross-border? and i'm sure the answer is both, but i guess i'm just curious on how you think about the opportunity for the two different opportunities. thanks.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you for the question. it's nir debbi. first of all, we're very excited looking forward to the general availability of our native integration for the enterprise product on shopify platform. for this product, we are aiming and focusing our efforts on merchants that currently have cross-border activities, most of them.
as typically, this would be larger merchants already trading well and trading cross-border as part of it. looking further into the future, as part of our enhanced, i would say, partnership with shopify related to -- also on the -- to the flow acquisition, we do expect to support many more smaller merchants. many of them are -- would be new into cross-border activities.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. appreciate it. and just maybe one on margins.
i wanted to ask about the fulfillment side of the business. i guess the implied take rate on fulfillment came down again, and i assume that's largely a function of the multi-local offering that you discussed, i think, this quarter and last quarter. and a lot of the outperformance this quarter came from the services side of the business. so i was wondering if you could maybe talk about expectations for fulfillment revenue growth relative to services revenue growth, and related, how to think about gross margins as we traject through the year.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes. hi, it's ofer. thank you for the question. as you said, service fee take rate has increased to over 7%, while the decrease in overall take rate was the result of the decrease in the fulfillment take rate.
and as you mentioned, one of the main drivers for that is the expansion of our multi-local offering for which we typically do not provide fulfillment services as the model is largely based on local shipping. however, the mix in q4 also affected the take rate as it was biased toward higher average order value merchants. we expect going forward for the multi-local offering to continue to expand. however, we don't expect the same mix effect in the coming quarters.
and i think that is reflected in our guidance, which reflects an overall take rate of approximately 16.7%.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. appreciate you taking my questions guys. thank you.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thanks will.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette
thanks. i wanted to talk about acquisitions. and i guess, within acquisitions, how much are you contemplating flow will contribute this year? and how should we think about its impact on the overall p&l, including profitability? and as part of that, what are you looking at for incremental acquisitions? are there opportunities? and then i have a follow-up.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
i will start regarding the guidance and the financials. it's ofer. basically, flow is integrated into our guidance, and they do represent over 5% of the top line. however, they are weighing on our adjusted ebitda, mainly in the next two, three quarters as flow's adjusted ebitda is not positive yet.
we expect that to improve over time as we leverage our scale and efficiencies, but basically, that's the impact on the next few quarters. and regarding the higher-level question, i will pass it to nir.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you, james. so basically, looking into the future, we do expect that in the next quarter, we will be focused on integrating flow as part of the global-e offering, building, i would say, the bridge of flow into the emerging brands' native support of shopify as well as enhancing their capabilities toward better support for smbs. we expect this to, i would say, heal the growth and momentum looking forward as of 2023 onwards. so we do have high expectations for the acquisition.
however, it will take us a few months to, i would say, align it in terms of r&d investment needed to get the platform geared for, i would say, high-base growth.
james faucette
great. and then separately, you announced, here on the call at least, incremental brands from lvmh, sennheiser kind of taking over their operations in the u.s., etc. when you think about the growth algorithm for this year and into next year, how much should we be thinking about weighting between new geographies, new brands and then just incremental services and capabilities that you're looking to roll out?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
so as you've seen from the numbers that ofer spoke about, we've seen in 2021 more than 150% net dollar retention, which means our merchants actually staying with us and growing with us. we expect it to continue going into 2022. so a considerable component of our growth would come out of existing merchants continuing to grow with us. some of it is the organic growth.
some of it is opening more lanes, as you mentioned in the examples now. but i would say the majority of the growth from, i would say, new gmv would come out of signing new merchants. we have a very, very robust pipeline, which continues to develop. we see it across our operations in u.s.a., continental europe, u.k., now also building up nicely in asia pacific.
and we expect in terms of new gmv, a lot of it to come from new bookings.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and james, this is amir. i would just add on the back of that, that, as we mentioned earlier, we see very much of the opportunity in those markets that nir mentioned, the u.s., continental europe and the u.k., to be still very much greenfield. so although, as we've already mentioned, we are investing a lot of efforts and attention into growing into the apac region, we do expect the majority of the activity over the coming years to still come from our existing territories as they continue to grow very fast.
james faucette
that's great. thanks amir, thanks nir.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of samad samana with jefferies. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. great to see the strong finish to 2021. i wanted to ask the flow question slightly differently. i guess, i know you guys gave a specific revenue level when you announced the acquisition.
so i was hoping for a more specific amount that you're assuming for 2022. and then could you tell us if flow was growing at the same rate, better or slower than globally on a stand-alone basis?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
going into 2022, as we advised in the acquisition, we expect flow to contribute to the growth, i would say, in line with the ge internal growth. i think with some of the focusing and building and focus on the r&d, the internal growth of flow should be a bit lower than global-e itself but not materially different. so this is our expectation. for 2022 onwards, we expect that to accelerate as a division once everything is deployed, i would say, later this year and especially looking into 2023 onwards.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe, ofer, just we're about halfway through the calendar quarter. and i definitely appreciate that the company gives guidance. could you help us maybe understand what you're seeing in terms of gmv seasonality for brands that have been with you for a while? just are we seeing kind of normal seasonal gmv trends for established merchants? just any color you can give halfway through the first quarter from a seasonality perspective.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes. i think in terms of seasonality, we're seeing a standard quarter if you compare it to previous quarters, to the previous two or three quarters. however, as we mentioned, and i think this is very obvious, there is some normalization in the overall growth of e-commerce, and that is also evident. since we are able to add a lot of new logos to our platform and also execute on land and expand, basically, we were able to generate very high growth rate.
but the overall market is normalizing as the physical stores are reopening, and there is going back to the traditional balance.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of brian peterson with raymond james. please go ahead.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
hi gentlemen. i'll echo my congrats on the strong close to 2021. so i wanted to hit on some of the sales investments. it looks like sales and marketing doubled year over year in 2021.
i know that's going to be an incremental investment area going forward. maybe help us understand, stack rank, where are those two or three incremental investments going? and how much or how productive are those today in terms of driving new merchant growth? or is that going to be more felt in 2022 and 2023?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
sure. thank you. brian, it's nir, and thank you for the question. yes, we did invest quite a lot in sales and marketing versus what we did the previous year.
however, we are still below the 10% mark in terms of spend on sales and marketing out of revenues. however, the growth that we've seen have gone toward, i would say, two main focuses. one of them is establishing a spearhead into new territories. we have people on ground in tokyo, japan, building the pipeline and cultivating our relationship with our strategic partner on the ground, trans cosmos, as well as -- as well, investment already in australia.
in parallel to it, we've seen the market opportunity and the ability to capture higher growth, as we've seen in the states, which is growing more than 100% for us. so we are doubling up our teams in order to enjoy the momentum. so it's an expansion across our core and gravity center, as well as establishing a spearhead in different locations in the world where we define the high-opportunity markets. we intend to continue and invest in that going forward but at a pace that will not be dramatically different in terms of the spend on sales and marketing out of revenues.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
and then maybe just a follow-up on that. if i think about the investments that you're making in australia or japan, how do we think about the ramp? i know it's early days, so maybe this is an unfair question. but just thinking about when those markets could make material revenue contributions. thanks guys.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
sure. i think that we would see gmv ramping up considerably in asia pacific as of 2023. but we do expect to see already gmv this year. so we have the first man on the ground in melbourne, and on the back of it, we have the first reputable brand out of australia already signed and expect it to contribute already as of late q2.
and we expect more to come within that year and launch within that year. most of the effect would come only in 2023 because they will launch later in the year, so most of the effects will come later in the year. however, we do see a lot of the investment already bearing fruits as our bookings went considerably up through 2021 versus 2020. and this is part of the push and momentum we have into 2022 planning and results as a lot of the growth would come from clients already signed with global-e.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. and i would add on that, brian, that we're coming in kind of strong into these markets, not just with our teams on the ground but also with a couple of strategic partnerships that we've already signed and are already operating. so we expect that to also be a force multiplier in our ability to ramp up quite quickly in these regions.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
great to hear that. thank you.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thanks brian.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of koji ikeda with bank of america. please go ahead.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. hi amir, hi nir. thanks for taking my question. i had a question on guidance here.
so over the past few days, we've recently heard some other e-commerce companies where maybe the outlook was a little bit less certain. and here you are with confidence giving '22 guidance, not only confidence giving it but really a nice number here at 70%. so wanted to dig in a little bit on what you're seeing out there, hearing out there from your customers that is giving you all that confidence to give a '22 guide right now.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. so thank you for the question. this is nir. basically, we have seen with our clients, giving priority into investment in direct-to-consumer cross-border.
and we've seen it with multiple of our clients, opening more lanes and investing more in penetration into new geographies, which expected to continue going into 2023. in parallel, 2021 was a record year for us in finding new business and new logos in, and a lot of this effect would come into play only in 2022 and would contribute to this accelerated growth. we do see, as we spoke about in previous calls, a lot of the effects of covid that are here to stay. so the need for brands and the desire to go direct to consumer was accelerated through the pandemic, and this state does not change.
there might be certain relief with shops being open. however, the trend of brands, especially larger brands, moving into a direct-to-consumer on a global basis is not stopping, and we see it in our pipeline. and this gives us, i would say, quite a lot of confidence building our planning into 2022 and onwards.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. thanks for that commentary. and i wanted to ask you a question on net revenue retention.
152% here in the fourth quarter or for the full year for '21. and that's really off the back of a very strong pandemic, 172%. so i guess looking for some commentary. you don't have to give the exact numbers, but how should we be thinking about net revenue retention driven by customer cohorts pre-2020 versus customers that were maybe brought onto the platform more recently in 2021 and later 2020?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
i think that, generally speaking, we see that the newer cohorts coming in a bit stronger compared to the previous cohorts. however, when you take a bird eye's view at it, as we previously said, we don't expect the pandemic figures to be the stable figures for the future. we do believe that if you look at our pre-covid averages, we will be able to achieve that. so we don't think that we will hit 170% or 160% or 150% every year.
however, we are confident that we will have strong ndr numbers moving forward.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler. please go ahead.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, should i say good evening? i wanted to go back to the optimism around gmv growth here. you're guiding to $1 billion of incremental gmv. even if i assume 5% of that is tied to flow, it looks like organic gmv growth could be well north of 60% again.
and so just as we think about the levers to growth, how much of this is just the luxury channel you're addressing that is really strong versus it sounds like there's some new logos that are driving the optimism? just could you double-click a little bit more into the optimism here? maybe is there a big chunk of contribution coming from shopify? or do you think this is largely going to be kind of organic as you think about the construct of that gmv optimism you're guiding to here? thanks.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you, brent. this is nir. basically, our optimism is based on, i would say, the robust pipeline of new logos we see on the one side, which brings with it very large brands wanting to do cross-border and use also our multi-local offering across multiple geographies. and in parallel to it, we have a great pipeline of land and expand.
we have discussion ongoing and advanced discussions with large brands already operating on our platform, looking to expand their operations with us. and add to it the organic growth of our clients that even from -- as ofer mentioned, from previous year's cohorts still growing very nicely. and the combination of all three levers actually bring us to a point where we do believe that even organically, as you mentioned, the 60% mark is a reasonable target for 2022.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
it sounds like demand is there, for sure. go ahead, amir.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. no, i just wanted to add that i think the -- in addition to that, we put a lot of efforts and attention into also keeping the gdr high. so if you couple the growth of the existing and new cohorts with the fact that churn rates remain sub-2% consistently over quite a few years now, that is the other side of the growth algorithm keeping -- making sure that our merchants remain very happy with the results that they're seeing and stay with us for the long term.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
great to hear there. and then my last follow-up here for ofer. we do have some new mechanics as we think about the take rate, shopify, flow. should we assume these newer partnerships should be slightly lower take rates, same take rate, higher take rate? just trying to think through the take rate assumptions as we start to ramp up some of these -- the flow contribution and shopify contribution.
and the wild card there would be the mix of multi-local, but just trying to understand the take rate assumptions for those two channels going forward. thanks.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes brent, thank you for the question. basically, looking -- starting from the bottom line, i think that we are expecting in 2022 solid take rate at around 16.7%. and we don't expect the mix to change significantly. the current shopify business or the shopify partnership that we already had before the flow acquisition, this tends to be at a very similar take rate to our overall average.
and again, putting aside the multi-local, which we mentioned a few times, we don't expect any additional impact on the take rate in 2022. going forward into the future, once the flow offering will develop and start gaining traction, that will have some impact. and we do expect lower take rates on that offering, but it will take -- still take a few quarters until we see the impact of that.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
very helpful color there. thanks again for the call. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have next question from the line of scott berg with needham. please go ahead.
john godin -- needham and company -- analyst
hi guys. this is john godin on for scott berg. thanks for taking my questions. first, just on the flow platform.
just curious if you guys could kind of frame up the opportunity over the next couple of years between expanding flow's reach more internationally compared to kind of the increased go-to-market capabilities and accelerating penetration that can help you drive in the u.s.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you for the question. it's nir. basically, we expect that flow would first deepen our partnership with shopify as part of the acquisition we signed, as we announced an additional extension of our partnerships, allow us basically full access of flow platform to support additional elements of the shopify-native cross-border solution. and we expect that to give us access to many more smaller emerging brands and a new segment we're not really focused on with our current solution.
and this will also enable us to accelerate our smaller merchants solution with, i would say, a quicker deployment time and ability for a more productized approach than the global-e current enterprise platform. so overall, we expect it to, as i said, increase our footprint into additional verticals. a lot of it would come, as you stated, out of the state, but we believe that we are going to roll it out over the next couple of years on a global scale.
john godin -- needham and company -- analyst
great. and next, just wondering if you could talk about europe specifically a little bit, highlight maybe any of the demand trends you're seeing there. i'm curious if you're seeing some kind of an additional migration of companies who previously were not operating in europe on your platform now migrating on given the vat changes. thank you.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. we do continue to see an increased demand for our services. as the complexity of trading cross-border in general continues to increase, it's not only the change in europe with the ioss. regime now applies also to cross-border sales, not only the distance selling within europe.
but -- and i can say it because we just did a summary for our clients recently. there were more than 30 changes in regulation cross-border only in the last 12 months across different markets. so this, over time, convinces merchants that the time it takes to adjust the investment and the know-how of how to do it efficiently does not make sense doing it in-house, and we see more interest coming our way out of that. in europe, specifically, based on the ioss, we do see more interest from cross-border retailers looking into how they can leverage globally and avoid the need for registration as well as enjoy additional capabilities related to international duty drawbacks and other, i would say, more complicated processes that global-e enables.
john godin -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thanks guys.
operator
we have next question from the line of josh beck with keybanc. please go ahead.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. maybe i'll just ask a product-focused one. it certainly seems like multi-local has progressed really nicely. you talked about expanding some of the localization capabilities.
so maybe just stepping back, can you give us some sense of how widely adopted the product is today and maybe over a multiyear time frame, how to frame up where it could head?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. so the product is already well developed in terms of multi-local, and it allows us to support already the two very large brands, jabra and sennheiser, and not only allow to support them. it allows us to also increase, i would say, and take additional chunk and substantial chunk of their business, such as the u.s. recently being allocated to us from sennheiser.however, we do plan and we continue to invest highly in making it available in additional markets.
so we continue to roll out additional legal entities, additional operational and logistics setup in different markets. we are launching next month our first merchant out of the gcc region, working out of uae with support out of the free trade zone, as well as support for mainland dubai. and we continue this with the men on the ground now in singapore, as well as other locations in the world. so we do invest heavily and continue to deploy it.
on the back of it, we add additional local couriers ability to support localized return in additional parts of the world, as well as local payment methods and services for those specific domains. so we -- i would say that the product itself is developed. however, the rollout for it has much more local specifics than the regular cross-border approach. and we are -- based on the demand we see from clients, they are rolling out additional services and geographies.
operator
thank you. we take the last question from the line of pat walravens with jmp securities. please go ahead.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you. congratulations. amir, can we very briefly recap the conversation we had over breakfast in tel aviv about the durability of this model? in particular, like large brands can't just roll out in every market with you at one time, right? they have to do it over a period of years.
can you just talk about why that is?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, pat. it's not that they can't. theoretically, they can. and to be honest, some of them do.
it's more a question of choice, and in many cases, kind of their internal setup. so as we discussed when we met in tel aviv, typically, the kind of small- and medium-sized brands will basically roll out the entire world in one go. the bigger brands typically do put in place kind of a gradual rollout plan. and sometimes, it's because they have local representatives or local distributors in certain markets where they want to run these contracts off before they internalize these lanes.
in other cases, they have local setups on the ground of their own. and they first want to start with the markets where they don't have such setups and later on as they progress, roll out these markets as well. but there are always exceptions. and i think on the previous call in the previous quarter, we mentioned alo yoga, which went live with us, which is a big enterprise merchant.
and they went live with all markets in one go. so it's really -- there's nothing inhibiting them structurally from doing that. it's more a matter of choice and strategy on a per-merchant basis.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. and i'll bet a lot of people in israel celebrated when you did that with alo yoga.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
absolutely. thanks, pat.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and i'd now like to turn the call back to amir schlachet for closing remarks. over to you, sir.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer

so kudos to all of you. goodbye all, keep safe, and we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls.

amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, erica, and welcome, everyone. the strong results in q1 of 2022, our fourth quarter as a public company, which we will be reporting to you today, reflect our continued strong execution capabilities in spite of certain macro headwinds. we will also take this opportunity to update you on our current outlook for q2 and for the full year of 2022. but before i turn to our results, i would first like to take this opportunity and send on behalf of the entire global-e team, our regards and best wishes to our dear ukrainian colleagues and their families, who have been undergoing tremendous hardship for the past few months ever since russia invaded their country.
we did and continue to do whatever is in our par to help our colleagues. i'm happy to report that all of them are safe and sound. and together with them, we very much hope that this war will come to an end soon. turning to our q1 results.
we continue to experience fast growth. gmv and revenues came in very close to the top of the outlook range at $455 million and $76.3 million, respectively, representing 71% year-on-year growth in gmv and 65% growth in revenues. at 39.1%, adjusted gross profitability was well above the 33.3%, which we achieved in q1 of 2021 and stable compared to the previous quarter. as such, our adjusted gross profit grew 94% year on year, outpacing our strong top line growth.
as always, we continue to prioritize growth while ensuring that we achieve such growth in a healthy and sustainable way, keeping a positive adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda for the quarter came in at $3.3 million, well above the top of the outlook range, which was $1.7 million. however, it was slightly down from the $5.2 million in the same quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of the flow acquisition as well as the incremental costs associated with being a public company. demand for our services continues to rise.
and during the quarter, we continued to capitalize on the huge market opportunity that lies ahead of us. all throughout the quarter, we continued launching with many great brands. first and foremost, i am excited to share with you that we went live with adidas, one of the world's biggest and most prominent global consumer mega brands. as some of you may know, last year, the leadership team of adidas laid out a new multiyear growth strategy with online direct-to-consumer, or d2c, being one of its strategic center pieces.
we are proud and deeply honored to have been selected by adidas to take part in their global online d2c journey, utilizing the benefits of our platform and capabilities. as part of this partnership, 16 markets are already live and trading, including markets that are operated using our advanced multi-local offering. additional markets are planned to be rolled out gradually over the coming quarters. in addition to adidas, we launched with many more exciting brands across all the geographies and verticals we operate in.
when it comes to high street brands, we went live in q1 with several leading u.s. brands. including brooks brothers, ralph lauren, r.e.m. beauty by ariana grande and rare beauty by selena gomez as well as with prominent u.k.
brands, including space nk and dover street market, to name just a few. in france, we went live with leading fashion brand sezane, and we also went live with our first ever belgium brand, buissonniere. finally, as our apac footprint continues to expand, we went live this quarter with the famous brand of esprit, selling out of hong kong. all in all, new merchant launches are running at full steam ahead.
as year-to-date, we have launched nearly twice the number of merchants we have launched in the same period last year. besides new merchant launches, during q1, we also expanded our relationships with multiple existing merchants who opened new markets during the quarter, such as celine or the healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand figs as well as food duty brands, which added 20 additional markets and the french retailer la redoute, which added several key european markets. during the quarter, we also continued to strengthen our strategic relationship with the luxury group lvmh with three new maisons signing up to our services, all of whom are expected to go live during 2022. switching gears, i would like to take this opportunity to give you an update on several aspects of our strategic partnership with shopify.
on the direct solution front, i'm happy to report that, as planned, and thanks to our deep collaboration with shopify's commercial and technical teams, our new native integration emerged out of pilot phase last month and became generally available for all shopify advanced and shopify plus merchants. we are already seeing promising initial traction with a double-digit number of new merchants who are in active integration using this new technology. in parallel, the development of the white label merchant of record, or mor solution, based on the technologies we acquired as part of the flow commerce transaction remains on track. on shopify, the first channel to utilize this new service candidates for the first few alpha phase pilots have already been identified.
we are expecting to start live testing in several weeks' time, and we are planning to commence a more elaborate beta testing phase before the end of the year. while on the subject of the flow acquisition, i will also add that the post-merger integration process is nearing its completion with most former flow team already fully integrated into the corresponding globally ones and with many of the planned synergies and scale efficiency efforts already beginning to be realized. with flow's platform now part of globally and benefiting from our scale and know-how, we are able to provide an unparalleled range of solutions for all sizes of merchants from emerging smbs all the way up to the world's largest mega brands. finally, during the quarter, we continued to invest in further strengthening our growing ecosystem of strategic partners.
we rolled out our partnership with the australian post group, extending our support for australian brands. in addition, we expanded our highly successful partnership with klarna to also cover canada, a key market for both of our companies. together with canada, klarna's buy now, pay later options are now offered on the globally checkout in 15 markets. in summary and to reiterate what i opened with, we are pleased with the very strong results of the first quarter of 2022 as we remain on track, both financially and strategically in line with our long-term targets.
looking into the future, our conviction in the market potential is as strong as ever. we have a fully backed high-quality pipeline and a record number of prospect deals of more than $10 million in gmv each with the business firing on all cylinders going live with new merchants at record pace. nevertheless, in the short term, we are faced with somewhat heightened levels of uncertainty in the macro environment impacting the year-on-year growth of our existing merchant base, mainly in europe. in terms of the direct effects of the russian-ukraine war on our levels of activity, shortly after the fighting broke out, we had to discontinue our service to russia due to the sanctions imposed by the international community as well as to ukraine given the logistical challenges as a result of the fighting.
in total, russia and ukraine account for less than 2% of our gmv. in addition, as i mentioned, some of our colleagues reside in ukraine. but as a matter of fact, to date, most of them have been able to continue working with only limited impact on productivity. in terms of indirect impact, during the first few weeks of the war, we have seen a significant reduction in sales to several central and eastern european markets such as poland and the czech republic.
demand from this region somewhat picked up later, but many of these markets are still trading significantly below normal levels. these ce markets typically represent 4% to 5% of our gmv. furthermore, we see some impact of the macro environment on consumer sentiment also in additional countries, mainly in western europe. our guidance for q2 gmv presents strong year-on-year growth of 53% at the midpoint and takes into account such macro headwinds as well as the fact that q2 last year was strongly positively affected by covid-19.
our guidance for q2 growth is lower than our full year expectations due to typical seasonality tilted toward the second half of the year as well as the fact that the majority of the large merchant launches that are planned to take place are at or after the middle of the year. we have taken these factors into consideration also in our updated full year top line guidance for 2022, which, at the midpoint, reflects fast growth of 61% in gmv and 60% in revenues, a slight reduction from the previous guidance. however, we reiterate our previously established 2022 adjusted ebitda guidance of $40 million at the midpoint, given the resilience and agility of our business model. we have high conviction in our ability to maintain a high growth pace while uploading -- upholding adjusted ebitda levels and cash generation.
and with that, i will hand it over to offer our cfo, to go over our financial results in more detail and provide more additional color regarding our outlook for q2 and the full year of 2022.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, amir, and good afternoon, everyone. we continue to grow fast and demonstrate strong execution on all fronts. the demand for an acceptance of our direct-to-consumer cross-border offering by merchants is stronger than ever with new signings and onboarding of new merchants continuing at a record pace. while consumer sentiment, particularly in europe, is impacted by the war in ukraine and the shifting macro environment.
our rapid growth in gmv continued in q1 as we generated $455 million of gmv, an increase of 71% year over year. while growth of the overall e-commerce market has softened, the shift of merchants toward direct-to-consumer is accelerating and the cross-border opportunity remains massive. in q1, we generated total revenues of $76.3 million, up 65% year over year. service fees revenues were $31.9 million, up 87% and fulfillment services revenues were up 53% to $44.4 million.
the higher growth in service fee revenues compared to fulfillment services revenue was driven by the continued growth of our multi-local service and the revenue mix of flow. we have continued to experience rapid growth in our u.s. outbound revenue as our strong momentum in the u.s. continues.
in q1, u.s. outbound revenue was up 111% year over year, driven by strong growth on the global-e platform, coupled with the high share of u.s. outbound on the flow platform. our non-gaap gross profit continues to outpace top line growth.
in q1, our non-gaap gross profit was $29.9 million, up 94% year over year, representing a margin of 39.1%, compared to 33.3% in the same period last year, driven by the continuous leveraging of our scale and the higher share of service fee revenue. i would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the fact that this quarter we are starting to report a new metric of adjusted gross profit, which adjust the gross profit for amortization of acquired intangibles as is common post acquisition. gaap gross profit in the first quarter of 2022 was $27.2 million. moving on to operational expenses.
before we dive in, it's important to note the impact of the consolidation of flow, which is driving an increase in operational expenses as a percentage of revenue as flow is still at a lower scale. we continue to invest in the development and enhancement of our platform to further broaden and strengthen our platform's capabilities. r&d expense in q1, excluding stock-based compensation, was $12.5 million or 16.4% of revenue, compared to $5.2 million or 11.3% in the same period last year. total r&d spend in q1 was $17.7 million.
the increase of r&d expense as a percentage of revenue is mainly driven by the flow acquisition. we also continue to invest in sales and marketing and generate a very healthy and expanding pipeline while maintaining efficiencies. sales and marketing expense, excluding shopify warrants related amortization expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation, was $8.2 million or 10.7% of revenue, compared to $2.9 million or 6.2% of revenue in the same period last year. shopify warrants related amortization expense was $36.7 million, increasing due to the flow-related warrants.
total sales and marketing expenses for the quarter, including shopify warrants and related amortization expenses, were $49.6 million. general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and acquisition-related contingent consideration, were $6.6 million or 8.6% of revenue, compared to $2.1 million or 4.6% of revenue in the same period last year. the contingent consideration expense reflects the portion of the flow transaction consideration, which is held back for the founders and contingent upon a certain employment period and expensed over time. total g&a spend in q1 was $11.5 million.
adjusted ebitda totaled $3.3 million, representing a 4.3% adjusted ebitda margin decreasing from $5.2 million in the same period last year, reflecting the impact of flow as well as incremental costs associated with being a public company. as we've mentioned on prior earnings calls, we expect flow to weigh on our adjusted ebitda for the next two, three quarters as flow's adjusted ebitda is not yet positive. during q1, we have started to realize operational synergies, improving the cost structure of flow, and we will continue with additional initiatives in the coming months. turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements.
we ended the quarter with $278 million in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities. net operating cash flow used in q1 was $6.9 million, compared to net operating cash flow used of $20.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. moving to our financial outlook and guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022, as amir described. for q2 2022, we are expecting gmv to be in the range of 495 to $505 million.
at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 53% versus q2 of 2021. we expect q2 revenue to be in the range of 82.5 to $84.5 million. at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 46% versus q2 of 2021. for adjusted ebitda, we're expecting a profit in the range of 2.8 million to 3.8 million.
for the full year of 2022, we anticipate gmv to be in the range of 2.28 to $2.40 billion, representing a 61% annual growth at the midpoint of the range. revenue is expected to be in the range of $383 million to $403 million, representing a growth rate of 60% at the midpoint of the range. for adjusted ebitda, as amir mentioned, we are reiterating our previous guidance of 38 to $42 million. in conclusion, we believe that while there are macro headwinds, our execution remains strong on all fronts as we continue to talk on the massive opportunity ahead of us.
we will continue to drive strong top line growth while leveraging economies of scale and continuing to generate cash. we continue to create great value to our merchants and enable them to develop and grow their direct-to-consumer cross-border business. and with that, amir and i are happy to take any of your questions. operator?

[operator instructions]. the first question is from will nance with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to start off on some of the macro headwinds that you guys called out.
and maybe, first of all, if we could get kind of more of a housekeeping item. i think a lot of investors have been focused on the outbound exposure that you guys talk about, the combined exposure to europe. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the inbound exposure into europe, just to get a sense for what the exposure is to kind of direct consumer demand within europe? and then related, like to take a step back, when you look at the revised guidance for the year, could you talk a little bit about the conservatism included in that guide? and how to think about risk to the downside or to the upside for the remainder of the year as it relates to uncertainty in europe?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
[inaudible]. it's nir. in terms of inbound proportion of europe for globally, we're trading q1 at approximately 30% -- a bit shy of 30% of our business is inbound into europe. within it, cee region, as ofer mentioned, is around 4%, 5%.
and russia and ukraine together is -- was prior to shutting it down a bit sub-2%. so total around 30%. russia and ukraine are completely shut down. cee suffered a significant reduction in -- which we consider temporarily in conversion rates and the rest of europe, we do see some decline, geopolitical and also consumer sentiment combined.
for the second part of your question related to our guidance, i would refer it to ofer.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, nir. i would just add regarding europe that -- although there are some similar trends between different markets in europe, they do not all behave the same. so for example, as we have seen some decrease in spain, italy, and france, but the u.k., on the other hand, has been increasing in volume. so there's also diversification between the different countries.
regarding the guidance, we try to stay realistic with the guidance. we do believe that there is a certain probability that we may hit the previous numbers. however, we think that the current guidance reflects our realistic targets, and we believe that taking into account the current macro environment, these are the numbers that we think we can achieve.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you. and then maybe as a follow-up, just on the shopify going to general availability.
could you talk about any of the progress as that's gone live and maybe what you guys are expecting for contribution from that channel for the remainder of the year?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. so basically, shopify general availability, we are already in integration with a few dozens of merchants that are going to use this integration within the next quarter. and we expect this to continue and ramp up as we deepen our relationship with shopify training the sales team on the product as part of the general availability. we do have additional developments that were phased out into the next quarter and the quarter following it.
but we do believe we will see a continued momentum coming out of shopify. so we did see growth with shopify after signing exclusivity. last year, it was on our classic integration, and we do expect it to continue and grow now that we went into general availability on the native solution itself.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. appreciate taking all my questions.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president

the next question is from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i wanted to ask really quickly, just building on the last questions. can you give us a little bit of input as to -- as you're trying to be conservative especially on europe, what you've actually seen versus what you anticipate could happen there? and i guess, are you anticipating a similar type impact potentially even to the u.s. channels?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
basically, as nir said, we have seen a decrease across the board in cee countries. and we have seen a general trend of a decrease in continental europe. and basically, we haven't seen any impact in other large markets, the likes of the u.s., australia, canada and some of the others trading -- we have been trading well into those countries. and looking forward, and this is what is baked into our guidance, we are taking into account that the micro environment will not be great in the next few months to say the least.
and we -- that is baked into our guidance. and basically, that's it. we are looking at euro. we don't anticipate europe to pick up significantly.
we did see some good signs in early may, but we don't know if that's something that will stay with us. and we are conservative regarding other markets. however, we didn't bake into the guidance a decrease in other significant markets.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then as far as the mix goes, it looks like at least versus our estimates that service revenue was certainly better than we thought, whereas fulfillment was a little bit less. and obviously, there's a margin benefit that you're describing there. but how should we think about that going forward? with service benefiting from flow, that makes sense and making sure that gets incorporated.
but are there additional levers that you should expect or could contribute incrementally to service versus can you describe a little bit what's happening on fulfillment and how we should be thinking about that as a contributor this year?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you for this question, james. i think that this is -- the answer is very similar to what you have been hearing from us in previous calls. we have been developing the multi-local solution, and we are happy that there is engagement from mega brands such as adidas that we have just launched recently, and we have a multiyear plan with them, and we hope and believe that is the count contribute a lot in the future.
and basically, with the multi-local as you know, it is service fee based. we typically don't do the fulfillment. there are some minor cases in which we also supply the fulfillment. but in most cases, it's only service fee driven.
so we expect that over time, we will see higher share of services. however, it will be a gradual pickup as you have seen in previous quarters.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks for that color.

the next question is from samad samana with jefferies. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. maybe just on the guidance side, i am curious, are you -- what are you assuming for net revenue retention from existing merchants.
and maybe how has that trended? and is that what is the bigger part of the guidance reduction? or are you seeing a delay in go-live activity as well? maybe help us think about the guidance in that context?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
hi, samad. thank you. it's nir. on the net dollar retention, we still see a very healthy trend in line with our, i would say, historic numbers, historic averages and also with our long-term target so above the 130% on net dollar retention.
in terms of the gross dollar retention, we do see, i would say, same trend as we've seen before, which is considerably sub-2% in terms of churn, which is a very strong, i would say, performance as well. looking into launches and new merchants, i think we see a super positive trend. as our q1 bookings of new business, new gmv is virtually more than double what we did in q1 last year and overall internal budgeting for the quarter. so we do see a tremendous interest from clients to integrate, to go d2c, and this does not stop because of, i would say, covid really because of macro environment, even the other way around, we see some acceleration there.
in terms of launches, we don't see delays that are caused by the situation. we did, as amir mentioned earlier in the call, we launched double the numbers of merchants than what we did same period last year. so we do see this as a continuous trend of more clients signing in and more clients pulling live each and every quarter. so all in all, on the customer front and the underlying business and long-term growth engines, we do feel very comfortable.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, ofer, maybe one for you, just. globally -- sorry, flow closed almost right at the beginning of the quarter. how much did that contribute to both gmv and revenue in the quarter?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
as we communicated around the closing or the signing of the deal, and as we expected, flow contributed about 5% to the top line gmv and revenue.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
and then if i could just squeeze one -- a quick one in. the company has had a history of generating positive free cash flow. i'm just curious maybe given the shopify warrant amortization and near public company costs, just how should we think about maybe free cash flow for 2022? thank you for taking my questions.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes. so free cash flow, generally speaking, should be similar to our adjusted ebitda. it should be very close. there could be some fluctuations between quarters, period ending and so on.
but generally speaking, it should be closely tied. we did have a one-off investment as we move to new offices. so there is, i would say, an investment that i think it would be approximately anywhere between $5 million to $8 million, but we don't expect any additional significant investments. so all in all, if you put that aside, it should be pretty close to adjusted ebitda.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.

the next question is from koji ikeda with bank of america. please go ahead.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
just another one here on the guidance. just wanted to make sure i heard this properly. so in your answer to one of the previous questions, you mentioned -- i think you mentioned you didn't bake any guidance, a decrease from the other significant markets out there. just kind of curious, did i hear that correctly? and maybe what are you seeing in those other significant markets? what are you hearing from the demand environment or from the customers that is giving you the confidence that those markets are going to remain healthy for the rest of the year?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question. it's ofer. basically, what -- the way we looked at the macro impact and the wages reflected in the guidance, we took into account that it will be a challenging environment in the -- that least until the end of the year. and that is baked into the guidance and reflected in the different markets.
some of them, the impact is more significant as we mentioned, like in europe and in others, it's less significant. however, the fact that we will have a bumpy macro until the end of the year is reflected in the guidance.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. i did want to switch the topic of conversation away from guidance for a bit here and ask you about adidas. obviously, a big win for you guys, huge brand, many different global websites. i think in the press release, you mentioned 16 markets live now.
i know that adidas is in a lot more markets they sell into right now all over the world. so just curious, can you talk a little bit about the sales process with adidas and maybe what was the key value prop that was instrumental to winning that deal? thanks, guys.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
i think that basically, what we've seen and i don't want to speak specifically about adidas, but they are part of the answer. we've seen very large global brands looking to strengthen the b2c cross-border or multi-local, but the global strategy is going d2c and going d2c e-commerce. it was accelerated in covid, but it's an underlying trend that started before and is now just moving at a faster pace and not slowing down because those shoppers are moving much more online, and it allows the brands to have a direct connection to the shoppers wherever they are in the world, if they want as a brand, to own that relationship to present the brand as they wish to present the brand and enjoy the data of the consumers. they need to transact with them directly.
and this is where globally it's in, especially with our multi-local offering where we can allow the brand to transact domestically, a global brand like adidas has presence virtually almost everywhere in the world. but we allow them to transact domestically from a local inventory but use globally as a merchant of record to simplify the process of taking over the direct connection to the client while enjoying the ownership of the client and the ownership of data in order to better serve the clients and better learn is our needs. and this is -- we see it as a trend. we see many more large brands in the pipeline, which will mature in the coming quarters.
so this is a trend we expect to continue and see.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. and i just want to add on that, i think what adidas and other brands like them see is that they can -- by working with us, they can enjoy basically the best of both worlds. they can, on the one hand, enjoy a solid field-proven platform like ours with all the different services and components. and on the other hand, it's highly configurable and we are able to tailor the specific characteristics and configurations and behaviors on a per market basis and contribute from our know-how and best practices on local trading in each market.
so that is very synergetic for them that combination of a solid yet highly configurable product.

the next question is from brent bracelin with piper sandler. please go ahead.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for taking my question here. good evening, i guess early morning. i wanted to circle back on multi-local. obviously, great to see adidas embrace the platform, but a little surprised that, that brand and that size is going with what is really a relatively new product for the company.
it begs the question how much broader interest is there in multi-local. and so can you just answer this, how many customers are using multi-local today? and as you look out over the next three years, is this a niche product? or do you think this could be a mainstream product that a large portion of new and existing customers could use? thanks.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
brent, thank you for the question. i think we need to look at it on a twofold. on the one hand, if you look at the number of clients, we don't expect to see a large number of clients using multi-local because, in essence, this offering is for very large brands that has presence in multiple geographies and regions. it's much more geared toward the larger global brands as well as consumer electronics brands that are multi-local.
so in terms of number of clients, we don't expect it to be a significant portion of the number of clients. in terms of the size of the client and the portion of gmv, we do expect it to grow considerably as we expect to onboard very large clients into that offering. so we reported in the previous quarters about jabra selecting to use this solution, about sennheiser, both from consumer electronics, we do have other clients from the apparel that are using it. adidas now has joined them.
we do have a couple more very large brands in pipeline that are expected to use it in the next quarter or two. so we do see it picking pace in terms of gmv, and we do expect it to take a more significant portion out of our gmv and not just as a niche.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. so think of multi-local as really a new product for the largest mega brands out there, very clear. ofer, i wanted to just follow up on the guidance. and part of the question here is just inbounds we're getting from investors.
as we think about the revised guide, you're going from a midpoint of 70% gmv growth for the full year to 61, which is still a pretty ambitious kind of growth rate. so i guess as we kind of break that out, what's driving the optimism? is it just the doubling of merchants? is it the expectation that shopify really starts to kick in the second half? is it the pipeline opportunity of some large mega merchants that's giving you the optimism. just trying to understand if you've put in a conservative enough assumption relative to kind of same-store sales versus these other offsets? thanks. 
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question, brent. i think that the way we look at it is that the merchant demand side remains very, very strong. it's even -- it's not -- it's even strengthening over time. we see a very strong demand from merchants.
again, we mentioned adidas that's one example, but merchants are going direct to consumer and merchants are going cross-border. and basically, we are supporting them on that journey, and this is continuing. so on the execution front, we are seeing very good results in terms of sales, in terms of onboarding, everything is working very well and the numbers look great. the softness is in the consumer sentiment in some markets.
some of them are larger markets, as we mentioned, in europe, and this is actually what is affecting us. so we do feel very confident in the execution, in the relationship that we have with existing merchants and the potential of new merchants coming on board based on the multi-local shopify and all the other engines that we currently have and we are developing. and the reduction in the guidance is driven by the consumer sentiment and the macro environment.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
just to add to that, brent, i think despite reduction, we are looking at, as you stated, a very high growth plan for the year at around 60-plus percent for gmv. a lot of it is based on very large merchants already signed and midsized merchants that are already signed, and we expect to roll them out in the coming quarter and a lot of them into -- supporting into our peak trading, which gives us, i would say, the benefit of enjoying the holiday season with them on board. as we mentioned previously, we more than doubled our signing in q1, and we expect that also to translate into launches within the second half of the year as well. so the combination of what we already have signed and the robust pipeline, we do believe that this will translate into a very strong second part of the year, which will allow us to meet our budget.

the next question is from pat walravens with jmp securities. please go ahead.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you. ofer, maybe to start, if i'm doing my math wrong, you were right. i mean, if i'm doing my math right, you reduced full year gmv and revenue by 4% on the low end to 7% from the high end and russian-ukraine is less than 2%.
so let's just say it's 2%, that leaves 2% to 5% from the other things. how would you bucket the other things?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
i think the overall reduction is approximately 5%, just a bit over 5%. approximately, a bit less than 2% of it is directly driven by the fact that we stopped servicing russia and ukraine and the remaining 3% is driven by other markets, the macro environment in other markets, mainly europe, but also general softness in the market.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then, amir, for you, with all this uncertainty, what are your top sort of one or two priorities for the rest of the year? what are the things that you have to make sure that you get right for the rest of this year?
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. pat, i think the things we are focusing on are the things we have always focused on is on execution on all fronts and servicing our existing merchants, especially in these times of uncertainty and softness in demand from consumers. our merchants need us at our best. they need us the most.
and so executing on that and supporting them to the best of our abilities is a very clear priority for us. as we mentioned a few times on the call, continuing the rapid pace of onboarding new merchants because that is what's going to determine our results in the second half of the year and definitely looking into 2023 onwards. and in parallel to that, as we have mentioned, we are managing our expenses and managing adjusted ebitda very tightly to make sure that we continue this fast growth pace at a responsible way and make sure that on an annual basis, we continue to generate cash. we believe this is the healthy way to build the business toward the future.

the next question is from scott berg with needham. please go ahead.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. i guess just one for me. i've had a lot of mine asked already.
i want to talk about the pipeline. i think, amir, you had spoken about a record number of greater than $10 million gmv deals in the pipeline currently. i wanted to try to understand if you can comment on that maybe from a geographic location and then are those deals in the pipeline more from new customers or existing customers that are expanding? just trying to understand if there's been maybe a change in what that composition looks like. thank you.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thanks for the question. it's nir. in terms of the pipeline, yes, we do see a substantial growth in the pipeline. a lot of it is driven by larger deals, the over 10% gmv deals.
i think it comes from -- partly from our partnership with shopify, where we see more direct-to-consumer brands, celebrity brands that are coming in with nice sales volumes. we had in the past schemes of concord asean. we have drew house of justin bieber. you see it with others that are coming in or that launched recently with us as the r.e.m.
of ariana grande and real beauty of serena gomez. so part of it related to celebrities direct-to-consumer brands that are fast growing. some of it relates to more traditional brands that are giving much more focus for the d2c such as adidas, we spoke about, such as sennheiser, they decided to do much more with such as suunto for example that is expected to open new lanes with us that are worth quite a lot. so it's, i would say, mainly driven by new business that is coming in with new clients, new logos.
however, we do see some growth, as mentioned, suunto that is expected to open many more lanes, but we see it also with others that should also, i would say, give us another push with large volumes from a single brand.

brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. just one for me. so i'm curious just on the linearity, particularly in western europe, i'd just love to get an update on maybe how that trended through the first quarter and what you've seen so far in the second quarter? and, ofer, i think you mentioned that there were some green shoots in may.
i realize it's kind of an uncertain macro right now, but i'd love to -- can you elaborate maybe on what you saw in may that kind of made you reference that comment?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian. we have basically january traded well. and since the conflict in ukraine started, the war in ukraine and in parallel, all the macro data inflation and so on picked, basically we have seen a reduction. so it started in march in europe, as we mentioned.
and april was very similar to march in terms of trends. and again, may, as you mentioned, it's still early we're just in the middle of the month and we don't know if just a few good days or a trend, but we have seen better numbers in may.
brian peterson -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from josh beck with keybanc. please go ahead.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i wanted to ask a little bit about opex flexibility. clearly, you've cut the top line between 5% and 6%, and you've been able to hold in ebitda. so certainly, that shows discipline.
as we start to think '23 and perhaps softer sustained consumer scenario, is there a level where you're not going to be able to maybe absorb the top line softness and you'd have to kind of reduce the profitability assumptions? just curious how you're thinking about that balance?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
we do maintain a very agile approach and also agility within the organization. and basically for 2022, we do think that based on the synergies that we are already realizing with flow and we will continue to realize in the next few months and the continuous leveraging of the economies of scale that we can sustain that. and also, i would say that we had a ramp-up in h2 of 2021. and now we're sort of also starting to enjoy the people that have joined us.
so we slowed down a bit without any connection to the macro environment. we just wanted to sort of absorb and start enjoying the people that have joined us in the last few months. so this is regarding 2022. going forward, we do keep an agile approach, and we can -- we believe that we can sustain up to a certain level.
and we will plan our expenses accordingly, but we will maintain and we will continue to prioritize healthy growth. so we will continue to invest in any resource that can push growth as long as it's healthy.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. and then maybe just a follow-up, i realized a lot of this is reading tea leaves in some ways. but across your business and customer base, have you seen any notable impacts from some of the supply chain disruptions that have taken place and maybe separate from inflation, just what's happening with reopening and more folks traveling?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
so i think there is -- from the, i would say, mid-2021, there is an impact of reopening, but that was already baked into our guidance. so we do see an impact, but this was part of our planning. so all in all, we see a net neutral effect compared to our planning. but obviously, people are traveling and the world has reopened, and it does have impact generally on e-commerce, but this was already planned.
in terms of --
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
in terms of supply chain, maybe, ofer, i'll take this one. in terms of supply chain, still as we -- i think we discussed it in the previous call and the same holds now, we don't see any impact on us neither direct or indirect from the logistical holdups in supply chains around the world for the fact that, first of all, for us, everything flies in the air. most of the holdups and bottlenecks in supply chains happen in terms of sea freight. so that has minimal effect on us, if any, directly.
indirectly, some of our merchants obviously may be impacted by shortages of inventory, etc. but since the world has talked about supply chain challenges for a while, everybody basically prepared for that and we've seen merchants that have rolled forward inventory orders and made them well in advance before the season. and even if they encounter some levels of limited inventory, typically, there is no impact on our activity because the merchants tend to prioritize the direct-to-consumer channels when there is shortage in inventory versus other channels like wholesale or marketplaces. so again, because we serve their direct-to-consumer channel, which is the most important for them, we do not see any impact of that to date.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to amir for any closing remarks.
amir schlachet -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you. on behalf of ofer, nir, myself, and the entire global-e team, i would like to thank you all for joining today and for your continued support and interest in global-e. as always, i would like to take this opportunity to thank our loyal merchants for their continued trust and partnership and to congratulate all my fellow team members here at global-e on yet another quarter of great execution as we continue to pursue our ambitious long-term goals. bye all, keep safe, and we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls.

greetings, and welcome to the global-e second quarter 2022 earnings call. this call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's website in the investors section under news and events. for opening remarks and introductions, i'll now turn the call over to erica mannion at sapphire investor relations. please go ahead.
erica mannion -- investor relations
thank you, and good day. with me today from global-e are nir debbi, co-founder and president; and ofer koren, chief financial officer. nir will begin with a brief review of the business results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2022. ofer will then review the financial results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2000 -- sorry, excuse me, june 30, 2022, followed by the company's outlook for the third quarter and full year of 2022.

nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you, erica, and welcome, everyone. unfortunately, amir could not join the call today due to the passing of his father. and i would like to start by sending deepest condolences to amir and his family on behalf of the entire global-e team. back in mid-may, when we discussed our q1 results and forward outlook, we mentioned the heightened uncertainty toward q2, resulting from macro-induced factors in the war in ukraine.
however, today, i'm happy to report to you that the initial signs of improvement we saw in early may turned out to be indeed the precursors to further improvement in the second half of the quarter. the russian, ukrainian and belarusian markets, which in total represent less than 2% of our activity, remain closed for the time being, given the unfortunate continuation of the war in the region. however, activity in other regions in europe moderately picked up back from may onwards, despite macro concerns. coupled with our team's continued strong execution, this resulted in our strongest quarter ever.
quarterly gmv amounted to $534 million and quarterly revenues amounted to $87.3 million, both above the top of our outlook range. furthermore, as ofer will elaborate on later in the call, while there remains somewhat heightened uncertainty in the conditions of the global macro environment, we are increasing our previously stated guidance for the remainder of the year to reflect the stronger performance in q2 in the borderfree acquisition. but first, going back to our q2 results, we continue to experience fast growth during the second quarter of the year, with gmv growing 64% year on year and revenues growing 52% year on year. our adjusted gross profitability continued to strongly improve coming in at 41.8%.
our adjusted gross profit amounted to $36.5 million, growing at 77% year on year, again, outpacing our strong top-line growth. this was a result of our growing efficiencies of scale leverage, the continued realization of cog synergies with flow and a more favorable mix of revenues. in terms of our operational expenses, we continue to reinvest in growing the business and building the infrastructure required to seize the huge market opportunity that lies ahead of us. however, at the same time, and given the various macro headwinds we foresaw at the beginning of the year, we continue to exert strict cost control throughout the quarter to ensure our ability to continue delivering healthy and sustainable growth while remaining cash positive.
in addition, we have been able to realize synergies from our recent acquisition of flow commerce faster than expected, thereby lowering the drag on our bottom line. these factors, coupled with our faster-than-planned top-line growth, resulted in a very strong adjusted ebitda of $11.1 million, well above our outlook range, representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 12.7%. switching gears, i would like to update you on some of the many positive developments in our business over the past quarter. on the merchant activity front, demand for our services continues to remain strong as more and more brands around the world put direct-to-consumer and cross-border sales, it's across chairs of the growth strategy.
as such, during the quarter, we continued launching with many new brands and expanding our activity with existing ones. q2 saw the launches of many new brands on our platform, including leading fashion brands, rag & bone and zadig&voltaire. the spanish cosmetics brand, freshly cosmetics, is the official tennis merchandise store of wimbledon and the luxury watches brand, zenith, which is part of the lvmh group. we also continue to add celebrity brands and other fast-growing digitally native brands, such as justin bieber's fashion brand, drew house, the highly successful training apparel brand, nobull, as well as skkn, another brand by kim kardashian, augmenting our successful partnership with kim's clothing brand skims.
furthermore, our entry into the apac region continued to gain strong momentum with the launches of triangl swimwear out of hong kong and ryderwear, our first live australian merchant as well as the signing of our first ever japanese merchant. during q2, we also expanded our activity with brands such as adidas and suunto, all of which added additional lanes to be operated by globally. last but not least, i am proud to announce that during q2, we went live with one of the world's most well-known and respected consumer brands, disney. as part of the push to expand the direct-to-consumer sales, disney chose globally to power its cross-border sales across several markets in the apac region, leveraging both our extensive capabilities and expertise as well as our unique multi-local infrastructure.
as before, we remain highly optimistic regarding our ability to continue growing this portfolio of brands as our new bookings, forward-looking pipeline of brand is stronger than ever. on the strategic partnership front, we have continued to deepen our collaboration with our growing ecosystem of partners around the world, including, for example, our first and highly attended client event in tokyo, japan, held in partnership with our local partner, trans cosmos. our partnership with shopify continues to develop on track. on the direct solutions side, dozens of merchants of different sizes are already live on our new native integration into the shopify platform and dozens more are in various stages of planning and integration.
in addition and as planned, during the quarter, we have already booked our first live order as part of the beta trials of the new white label merchant of record solution on shopify, built upon the flow commerce technology. work on this innovative solution for smbs continues full steam ahead toward a phased rollout later in the year. corporate work on the full post-merger integration of flow commerce into global-e is now all but complete. and as i have already mentioned, we have been able to realize many of the planned synergies earlier than expected.
our corporate development team is now focused primarily on the integration of borderfree, which we acquired out of pitney bowes. this was our second acquisition that was closed at the beginning of q3. with a talented team of software engineers and other professionals from borderfree, all highly passionate about cross-border, now becoming part of their respective teams at global-e around the globe. besides the list of marquee u.s.
brands who work with borderfree and will now have access to globally advanced localization platform, we expect the merger of borderfree into globally to provide several key benefits and synergetic values. first, we expected it will enable us to expedite our planned expansion of both range and the quality of online marketing and demand generation services we provide to our merchants. over the years, borderfree has developed a set of unique capabilities and assets in the field of cross-border demand generation, which we expect we will be able to offer to the much broader audience, merchants on our platform. second, as part of this acquisition, we were also able to strike a strategic mutually beneficial partnership with pitney bowes, providing us with access to some of pitney's advanced logistical solution as well as providing pitney's clients with access to global-e best-in-class cross-border enablement solution.
and finally, some of the proprietary cross-border software components and architectural elements, built by the highly skilled engineering team at borderfree, will be combined over the coming quarters into the global-e code base, yielding a best-of-breed set of services and considerably shortening the time to market of various elements, which were on our technical road map. as ofer will elaborate on later, we do expect the borderfree acquisition to somewhat weigh on our margin during the next few quarters given the differences in financial profiles and efficiencies. but as with the flow acquisition, we should be able to utilize both our scale and our expertise in order to gradually realize relevant synergy and potentially improve the financial margins over the coming quarters. there are many more exciting developments happening across the business.
while we continue to leverage our position as the world's leading cross-border enabler to capture more and more of the immense and growing market opportunities that lies ahead of us and to help our fast-growing list of merchants to realize our international sales potential. but in the interest of time, i will pause here and just say in summary that we are very pleased with our strong results in the second quarter of 2022 and remain very much on track both strategically and financially to achieve our 2022 and long-term goals. and with that, i will hand it over to ofer, our cfo, to go over the financial results in more detail and provide some additional color regarding our outlook for q3 and the full year of 2022.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you, nir, and good morning, everyone. this has been a record quarter on all fronts as we continue to demonstrate fast growth and strong execution, coupled with cash generation amid the macro environment, which continues to be volatile. the demand for an acceptance of our direct-to-consumer cross-border offering by merchants continues to be very strong with signings of new merchants continuing at a record pace. our rapid growth continued in q2 as we generated $534 million of gmv, an increase of 64% year over year.
after experiencing weaker consumer demand through march and april in central and eastern europe and in some of the western european markets impacted by the war in ukraine and the macro environment, we have seen significant recovery through may and june. while the overall e-commerce market growth in the first half of 2022 has been softer, merchants are continuing to prioritize and accelerate the shift toward direct-to-consumer and the cross-border opportunity remains massive. in q2, we generated total revenue of $87.3 million, up 52% year over year. service fee revenue were $39.3 million, up 86%, and fulfillment services revenue were up 33% to $48 million.
service fee revenue continued to grow faster compared to fulfillment services revenue, driven by the growth of our multi-local offering, merchant revenue mix in the quarter and the revenue mix of flow, which is characterized by a higher share of service fees. from a geographical standpoint, u.s. outbound revenue continued to grow rapidly. in q2, u.s.
outbound revenue was up 104% year over year, driven by strong growth on the global-e platforms u.s. outbound business coupled with the high share of u.s. outbound on the flow platform. in addition, our penetration efforts into new markets are starting to show initial positive results.
while still relatively small in share, apac and the middle east outbound revenue have grown 213% year over year. our non-gaap gross profit growth yet again outpaced top-line growth. in q2, non-gaap gross profit was $36.5 million, up 77% year over year, representing a margin of 41.8% compared to 36% in the same period last year. as nir mentioned, this was primarily driven by the higher share of service fee revenues, the realization of flow cost of goods sold synergies and our increased scale leverage.
i would like to remind you that as of q1, we are reporting adjusted gross profit, which adjust the gross profit for amortization of acquired intangibles as is common post acquisitions. gaap gross profit was $34.3 million. we expect borderfree to weigh on our gross margin in the next six to 12 months until we are able to realize the available cost of goods sold synergies. moving on to operational expenses.
throughout the quarter, we continued to invest in the development and enhancement of our platforms to further broaden and deepen the global-e enterprise platform capabilities and to develop the new smb offering on the flow platform. r&d expense in q2, excluding stock-based compensation, was $12.3 million or 14.1% of revenue compared to $5.5 million or 9.6% in the same period last year. total r&d spend in q2 was $17.6 million. the increase of r&d expense as percentage of revenue is mainly driven by the consolidation of flow.
alongside r&d, we continue to invest in sales and marketing, enabling us to generate a strong and diversified pipeline while maintaining efficiencies. sales and marketing expense, excluding shopify warrants-related amortization expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation, was $8 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $4.3 million or 7.5% of revenue in the same period last year. shopify warrant-related amortization expense was $37.4 million. total sales and marketing expense for the quarter were $51 million.
general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related contingent consideration, were $6.3 million or 7.2% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 5.7% of revenue in the same period last year. as a reminder, the contingent consideration expense reflects the portion of the flow transaction consideration, which is held back for the founders, contingent upon a certain employment period and expense over time. total g&a spend in q2 was $15.1 million. adjusted ebitda has increased significantly compared to the previous quarter, driven by higher-than-expected top-line growth, faster-than-planned synergies realization with flow and additional focus on cost management discipline due to the macro volatility.
adjusted ebitda totaled $11.1 million, representing a 12.7% adjusted ebitda margin, increasing from $7.6 million in the same period last year. we have realized synergies that have driven a significant improvement in flow's adjusted ebitda, and we now expect flow to reach breakeven by the end of this year. turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. we ended the quarter with $285 million in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities.
net operating cash flow generated in q2 was $31.9 million compared to a net operating cash flow of $6.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. moving on to our financial outlook and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022. we expect q3 gmv to be in the range of $600 million to $614 million. at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 72.4% versus q3 of 2021.
of this, borderfree is expected to contribute $50 million to $54 million of gmv. we expect q3 revenue to be in the range of $99.5 million to $102.5 million. at the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 70.9% versus q3 of 2021. adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of $8.5 million to $11.5 million.
please note that borderfree's take rate in q3 is expected to be similar to global-e's take rate, while borderfree's adjusted ebitda is slightly negative. as nir mentioned earlier, we are increasing our previously stated outlook for the remainder of the year to reflect the stronger performance in q2 and the borderfree acquisition. for the full year of 2022, we now anticipate gmv to be in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion, representing 72.5% annual growth at the midpoint of the range. of this, borderfree is expected to contribute $125 million to $135 million of gmv.
excluding borderfree, we are raising our full year gmv guidance to $2.32 billion to $2.42 billion. revenue for the full year is expected to be in the range of $406 million to $426 million, representing a growth rate of 69.6% at the midpoint of the range. we are also increasing our full year adjusted ebitda guidance, which was previously at $38 million to $42 million, and now we expect it to be in the range of $41 million to $46 million, despite a slightly negative contribution from borderfree. in conclusion, while macro headwinds continue, our execution remains strong on all fronts as we continue to tap into the massive opportunity ahead of us.
we will continue along with our partners to further enhance our offering to enable merchants to grow their direct-to-consumer cross-border businesses effectively and efficiently. we believe this will enable us to continue demonstrating fast top-line growth while leveraging our scale to further improve efficiencies. and with that, nir and i are happy to take any of your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of will nance with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. condolences to amir. sorry to hear about that.
i wanted to ask a question on the recovery on some of your markets in early may that seem to have continued throughout the quarter. wondering if you can talk about some of the trends that you guys have seen more recently or that you may be expecting in the back half of the year, maybe tie that together with the guide? i assume that there's some incremental fx headwinds that you're having to absorb with the updated guidance as well. so maybe when we just think about the guidance of exporter free for the remainder of the year, how are you thinking about the puts and takes of macro fx versus some of the strength that you guys have seen more recently in the second quarter? thanks.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
hi. hi, will. it's ofer. thank you for the question.
as we've communicated, this year has been quite volatile. after we've seen a weaker march and april, we did see business pick up in may and june, partially due to the fact that we've seen some of the markets coming back, mainly in central, eastern europe and some of the european markets that were affected from the war and the macro environment. so not everything came 100% back, but we did see things picking up. and then we've seen a lot of merchant activities, putting a lot of focus on direct-to-consumer, both existing merchants that have been pushing their business forward, and we've seen a lot of new product launches and marketing activity during may and june.
and as we continuously communicate, we have a very strong pipeline. so we've seen merchants launching the new activities with us. and all of that is accumulated into a strong may and june. and then when we looked at the guidance, on the one hand, we incorporated the q2 results, obviously, that's already history.
and on the other hand, we did take into account that, one, there is still high volatility in the market and some macro uncertainty. there may be some fx headwinds, but some of it has been a bit eased in the last few weeks, so it remains to be seen what will happen. and basically, that's what we baked into the updated guidance, which reflects the better-than-expected q2 and the addition of borderfree.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe if i can follow up on just a question about how you're thinking about demand for cross-border e-comm. given all the commentary so far this earnings season about the return of cross-border travel that -- it seems like the expectation is that will continue to be strong and recover nicely over the next, call it, over the remainder of the year.
how you guys are thinking about the interplay of people traveling cross-border more frequently and how that would impact the demand for kind of online cross-border e-commerce?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yeah, i think that when we went into our q1 already and in the guidance we gave for 2022, we baked in some covid relief as we assume that people will go back to traveling in 2022. so this was already included in the number, as we expected some localization there. however, we do believe that the longer-term trend that started, i would say, more than a decade ago and still continues of e-commerce, especially cross-border e-commerce growing much faster than physical commerce and growing in share over the entire retail sales will continue, and we do see this trend of growth. global e-commerce is still growing even within covid relief, the growth in e-comm is still positive on a global scale.
so we are quite optimistic about that. when we take it into our new bookings and looking into merchant interest into d2c here, we see a substantial increase. and this trend continues, and it's reflected in the growth that we see in new bookings coming in and with large, i would say, brands and enterprises that are partnering with us to support the future rollout of global d2c.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. understood. appreciate you taking my questions. nice results this morning.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of josh beck with keybanc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you, team. and my condolences as well. i wanted to ask about a broader trend that we've seen in e-commerce. i think the message from a lot of these companies this quarter has been somewhat of a normalization toward 2019 levels when we think about the pace of e-commerce penetration gains within the broader market.
obviously, you have new customers, which are certainly helping drive growth, new corridors as well. when you think about this broader macro trend across customers and verticals, how are you trying to contemplate that into the guidance? and also just thinking about algorithm in the future years as well.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
josh, thank you for that. it's ofer. i think that obviously, all the trends that you mentioned are out there, and we have seen a softer e-commerce environment. the reopening is there, as nir mentioned and so on.
and there are some uncertainties regarding the macro environment. however, i think that what differentiates us is the fact that the direct-to-consumer channel is in the focus of the merchants and is gaining share over other channels. so this channel is definitely growing and growing in a nice pace. and we believe that this is a secular trend that will stay for us for a long time as merchants prioritize this channel for a reason.
they want the close relationship with the consumer, they want to have the data, and they want to enjoy the margins at the end of the day. i think this is what differentiates direct-to-consumer cross-border from the sort of general e-commerce market.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful. maybe just a follow-up on one of the borderfree synergy demand. could you help us maybe understand how applicable you see these types of capabilities across your merchant base something they've really been requesting? also, anything you can share on the revenue model. i assume this gets bucketed under the services business, but would be curious to learn more there.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
hi, josh. this is nir. so when we made the acquisition of borderfree, what we looked for was certain synergies as well as capabilities that we bought. so one you mentioned demand generation is something that over the last couple of years, we started to develop based on demand from our merchants.
as we have a much wider merchant base that have grown very fast with us and over time, became, i would say, very local in many markets, they are looking to how can they accelerate more the growth. and for that, we mentioned is important and to do it efficiently in a time where demand generation becomes, i would say, more problematic due to a different privacy and regulation related to privacy. we believe that there is a place for us to take, i would say, a more proactive approach there. what borderfree has and developed over the year is a unique asset related to demand generation that we believe that we can build on as a base to offer it to all our broader merchant base and to build on in order to fuel their and our current store sales.
so we do see a very high potential there. the other thing we looked at the acquisition was a partnership with pitney bowes, allowing us access also to, i would say, sophisticated logistical services into certain markets, especially into canada, which is a key market for u.s. brands as well as a partnership on the merchant side, giving borderfree -- giving pitney bowes larger client base access to a globally advanced logistical -- advanced localization services. we also believe that we will be able, as we did with flow to realize synergies coming out of our expertise and scale enjoying, i would say, a better profile on the financial side as well.
hopefully, that answers your question.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
perfect, nir and ofer. very helpful.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of samad samana with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my qusetion and congrats on the strong results. maybe first, just with the strong rebound that you've seen in terms of demand, can you help us maybe understand, ofer, what you're thinking in terms of the net retention number for your existing customers? like what's assumed in the revised guidance, especially the exporter free guidance for the year?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
hi, samad. so as you know, we are not disclosing a number on a quarterly basis. however, as we communicated in the previous quarter, we do believe that the ndr would be around our historical levels, not the numbers we have seen in 2021 and 2020 but something around the average of the previous years. and this is what our plan is based upon.
and so far, i think we've been -- after revising the guidance in the previous quarter, things have been on track to get there.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and nir, maybe one for you. have you seen any change either an acceleration or pull forward or maybe a little more hesitant in terms of what customers are doing in go-live times or the length of sales cycles just -- in either direction, have you seen any change in merchant behavior that informs your outlook for the rest of the year?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
sure. then basically, to be honest, we've seen the other way around. we've seen much more interest coming in and a lot of it from larger brands that, i would say, stayed on the fence before related to go direct to consumer on a global scale. i would say the recent example we just launched with is disney, where we are going to support our merchandising store out of apac, a few markets in apac in this phase.
but we've seen many others that are doing the same. our new bookings over the quarter is significantly higher than last year and significantly higher than what we had. i think it was a record quarter for us in new bookings. so it gives us, i would say, some confidence related to our outlook into the rest of the year and further down from there.
hopefully, it answers your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
definitely. thanks, again, and great to see the strong results.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of koji ikeda with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, everyone. please give amir my best. nir or ofer, a couple of questions from me. so just kind of asking on the guidance.
i know on the prior call, you really called out and in the prepared remarks today, you called out russia, ukraine, belarus, central and eastern european softness. that was really kind of the premise of the guide down in the gmv last quarter. but it really sounds like central and eastern european has improved. so just curious, really kind of want to hammer down from a geographical perspective, are the assumptions kind of from the previous guide from a geographic impact perspective, are those assumptions the same within the updated guidance today or are there any other regions to call out?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
so thank you for the question. it's ofer. i think that regarding the geographical effect in the guidance, i would say that we have seen the markets that were directly impacted from the war with some -- also some additional impact from market -- from macro conditions. those have improved, not necessarily to 100% but improved very much during q2.
and basically, we expect them to continue the same or at a similar pace throughout the year. unfortunately, people get used to everything, including war. so we think we saw a drop, then we've seen partial and nice comeback, not to 100%. and basically, this is what we are taking into account in our guidance.
other than that, we have seen some strengths and weaknesses in different geographies, but nothing out of the ordinary. i mean there is always some dynamic during the year.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
however, we need to take into account there are high uncertainties in the macro environment, and this we also took into account into our guidance.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. thank you. and then just one follow-up from me.
i wanted to ask a question on disney. clearly, a fantastic win, the global mega brand. so i was wondering if you could walk us through how this win with disney came about. was this a disney asia division win or maybe was this something more hq-driven with asia being the first target market with maybe more to come? thanks, guys.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yeah. so asia is indeed, i would say, as we see it and also disney, a part of a larger, i would say, approach with phase 1, a deployment into certain markets in apac. on the back of a success on those markets, we do expect a rollout into additional geographies, not only within apac. so it's a discussion that has been going on for quite a while, as you can assume, disney is a reputable brand, the level of project management and requirements to go live was extensive.
and we do believe that over time, as we did with many other merchants, large merchants we launched with as well as retail groups, we would see a land and expand also with disney.
koji ikeda -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys. thanks for taking the questions.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
sandy beatty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. this is sandy beatty on for james. i wanted to quickly follow up, apac, obviously, a point of strength for you guys. can you just talk about the demand drivers there, particularly from a merchant perspective just in terms of outbound, how you're thinking about the potential of the region? you have these larger brands that are potentially moving over.
obviously, more organic wins as well. can you just provide a little bit more color there?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yes. so we are at the initial stages of penetration into apac, but we are very, very confident looking at the future as we see the pipeline of new bookings being, i would say, going from strength to strength over the quarters. i recently visited tokyo, japan for the event we had there with our partner, trans cosmos, and we've seen extensive interest from amazing japanese brands looking to go d2c. we've seen tremendous success in our -- in building a pipeline in australia, fueled by our partnership with australia post and the dhl team in australia.
so we do believe that over time, we would see apac taking, i would say, a significant chunk in the mix of corridors of outbound sales from -- so we are -- today, i would say, much more balanced than we used to be years ago, mainly european outbound today were much more balanced with u.s. taking a significant chunk of our activities, we assume that over time, with the momentum we see in apac, apac will take it through.
sandy beatty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then just one on gross margin. it looked particularly strong this quarter.
can you just walk us through some of the upside drivers there just between multi-local mix shift, scale, obviously? and how you're thinking about trajectory on a longer-term basis particularly as you integrate these new acquisitions?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes, so i think you already mentioned the three drivers behind the strong gross margin this quarter, but maybe i can add some color on that. one, we had a good mix in terms of service fees and fulfillment services. so this obviously has an impact on gross margin. two, and this is important.
we have been able -- and i think we've mentioned it a few times to realize cost of goods sold synergies with flow faster than we originally anticipated. so i think toward the end of q1 and the beginning of q2, we already implemented some changes. we needed to wait and see that everything works well, and we are seeing very good results on that end. so we significantly improved flow's gross margins over the last quarter.
and we also had -- as you mentioned, we continuously invest to gain efficiencies based on leveraging our scale. this is something we do on a continuous basis. so i think those are the three main drivers behind the number. in terms of going forward, we will have borderfree weighing a bit on our gross margin.
as currently, the gross margin of borderfree is lower than ours. we think that over the next three, four quarters, we can improve that as we did with flow. and putting aside borderfree, i think we expect to see the same dynamics. we don't expect to have an improvement of 200 basis points every quarter.
however, over time, we do expect to be able to gradually improve our gross margins.
sandy beatty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thank you for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alex sklar with raymond james. please proceed with your question.
alex sklar -- raymond james -- analyst
so following up on some of the earlier answers, questions on the macro. what can you tell us in terms of growth of merchants in your pipeline or demo activity or some other metrics that you're tracking to help put some quantification behind that pipeline strength commentary?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
sure. it's nir. thank you for the question. so basically, in terms of the growth in pipeline, it's from i would say the demo bookings that we've seen a substantial two-digit increase and go throughout the funnel into the signings of new merchants.
and i can tell you that year over year, we are at over 100% growth for the entire half 1 of 2022, and this momentum with and q2 is even higher than q1 on that. so it's a substantial increase in new bookings, i would say, that supports our, i would say, increased guidance into the second part of the year and also support our long-term growth. hopefully, that answer...
alex sklar -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. no, that's great color, nir. and i guess maybe this kind of goes hand in hand, but just following up on the shopify partnership. the native integration launched, i think, early in the quarter.
but what can you tell us in terms of how that played out versus expectations once you have that native integration up and running?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
so we're happy with the adoption of it. and i think we see a tremendous acceptance of friends requesting to go on the native shopify integration. and we are very, very optimistic looking into the future as our partnership with shopify evolves and strengthen. i think we can say we are very appreciative of the product and engineering team as well as the commercial teams in shopify as being on the -- being built and embedded within the checkout requires a lot of much closer cooperation than we had in the past, and they are giving it, and they have a true partner, and we're very happy about the way this evolves.
we do expect next year to have, i would say, hundreds of merchants, new and existing that would go live on this native integration. some of them, as i said, out of our current classic integration, some of them are new, but we do expect it to scale up and improve our launch time on shopify as well as the overall merchant and customer experience.
alex sklar -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of scott berg with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for taking my questions here. i guess, ofer, i do -- wanted to start off with your ebitda guidance for the full year. you had a strong second quarter, obviously, results with the cost controls and the synergies that you mentioned.
but i see that you did not carry through the entire second quarter outperformance into the second half. how should we think about your growth investments here? it looks like you're continuing to invest aggressively in the business. but is there anything new that you've identified maybe in the last quarter or two that would be interesting to note in terms of what the opportunities out there look like? thank you.
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that the main factor that we should add to this discussion is borderfree. borderfree has adjusted ebitda negative, not a large number, but still has a negative impact on the overall result. and this is baked into the guidance.
on top of that, as you mentioned, we were -- in q1, q2, we were controlling costs. we do have some agility in our model, and we did discuss that in the previous quarter. if you remember, we did update our guidance, but we didn't change the adjusted ebitda number for the year. so now after the second quarter, which was a much better than expected, we're still controlling costs, but we are, as you said, also investing so we can support next year's growth and of course, growth in the future as well.
so those would be i think the main points impacting our adjusted ebitda guidance.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
great. helpful. and then from a follow-up perspective, nir, i know you've all discussed a lot on flow commerce and borderfree here today. but as you think about the borderfree benefits that you listed out before, especially some of the services from pitney bowes.
are those benefits starting to impact your sales cycles for your core global-e type of customer or ar those to realize maybe, i guess, in the next year?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
yeah, thank you for the question. i assume we would see most of the benefit only next year as it requires technical integrations and set up. we're in the process of building the processes as well as the tech side of the integration. following it, i would expect it to benefit both winning of new clients with additional service capabilities.
but more than that, it will enable us to offer, i would say, some additional services to current client base i would say, giving a better customer service to their own consumers in different areas. so it would come both ways. but most of it, we would see only in, i would say, i assume early q1 or q2 2023.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
congrats on a strong quarter again, and thanks for taking my questions.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
hello. this is clark on for brent. first question is, over the course of the past eight months of 2022, could you tell me about what you've seen in the different segments or product categories within gmv, whether that was luxury or fashion or cosmetics. are there any segments or product categories that you've seen more stabilization or more improvement sequentially in q2 from q1?
ofer koren -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question. i think that generally speaking, we have seen similar trends within the different segments. however, if i can point out some differences, we have seen slight decrease in sporting goods and sporting wear. i think it relates to the opening up and people going back to work.
so that would be one observation. i think a second observation would be that we have seen the digital native brands and the new brands growing a bit faster than the others. so i think those are the two main observations.
unknown speaker
all right. great. and then second, a lot of questions on the borderfree capabilities being applied to the global-e platform. but i wanted to ask about the inverse.
wondering if you could talk about what you're most excited about or where you see the most opportunity in terms of offering global-e capabilities to take this team borderfree customer base?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
sure. and i think that -- it's nir speaking. given global-e is more than -- is almost more than 10x, i would say, the size of borderfree, we have much more data and know how to optimize the merchant proposition as well as additional capabilities that were not required at the size of borderfree. and once we can bring those into the global-e client -- into the borderfree client base, i would expect to see a nice, i would say, impact on positive conversion rates turning international traffic into more sales than what they had in the past.
so i think we can bring capabilities that could boost current merchant sales on borderfree. we do, of course, already started the journey. we analyzed where we can do, i would say, quick changes with the borderfree engineers and account management team. and over time, we will be able with some additional bills that we are currently doing do much more for the brand.
so we are very excited about that.
unknown speaker
thank you very much.
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you.

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from the line of pat walravens with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you. and let me add my thoughts and prayers for amir and his family. so nir with borderfree [inaudible] more m&a? and if so, what kinds of things are out there that would be interesting? and then maybe also, let me just add on that.
are you finding that some of the smaller companies that might have interesting technologies are running out of cash and are more available than they used to be?
nir debbi -- co-founder and president
thank you, pat. so i would start with the latter. we see more interest of companies that are, i would say, either running out of cash or don't see a very bright horizon ahead of them reaching out to us, either direct or through the third parties looking if we're interested in making additional transaction. so yes, there is interest.
however, when we look at it from the global-e side, we are focusing currently on, i would say, realizing the potential out of the flow commerce acquisition, especially the build of, i would say, the white label solution into shopify. we have a lot of our hands realizing the benefits from the borderfree acquisition. but we are looking ahead. and we might look, i would say, for some tactical acquisition, not on a large scale, if we see that we can, i would say, complement additional capabilities in area of interest.
we spoke about demand generation earlier, but we can see something in an area of interest for global-e, and we look at the time to build it and the investment versus maybe acquiring, i would say, new capabilities and maybe the skills with it at a faster pace, we might consider that.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you, and congratulations on such a great quarter, guys.
