david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to sonic automotive's second quarter 2020 earnings call.
again. i'm david smith, the company's ceo. joining me on the call today is our president, mr. jeff dyke; our cfo, mr. heath byrd; and our executive vp of operations, mr. tim keen.
today, in addition to discussing results for the second quarter of 2020, i also provide an update on trends we saw within the second quarter and into july as well as an announcement on our latest digital partnerships and accelerated expansion plans for echopark. after that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
and for second quarter progress, we continued to see substantial improvement in operating conditions and automotive retail consumer demand. while april was a challenging month that weighed on our -- that weighed on our quarterly results, may improved greatly and we saw a dramatic acceleration in the rate of recovery during the second half of june, with rising consumer demand for new and used vehicles and service repairs in the majority of our markets. limited new vehicle inventory in certain brands drove higher gross per unit, and actions we took in april to manage our used inventory allowed us to take advantage of used vehicle sourcing opportunities, benefiting used vehicle gpu in may and june.
some noteworthy operating improvements sequentially from may to june 2020 include: a 22% increase in new vehicle gpu, a 35% increase in franchised used vehicle gpu; a 16% increase in franchise f&i per unit; a 16% increase in franchise fixed operations gross profit per day; a 32% increase in echopark combined used and f&i gross profit per unit; and a 154% increase in consolidated pre-tax profit.
above all, we remain disciplined in improving our financial liquidity, controlling expenses and enhancing profitability at both our franchise dealerships and echopark stores throughout the quarter. these factors contributed to sonic achieving adjusted eps of $0.64 compared to $0.62 for the second quarter of 2019. on a gaap basis, we reported eps of $0.71 for the second quarter of 2020, including a $0.07 benefit from a nonrecurring tax item.
in addition to eps growth year-over-year, other second quarter operating highlights include: sg&a as a percent of gross profit of 74.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points; total sg&a reduction of $64 million or 22% compared to the second quarter of 2019; echopark revenues of $315 million, which was up 8%; echopark retail sales volume of 13,207 units, up 5%; echopark segment income of $2.6 million, up 52%; and available liquidity of $455 million as of june 30, 2020, an increase from $312 million as of march 31, 2020.
during the second quarter, we continued to improve our operating efficiency, building on our experience -- our experiences during the last financial crisis as well as more recent lessons learned during this pandemic. we are very pleased with the success of these efforts which have enabled us to operate in a much leaner, more profitable manner. through these initiatives, sonic expects to decrease sg&a expenses by approximately $7 million per month or $84 million annualized as compared to pre covid-19 levels. i'd like to emphasize that this represents over 50% of our adjusted pre-tax profit in 2019, indicating tremendous earnings upside as we return to more normalized business levels.
moving on to our operating segments. our franchised dealerships' year-over-year performance reflects the challenges we faced in april and early may as a result of covid-19. during the month of june, sonic experienced a dramatic recovery in new and used vehicles -- new vehicle sales volumes, gross margin and fixed operations gross profit. this recovery accelerated during the second half of the month, well ahead of our previous forecasts. i'm very happy to report that this strong sales momentum has continued throughout the month of july to date.
now turning to echopark. as expected, echopark sales experienced a v-shaped recovery in sales volume and improved profitability as the second quarter progressed. by june echopark had surpassed our original pre-pandemic unit volume forecasts for the month. as noted in our press release this morning, second quarter echopark segment income increased 52%, demonstrating the operating leverage and profit potential of this model. notably, all of our echopark stores were cash flow positive in june 2020, including our tampa store in just its second full month of operation. this momentum has continued into july as more and more guests realized the tremendous value in the pricing, quality and convenience that our echopark stores offer enabling our guests to enjoy a modern hassle-free car buying experience.
moving on to our digital retailing initiatives. as we announced this morning, we are very excited about our historic and strategic partnership with cox automotive and darwin automotive to develop a first of its kind proprietary e-commerce platform and user interface by the fourth quarter of this year. this digital retailing partnership will be key to accelerating our echopark expansion plans. we are dedicated to elevating our online retail guest experience to match the great guest experience our guests have come to expect on site at our franchised dealerships at echopark stores and at echopark.com.
as you can tell, we are very excited about echopark's performance in this challenging environment and believe these quarterly results speak to the strength of this unique business model. echopark continues to outperform our original expectations, demonstrating the revenue growth, operating leverage and profit potential of this brand. further, echopark is a unique and scalable business model that has not yet begun to reach its full potential.
earlier this year, we announced that sonic plan to grow its total revenues to $20 billion this decade. since that time, we have actually revised our original echopark expansion strategy to achieve more rapid growth of the echopark brand. based on echopark's extraordinary success to date and after an extensive review of our growth strategy over the past several quarters, we are dramatically accelerating our expansion of the echopark brand. while we remain committed to managing capital expenditure levels in the short term, the flexibility of the echopark model has proven greater than we originally anticipated.
by capitalizing on echopark's highly trained guest experience center team, our centralized appraisal, inventory and pricing procedures as well as the development of the newly announced proprietary e-commerce user interface, we can strategically and efficiently build out a national footprint by opening new echopark delivery and buy centers in adjacent markets to our existing locations in a very capital efficient manner realizing returns on investment in excess of 55%. by utilizing enhanced online sales capabilities and the next to last mile delivery model, this will allow us to quickly expand echopark into new markets across the country with minimal capital outlays or overhead costs as our customers nationwide will now be able to shop on echopark.com, through our echopark mobile app or on-site at an echo park retail hub location.
based on these expansion plans by 2025, we expect to have a nationwide distribution network, consisting of 140-plus echopark retail hubs and delivery and buy centers, generating over 0.5 million retail vehicle sales annually and $14 billion in annual echopark revenues. the plans that we've announced today are based on internal modeling we've been conducting for the past several months. even by our most conservative models and taking into account the more recent events of covid, we believe these objectives are quite achievable and we have the team and tools in place to execute our plan.
our first delivery and buy center in greenville, south carolina, opened last friday and delivered its first vehicles on monday. progress is well under way for opening in the next several markets and we look forward to providing updates on our progress and results over the coming months.
before we get to questions, i would like to take a moment to express how proud i am of the way of our -- by the way our team continues to focus on meeting the needs of our guests, our teammates and our business partners during these challenging times and beyond. i want to personally thank each of our teammates for all of their efforts and continued commitment to taking care of our guests as well as their dedication to the future of sonic and echopark.
this concludes our opening remarks, and we'll be happy now to take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and your first question is from the line of rick nelson with stephens. please go ahead, sir.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. so one follow-up on this five year plan. quite interesting. 140 distribution points. it looks like in the slide deck, five hubs next year. maybe you could speak to these delivery locations, how many of those you're thinking about for next year and some color i guess around how you're going to tack these markets where you don't have stores.
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey, rick, it's jeff dyke. sure. we're going to -- we'll open 20 delivering and buy centers next year. that's our plan. we'll probably get three to four opened this year. as david said in his opening comments, we opened greenville already last week, and that's going quite well already. we're delivering cars into the marketplace. we're actually using our bmw store and property that we already have there. but we own property for echopark in the greenville market, so we'll put a small facility up there. the great news is as those facilities are really light on rent. maybe an investment of $1 million to $2 million versus a medium sized store that's anywhere from $5 million to $12 million and a big store that's $15 million to $25 million. so we can very efficiently and effectively move into a market.
those delivery and buy centers will do three to 100-plus a month, maybe as much as 500 a month. when you add that to the hubs, our medium store 750 or large store 1,500, it just makes all the sense in the world. it allows us to rapidly move out echopark's brand to medium and big markets across the country, move a lot faster than we had originally anticipated, that's to reach at the 140 unit mark by 2025 and the $14 billion in revenue. so we're very excited about that. the brand is doing very, very well and it's allowing us to go ahead and make these moves.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and jeff or david, how many of the hubs stores do you envision to achieve those plan in having delivery and pickup locations?
jeff dyke -- president, director
so it will -- this is jeff again. it will be 20 delivery and buy centers a year and probably somewhere in the three to five range in terms of hubs a year. we'll attack the bottom half of the us first and then you'll see us start moving into the northern part of the us. but, yeah, three to five hubs a year and around 20 delivery and buy centers a year.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and rick, this is david. and something to -- that is key to understand this model is that our -- if you think about it, our retail hub centers or the big stores are reconditioning centers as well. so they're highly profitable, while they allow us to recondition vehicles, and that's something that's very important.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and do you charge a fee to the consumer to get these vehicles to the market or is that something sonic [speech overlap]
jeff dyke -- president, director
within 200 to 300 miles, right now, there is no fee that we're going to charge the consumer. we'll see -- we'll play that by ear as we move forward and see how that works out. we'll of course look at the margins. it's going to depend on consumer appetite. so we'll see kind of how that works. right now, in greenville we're delivering cars into the market already. there is no charge to that and the margins are good. so we're meeting our expectations already, but we'll play that by ear. we have a lot of time building the model, so we'll see how that works as we move forward.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and do you deliver to people's driveways or they come to a central location and it's...
jeff dyke -- president, director
no, they're going to come to a central location. we're not going to deliver the last mile. that's where you had a lot of complexity and a lot of expense. and so that's just not something we're going to do. we're going to deliver to the neighborhood, so to speak. and so in greenville, right now it's going to our bmw mini store where guests are picking the cars up, but again, we have property right across the street from there and right across the street from carmax where they do a lot of volume in the marketplace. so we'll build something that's quite reasonable in terms of expense there and deliver into the marketplace from our charlotte and eventually in the first quarter our atlanta location.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and rick, this is heath. i think it's important to note that we think there's value in having knowledgeable delivery, right. it's not someone that's driving a truck and dropping off a car and handing the keys and asking for a signature. it is someone that knows the vehicle, can hook up your bluetooth, can give you a full walk-around and a true delivery on a product that's this complex as a vehicle. we think that is a better user experience than someone that knows nothing about the vehicle pulling up and dropping off the car.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and do you anticipate any cannibalization of your existing hub stores as you push into these markets or do you view it as incremental sales?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
we view as incremental sales.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah, it's 100% incremental, rick.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and when you look at -- when you look at most of our sales, existing sales, they're not -- we're purposely targeting markets that are beyond that reach.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. can i turn your slide deck? page 16 talks about maturity of the hub stores and these delivery and buy centers, the types of volume. any updated thoughts as to how long it takes to reach maturity?
jeff dyke -- president, director
so, we were telling everybody that it takes a year to get a store -- or six quarters or so to get a sort to where we feel like it's mature. but they just keep -- we just keep beating all the maturity levels. and so you look at tampa. david said it earlier, it was profitable in the first two months of operation. so, maybe three to four years for profitability and mature volume, something of that nature, but we're learning -- every time we open one of these stores, they keep opening faster, they ramp up quicker. it just seems like we go from zero to 400 cars sort of immediately and then we sort of ramp up over time. i think full maturity is somewhere in the three to four year range.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and something to keep in mind is the tampa store opened right in the depths of covid. so it's not like it open -- i mean, it really kind of opened in the worst time and still became profitable very quickly.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
exciting stuff. thanks and good luck.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
thanks a lot, rick.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of rajat gupta with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. and really appreciate all the details in the slide deck are very helpful. just had a question there on -- just on the sg&a profile here going forward. you've talked about the $84 million expense reduction. you gave us a pro forma eps base. but as you are expanding into this echopark growth strategy going forward with the delivery and buy location, how should we think about the profile of sg&a to gross here in the near term, at least in the initial years of these -- of this expansion plan before they hit majority, the things like marketing dollars or overhead costs or just things like that, like guest experience management centers, appraisals? just curious as to should we be expecting any kind of step-up in expenses here or like how do you -- how are you managing this within the overall cost bucket with the whole company? and i have a follow-up. thanks.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. this is heath. obviously -- and we reported previously, there's always some opening expenses as we ramp up, but we use to indicate there is about $2 million for every store and that's been dramatically less going forward. obviously, the delivery and buy centers will be a lot less than that as well. but what we're finding is, they are ramping up so quickly and as -- if you look at both the models, and echopark is where our growth is. if you look at echopark, it leverages so much better than the franchised stores. and so that $84 million is straight to the bottom line. but as we grow the echopark -- again, with the way that we're doing with the buy and delivery centers, it's not going to, with the leverage of that segment, it is not going to impact materially the number we've given you.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and, rajat, also, the existing echopark stores are performing so well that they will offset the costs of the opening of new stores. so heath's right. the $84 million just drops straight to the bottom line. that $7 million a month in sg&a reduction, you can just -- you could take that -- now, that's what we did last year to come up with the new sort of eps model.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. so the sg&a to gross like going forward should be something like 72% or 73% range. is that a good number to model in terms of...
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it, got it. okay. that's helpful.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
[speech overlap] an interesting -- interesting thing on the point that you made about advertising, our advertising is our price, right. so all of our advertising goes into an advertising in social media. it's not tv, it's not the brand advertising some of our competitors do. and that allows us to bring the price down, drive more volume and make more profit. and so, we've seen that we've got more leads that we can deal with now, over 30,000 leads every month. and so that price is the advertising and that's what drives profitability in that echopark segment so quickly.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it, got it. that's helpful. and just on this accelerated growth plan, it looks like this business, the capital outlays are not that much for the -- for the delivery centers, and seems like the business is starting to function more independent of the franchisee stores, your cash flow is improving. does this in any way accelerate a potential separation of echopark from the franchisee business? just curious as to what the latest thoughts are there. clearly, this is an attractive business. so just what the latest thoughts are there?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i'll answer that -- thank you for the question. but i think it's just -- we're going to continue to grow the business as we just put out there and we just rather not get into what else and possibilities in that area. but we're going to -- certainly we want to execute on this plan that we've put out today.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and rajat, i would add. we actually believe that we are the omnichannel and the omni-product option. we've got the full spectrum of automotive needs, all the way from new, used that are more than four year old, fixed f&i on the franchise side as well as the separated echopark is that gives us the full spectrum of the industry -- we think that's a very strong model. and on top of that, with this expansion plan, as we open up that e-commerce option and improve that and become best in class on the e-commerce side, we truly become the omnichannel choice you can do on site, you can do online or you can do somewhere in between. and so there are synergies between the two companies, and we think that's what makes us valuable.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and one of the things that we do as well, as we've talked about in the previous call, is that a lot -- there's a lot of -- there is a lot of vehicles that come to us at echopark that we then are able to share at our retail stores that have added a lot of value, a lot of profit to our -- our retail franchise stores.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
that's helpful update. and just lastly, just on july, more of a near-term question. thanks for the color on the sg&a to gross and like. just curious to have a huge spending within the month. and you know, like, just -- how are you planning for august and like what's your outlook here in the near term on your auction pricing, your sourcing pricing? so what internally have you planned in terms of like what our gpus could trend here for the rest of the year? thanks.
jeff dyke -- president, director
so, this is jeff. look, july is a lot like june. it's been a great month so far. i think we put it out there in our deck. new car volume is about the same, up 15% to 20%, somewhere in that ballpark. used vehicle volume up in the low -- low single digits. down in the low single digits on fixed operations. but the great news is that our profitability is up, and it's going to be up in july in the 140% range or so. so the sg&a is there. it's going to be in the upper 60% range in terms of -- so it's holding just like we said it would. and i would model that on into august and september. there is no reason for us to believe -- the new car inventory is getting better, so new car volume will improve as we move forward. margins are good across the board. so the third quarter should be a great quarter for us.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and -- this is health. i'll add. when you look at that slide, i believe it is 33, you look at each of the months, i think it's very telling. and obviously you can't compare june and july when you look at the operational metrics because june was a quarter ending months and those are always stronger. so july on its own is looking extremely strong. and i guess, obviously, with our sg&a reduction, 141% over last year's pre-tax, we're very pleased with.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
yeah. i think we're planning a mid-september sort of -- third week of september update for you guys. we'll continue to send out our update slides for everybody on a monthly basis so we can keep you kind of up to speed on what's going on and keep a lot of color coming at you in terms of our performance.
rajat gupta -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. great. yeah. and those have been super helpful recently. and thanks again and good luck.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
thank you so much.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
armintas sinkevicius -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the question. you provided us with the update in mid-june targeting $0.23 to $0.33 of eps and now it's already a whole lot better than the minus $0.50 from first quarter results and continue to surprise to the upside. what happened between -- i know you've talked about the acceleration but hoping to get a little bit more color on what drove that $0.23 to $0.33 up to effectively $0.64, excluding the one-time tax benefit?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. june was just an outstanding month, maybe our best profit month non-december in our company's history, and it was volume, gross, sg&a, you name it, it all happened, it all came together for us. and if you think about it in our $0.64, i think when we went into june we had $0.01 kind of on the books and we made $0.63 in the month of june alone. and so it's just a fantastic month across the board. we hit on all cylinders at echopark. it was the single best month we've had in echopark's history in terms of volume and profitability. i think we averaged 567 [phonetic] cars a store, did $550,000 in profit per location and averaged almost $1,000 of profit per unit at echopark. those are gold standard numbers.
and that's going to continue to have -- i mean, we're seeing that in july, and we expect that to continue on into -- for the rest of the third quarter. there's just nothing sort of staying in our way at this point. even with the hot spots opening up in texas and in florida with covid, we're just executing at a very, very high level and the expenses are just outstanding. we're [indecipherable] better than it's ever been. our sales associates that were selling 10 and 11 cars per sales associate are now 17, at echopark they are 25 to 30. i think our best performance is our charlotte store, 34 units per sales associate. so it just -- we are having a blast and getting better than this. and so it's going to be a great run for the rest of the quarter and into the final part of the year.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and -- this is david. i think that a big part of the two is that our -- not just our top four or five leaders -- our leadership team down into the stores and regionally are all -- they've been with us a very long time and we have very low turnover. and a lot of these guys have been through the financial crisis and all of that. so when this -- when the pandemic hit, our team jumped on it and really executed. and -- it's like necessity is the mother of invention, right. but they implemented some of these reductions and raised the bar for as jeff was saying for productivity per person, that look, you just have to do more with fewer people and executed and found out they could actually do it, and now they're believers and they're bought in. it's not just the -- again, it's not just the top four or five people, it's down into the stores that they know they can do it and they're very excited about it.
jeff dyke -- president, director
i will also add that in june all echopark stores were cash flow positive. that's a first. even our young stores like tampa, long beach were making money or cash flowing. so that's a big deal for us. we looked and we say, it's going to take six months, nine months to get them profitable and we're getting profitable in eight weeks. so the model is really paying off for us. and that's why we're going to go on this deal from an expansion perspective.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
because we keep -- we keep getting better as time goes on and how we open the stores. it's much more efficient. if we had opened the tampa store like we used to open one, two or three years ago, it wouldn't have been profitable. so the team is learning and even in the pandemic, has figured out how to open a store and get profitable really fast.
armintas sinkevicius -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then with the new -- with the new delivery and buy centers, you mentioned the one in greenville is located at a bmw-mini store. that sounds like it will start cannibalizing the volumes from your franchise used. is that the right way to think about it, that the volumes on franchised usual start to deteriorate and then really ramp up the echopark volumes?
jeff dyke -- president, director
quite the opposite.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
it's a different customer.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. and remember, we're sharing inventory so that bmw store is going to get all the trade-ins that we don't sell because we only want to sell [indecipherable] at echopark. and if you look at our denver market, our stores in denver having record -- our franchise stores in denver having record volume numbers at this point and our echopark stores having record volume numbers. and so, i think our denver market selling 1,500 cars, something like that a month, having record profit along with the franchise stores growing their used car business. so it's quite the opposite. that's why you keep these stores together. they work in harmony together. we saw a lot of cars on the franchise stores and we'll continue to do that even with the delivery and buy centers.
armintas sinkevicius -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then just the last one here. with regards to digital, you -- maybe you could get us under the hood there a little bit and share your thoughts on the cost in the darwin automotive partnership. i know digital has been something you've considered in the past. i think the thought was maybe you do something last november, that got take down the road a bit, and here we are again. so just what -- what's been the hold-up to this point and how do you envision it being differently? what do you envision that the end result looking like?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. this is heath. i'll start off. i think from our perspective, e-commerce is a spectrum. it isn't just -- e-commerce isn't just someone that's shops and buy the completely online. in fact that very rarely happens even in our competitors' world. it exists from e-commerce is shopping, it is getting the price, it is getting credit, it is getting financing, it is pretty done a down payment, it is getting a product and it's getting paperwork done. and people go in and out of that spectrum at different parts of their experience. and so you have to have an infrastructure they can handle each of those elements and if someone starts on the third step you can easily transfer to onsite or remotely with our centralized call support, right.
and so darwin is that -- that type -- you only use darwin right now to service our customers onsite. and so darwin online takes that into the online, e-commerce world so that we can easily convert someone that stops at credit and calls and wants to talk to someone at that point or comes on site, we never lose that deal, right. so that's a very, very important part of an e-commerce strategy in an automotive world. this is not like buying a pair of shoes, right. there's two parts. and so that tightening of darwin allows us to move back and forth in those settings.
we then looked at -- we did research of every single company out there and we were -- we are going to cox automotive. they have never built a proprietary system for any dealership group, and they've agreed to do that. as you know, they've got the technology resources, the automotive experience and so they are going to be building on top of darwin that best in industry user experience. so, as people go down that spectrum or funnel of e-commerce, it is going to be intuitive, it's going to be easy to use, it's going to look very similar to other e-commerce companies and it makes it a lot easier.
and so that combination -- we took our time because this isn't something that you should just throw together just so you can put a slide up there and name something whatever it is and say you're in e-commerce. we want to do it right. we want to do it, where the customer can shop the way they want to, and it's not something you throw together quickly and so we were very specific about taking our time and making that the product that it needs to be. with the combination of cox automotive and darwin, with our experience in the store, we believe this is going to be the industry leader in an omnichannel option for our customers.
armintas sinkevicius -- morgan stanley -- analyst
timing?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
timing-wise, we anticipate that we will have -- darwin is rolling out right now on the franchise side and they will be going into echopark in august. and cox automotive and darwin's product will be going out in the fourth quarter of 2020.
armintas sinkevicius -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. great. appreciate it.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and this is david. it's so important to remember how big this market is. and even the largest competitors have just a very small fraction of the market, so that our existing echopark customers are just part of the market. these people have -- they love coming and shopping at our stores. the people that are going to be served by this new -- our e-commerce, which is again the sweet side, we've very deliberately been rolling this out at the pace where we thought we could make -- it can be extremely profitable. as we mentioned the 55% return on these deals. and this will be to new customers who choose to shop in that way.
jeff dyke -- president, director
we've been very diligent with echopark and we're being very diligent with this process as well. and we've got a history of that. we want to make it right, make it industry-leading and when we get done, it will be all of that.

your next question is from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. please go ahead, sir.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
hi, bret.
ken usdin -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's just actually usdin only on for bret. thanks for taking my questions. looks like a lack of new vehicle supply is expected to sort of continue to weigh on things here in the back half of the year. when do you guys expect those levels to normalize? and then, should we see this sort of offset by higher gpus?
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey, yeah, this is jeff. that's exactly right. it's going to be a tough road for july, august, september. although we are seeing things improve, they're just not going to improve rapidly. i would look for october, november timeframe to get some normalized inventory levels. but the great news is there is low supply with high margin, and so we we're making great margin and certainly making up from a gross perspective. new models are coming out. and so -- it's all -- it all work in our favor as we move toward the end of the year.
ken usdin -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got you. great. and then with some parts of the country where covid seems to be flaring up again, are you guys seeing any demand changes with any particular regions lately?
jeff dyke -- president, director
a little bit in fixed on the west coast. that's what kind of -- we've kind of adjusted our trend there for you guys on a monthly basis, as you can see on the charts. it's just been a little bit more difficult to come back on the west coast. but other than that, like i said earlier, texas and florida, the flare-ups there have not really affected our business. it's more new vehicle inventory than it is that. and we're doing all the right things from a covid perspective for our guests and our associates, taking all the right precautions, doing all the right things. so we're not really finding that to be a detriment to the business as much as we are new vehicle inventory shortages, in particular on [indecipherable].
ken usdin -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got you. and then just sort of high level. do you guys have any internal projections on where you think retail will shake out maybe for '20 and '21?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. retail is going to be 13%, 14%, and probably again the same in '21. fleet was the most impacted right just because all the rental car companies and the big problem that you see with hertz, etc. but it's steady as she goes. in particular, it's the inventory from [indecipherable] the demand is there for the cars because inventory comes back -- it will be steady as she goes from a new car perspective.
ken usdin -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great. that's all i had. thank you very much for taking my questions.
jeff dyke -- president, director
you bet.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question is from the line of john murphy with bank of america. please go ahead.
john joseph murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. i just wanted to -- i just wanted to follow up on this cox-darwin development. and i mean you kind of talked about sort of an interface and a smarter interface and that and the like, but cox is manheim. they auction about 5 million vehicles a year and the recon a lot of them. i'm just curious as you look at this, is there an opportunity for you to source and recon vehicles directly from manheim and then turn around and retail them very quickly and increase your turns and really kind of leverage these delivery and buy centers? i mean, it just seems like you're tying up with somebody that can really help you out on the back end there.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah, i mean, they are already a great partner and we source a majority of our inventory through them as it is, right. they do a great job for us. we can do [indecipherable] we've worked with them on several projects like that. they've made some improvements to certainly discussions that we've had with them in particular those centers that are close to our stores. so that's not something that's [indecipherable] it's good thinking. but in terms of sourcing, if we're not -- we're one of their top buyers in the country. and so, they -- we have a great relationship with them. they do a great job for us and we source the majority of our inventory through them.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and it's really important to remember that this is a partnership like they've never done before.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. they've never built a proprietary instrument for anybody. and they are just -- they've just been unwilling to do that historically, but there's a lot of competition out there. i think their minds are changing on how that works. and we combine them with darwin which is sort of a piping to the swimming pool, if you will, when you combine those two things with what we've already built internally, it's going to be a great product for the consumer from a user interface perspective.
john joseph murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then also on the used car, i mean, is there any discussion or thought internally of building out a captive finco?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
no. i mean, if you look at the -- look at the progress that we've made in f&i, and i'm tipping my hat to [indecipherable] who has just done a great job with us allies, done a great job with us. i mean, our june numbers i think were a little over 2,100 all in, pur which is an all-time record for us. and that's sort of industry best. i mean, i think autonation may be a little bit higher than that. and so when you get into that level, really things will make a whole lot of sense to take the capital, go off and create [speech overlap]
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
we're not taking the risk. we're eliminating the risk.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. there's tons of risk. there's just no appetite here for that. and it doesn't do anything more for us. we've got great relationships with the banks. it's all paying off. it adds complexity. and as you know we hate complexity. it's just -- it slows us down. and we got a handful now with what we're off and running and doing than what we laid out today, so that we just add a lot of -- a lot of complexity that we're not interested in having.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and john, we've actually -- you see -- we've looked at it several times. the [indecipherable] capital is so low it let you have a high subprime population and we used to not have a high subprime population.
john joseph murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. okay. and then just lastly, i mean, what you're doing here seems to be much more focused on expanding rapidly in the used car market, which makes a lot of sense. but just curious, as you look at some of the activities that are going on in the new car franchise side, where there is an acceleration in m&a activity, what do you think about that and is there any opportunity in that direction? or is it kind of just full throttle, higher returns, higher margins on the used side and that's kind of the direction you're going to go in more as far as growing the business going forward? what's the opportunity set on the new side and why you think it's kind of different than what some other folks are going after?
jeff dyke -- president, director
i mean -- this is jeff. we love the franchise business. it's fantastic. it's a cash machine for us. if there is opportunities out there for us to buy, we'll take -- we're looking and we'll look at them every day. and we may do a deal here or there, but the returns to that [indecipherable] are so high versus the returns that we're getting, the capital you have to put into facility, you name it. it just makes a lot more sense to put your cash into echopark, but that does not mean that we won't -- you won't see us do a deal. we're looking at a couple of deals right now as a matter of fact. and we'll see what happens. but it's a lot more cost effective to invest those dollars in echopark.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
yeah -- and this is david. i think that one of the things we want our investors to understand how focused our team is on roi and allocating our capital better than we've -- we ever have in the history of the company. we're really focused on that. and so, really, it's not a emotional thing, it's just simply -- we talk about a 50% return on this new model with echopark and echopark.com, those returns are just -- it's hard, it's very difficult to find [indecipherable] beat those kind of returns in our -- in our business.
john joseph murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. great. thank you very much, guys.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director

good morning. and welcome to the sonic automotive third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. this conference call is being recorded today, thursday, october 29, 2020. presentation materials, which management will be reviewing on the conference call can be accessed at the company's website at ir.sonicautomotive.com. at this time, i would like to refer to the safe harbor statement under the private securities and litigation reform act of 1995. during this conference call, management may discuss financial projections, information or expectations about the company's products or market or otherwise make statements about the future. such statements are forward-looking and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made. these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. in addition, management may discuss certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission. please refer to the non-gaap reconciliation tables in the company's current report on form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission earlier today.
i would now like to introduce mr. jeff dyke, president of sonic automotive. mr. dyke, you may begin your conference.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to sonic automotive's third quarter 2020 earnings call. i'm jeff dyke, the company's president. joining me on the call today is our cfo, mr. heath byrd; our executive vice president of operations, mr. tim keen; and our director of financial reporting and investor relations, mr. danny wieland. this morning, we reported the highest quarterly earnings in our company's history, with adjusted eps of $1.29, up 95% from the third quarter of last year. these record results were driven by increasing consumer demand for new and used vehicles as well as improving rate of recovery on our parts and service business, continued growth in our f&i per unit and a fundamental change in our expense structure. our core franchise dealership segment performed very well during the quarter, reflecting steadily increasing consumer demand and margin improvement across all business lines. additionally, the previously announced permanent sg&a reductions continue to drive increasing operating efficiency and unprecedented bottom line profitability at the store level. turning to echopark. revenues for the quarter were $385 million or 15% of our total revenues, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis. echopark achieved all-time record quarterly retail sales volume of 15,127 units, up nearly 15% year-over-year. as we noted on our second quarter call in july, we opened our first delivery and buy center in greenville, south carolina, which continues to ramp according to our plan. in addition, we opened another retail store in houston, texas in september, and our latest retail store in nashville, tennessee just last week. before the end of the year, we expect to open two more retail stores, one in plano, texas; the other in atlanta, georgia; as well as at least one additional delivery and buy center. we remain on track with our echopark expansion plan, and we'll continue to keep you updated on our path to $14 billion in echopark revenue by 2025.
in addition to our exceptional store performance during the third quarter, we continued improving operating efficiency throughout our entire organization. adjusted sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 69.1%, down 760 basis points from the prior year. we continue to expect to achieve permanent sg&a expense reductions of approximately $7 million per month or $84 million annually on a go-forward basis. in recent months, we have seen more car buyers open to a wider range of shopping options across the omnichannel spectrum. this includes increasingly utilizing a combination of online, phone and in-person shopping to complete a vehicle purchase. several recent studies support our belief that the vast majority of consumers prefer to begin the car buying process online then visit a dealership to get access to support from knowledgeable associates and then have the ability to shop -- physically shop large inventories and, finally, test drive the vehicle before purchasing. in addition, our guests continue to tell us that price and quality are the most important factors when selecting a used vehicle. this is exactly the value proposition offered by echopark, and we firmly believe that our pricing strategy, compelled with our hybrid approach between online and on-site, offers consumers the car buying experience they want, as evidenced by yet another record quarter at echopark. as we continue to provide our guests with additional buying options, this will accelerate our echopark network expansion plans as well as enhance our guest online retail experience at our franchise dealership websites and echopark.com. given that, we are pleased to announce today that we recently hired mr. steve wittman, formerly of hertz -- the hertz organization as our new digital -- or chief digital retailing officer; and mr. stephen conrad, formerly with belt department stores, as our vice president of e-commerce, to oversee the ongoing development and future evolution of our omnichannel platform.
each of these individuals brings extensive online retail experience to our company, and we look forward to their contributions in further improving our overall guest experience. as we move forward, we believe sonic and echopark are well positioned for the future growth and success. throughout the pandemic to date, our management team has taken the necessary steps to strengthen our operations and take care of the health and safety of our teammates and guests, while also positioning the company to benefit from the economy's eventual recovery. we believe the automotive industry is at an inflection point, and we intend to capitalize on this momentum with both echopark and our sonic franchise dealerships. now i'd like to take the time to thank all of our teammates at the franchise stores and echopark stores for their relentless commitment to deliver our exceptional guest experience while executing our safety protocols. i also want to thank our manufacture and vendor partners for their unwavering support.
this concludes our opening remarks. we look forward to answering any questions you may have.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from rick nelson with stephens.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. i wanted to follow up on echopark and the profit pressures we saw in the quarter, and it looks like you took down your guide for revenues and units and profits for the year, if you can discuss those changes?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. so that's just -- it's a great question, rick, and thanks. 2020 has been a really interesting year for us, used car geeks, right? covid set aside, the inventory, in particular, from a pre-owned perspective, has just been all over the board. and what you might not know is, going into may and sort of through april, our floor plan for most of -- a lot of the franchise stores and all the echopark stores was a floating floor plan with a 30-day look back. so what were we all doing in april? we were selling down inventory and preserving liquidity because we didn't know how long the covid deal was going to last. so we got to may 1, and we had a point on may 20 where the floor plan was going to adjust and basically drop our borrowing capability by half from a floor plan perspective. so when you see -- i think if you can refer to page 46, danny, is it 46 in the deck?
danny wieland -- investor relations
correct.
jeff dyke -- president, director
you can see the great time to buy pre-owned cars was during that time, and we couldn't do it. so we really had to maintain liquidity plus a deal with the floor plan issues that we have. but heath byrd and the whole team went to work with the banks. and now we've moved from a floating floor plan to [benz-specific], and it's triple the size we have. so we have enough floor plan now for the foreseeable future. so we're in real good shape there. but by the time we got the floor plan handled, it was time we could start buying. now all of a sudden, we've gone from a historically low rate -- historically big drop in terms of wholesale pricing to now a historically high increase, some 140% of the market versus pre-covid. and so really interesting, interesting time, because we've kind of had our hands tied. had we not, then we'd obviously bought more cars during the opportunity period where the cars were a lot cheaper. having said that, if you think about it, we opened four stores during that time frame, four echopark stores. we did set all-time revenue and all-time volume records, and we remained profitable. and if that isn't just an indication of how strong the brand is and how strong the model is, i don't know what, because our hands were really tied. and so now what's great is, as the markets drop back down, i think it's about $200 above where we were, and we're off to the races again. the volumes back, the margins coming back. it did leak over a little bit into october. so we had a little margin pressure for the first few weeks of october, that's coming back. and the fun thing now is that we're basically opening an echopark store every 15 days for the foreseeable future on average. and it's just one after another. and if you look at our last two openings, like i mentioned in my opening comments, the houston southwest store, and mind you, there was another store already in houston, but the houston southwest store is going to be in the 375 to 400 car range in our first opening month.
that means that we're profitable in month number one. and then our nashville store that just opened last week, they're selling cars on a pace for over 400 car pace for an opening month. so we're real excited to see what they do in november. so yes. it's a little blip. we're still very excited about the volume that we're able to get out given the constraints that we have and look forward to having a great q4. the interesting thing is, is that when you look at it, if you run a short-day supply, which we do, and you're buying the cars all at the height, you actually had a point where the wholesale prices were more than someone running a long-day supply in their retail prices. so in other words, it was cost of being more to buy a car than some of those that had 40-, 50-, 60-day supply that they could retail the car for. and so what's going to happen now is we're going to go into the fourth quarter. and if those companies that are on long-day supplies bought a bunch of cars in august, which i suspect they did because sales were so good in july and august, then they're going to have to deal with that situation in the fourth quarter. and that's behind us now. so we're excited about where we are. we're excited about the volume we're seeing out of echopark. it's rocking and rolling again, and just a crazy time, but it's handled, and we're moving forward.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and rick, this is heath. i'll just add. if you look back at the manheim and you look at the trends, this has only happened -- it's never happened to this severity, where the wholesale and retail correlation was so far off. you had a little bit in 2008 and '09. so it really was sort of a ""black swan"" event. and it's resolved. our [benz] floor plan gives us plenty of room to grow. and as jeff mentioned, this is behind us.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great. good to hear. if you could also comment on the ability of demand that we're seeing both new and used cars, it's been really strong. i know supplies have been tight. do you think this is a multiyear demand tailwind or is it more short term?
jeff dyke -- president, director
well, let's address new first. availability is coming back. i think we've got or 1,000 or 1,200 more cars on the ground at this point than we did last month at this time. and that just keeps improving every month. manufacturer is doing a great job getting inventory back in our hands. the demand is there, and i think we'll all be back and rolling as we move into the first and second quarter of next year as supplies build. from a used car perspective, i've said this since you've known me, there's never -- we don't ever have a problem buying cars. sometimes you have to pay more for them, sometimes you pay less. we had a problem this time because we didn't have any floor plan availability. but other than that, that's all resolved. but if you go back and just look historically, and in particular, with a historically 1- to 4-year-old cars under 50,000 miles, the supply is endless. we can buy cars all day long, and that's the beauty of our model because when you mix the franchise business with echopark, and i have access to all that inventory, we just don't have a problem buying inventory. it's just -- it's never been a problem. the inventory is there. as a matter of fact, if you chart it out and you plot it out and you look at inventory supply in that supply range, it's a flat line across the board for years and years. it's just -- you just -- there's not very many blips. there's plenty of inventory out there for those that know how to go and get it.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great, and you've hired these new digital executive. is the goal to provide an online purchase at echopark? and if that's the case, what is the time line to get that up and running?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. so we have it today, right? you can go on to mercedes-benz at denver, you can go on to echopark greenville, and you can see examples of how a consumer can go end-to-end. but our definition of that is a little different than maybe what i've heard so far. our definition is, is to make it really easy. and then if a consumer wants to, which is less than 2% of the population right now, but if the consumer wants, they can go online, buy a car from end-to-end, no touchpoints, right? no touchpoints. the best-in-class right now has 10 to 15 touchpoints. and so we're building out what we have -- we're building out a solution that allows the consumer to go end-to-end, with no touchpoints, buy vehicle, do it very easily, very few clicks and deliver on that promise. so we're a little bit away from that. i mean, hopefully, we can deliver on that some time toward the end of next year. but between now and then, we certainly have a robust environment where the consumer can go in. there are going to be touchpoints just like any of our competitors, and we can deliver a car. and we have customers coming in today, and some customers are doing -- i think about 15% to 16%, 17% of our customer base right now is completing some percentage of the transaction online before they come to the store to pick it up. and i've heard those numbers and ranges from some of our competitors and reporting. so i think that's sort of the overall bucket of consumers right now that want to do that. is that going to grow in the future? who knows. but we're going to be ready for it if it does. and that's why we've added steve and stephen. they come with incredible pedigrees. their resumes are fantastic. and they snap and fit right into what we're trying to do, and we'll introduce them to you on the call next time, and they can start answering the omnichannel questions as we move forward.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
that sounds great. finally, if i could ask you about the new delivery and buy center in greenville. you mentioned that how that's performing, and the rollout plan sounds like you're going to add one more that is prior to the end of the year?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. we're probably going to add knoxville. we're working on that right now. we've got a couple of opportunities. we'll see which one fits the best. but the national store, we're trying to get it up and running, and it's up and running pretty quickly here. greenville is doing great. we sold 80 cars last month out of the store. and if you think about it, being the average new car dealer and used car stores sell 69 cars a month. we sold 80 in just our first month out of the chute here. and so we're really excited about it. we think that, that market can bring 200, 300 cars a month as we get better in our execution there. and then sort of the hub-and-spoke model will come to life. if you can picture nashville and look at memphis and knoxville and some kentucky markets, lexington, we're going to be able to deliver into those markets a lot cheaper. remember, in greenville, we're actually using an office at one of our stores there, and we delivered 80 cars there. we have no overhead, no nothing. and so it's such a great model, and we look forward to open up a bunch of those next year as we move forward. and it just puts us right on line, if not ahead, a little bit of pace, to hit our 140 stores in that $14 billion revenue number, if not better, by '25.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great, thanks a lot and goodluck guys.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you so much rich.
operator
your next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just had a question on just what you're seeing in terms of your near-term demand trends? how october looked like for you, both new/used and also parts and services? like kind of have those volumes improved from third quarter levels? and then on parts and services, how do you see the recovery shaping up here, particularly with lower miles driven, potentially likely to be lower here for the remainder of the quarter as more shutdowns come into place. just curious as to your thoughts there as you go into 2021, also. i mean, how much of a function is miles driven? like how much of that goes into the equation for the growth in that business? and how much is likely independent of miles driven and more around just company-specific actions or even like vehicle complexity, etc.?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. so thanks for the question. so let's address fixed operations first. we were actually up year-over-year by 3.6%, i think, in september, which is great. we have a day's difference in october. so i think we're going to be maybe down 1% or 2% for the month. we'll see when it all finishes up. but fixed operations is coming back slowly, but surely. and if you'll remember back when we started projecting kind of what was going to happen with volume and fixed, we said fixed a while back. it was going to take a little bit longer because of the things that you just mentioned. the other thing too is our exposure in california is quite high, and we've had more shutdowns out there than anywhere, but that market is a little bit topsy-turvy when it comes to that, a lot less driving. so that issue is certainly going on. from a used and new perspective, the business keeps just getting better. and i'll comment on both echopark and sonic automotive, in particular, at echopark in october. now that we've got that floor plan issue resolved, and our inventory levels are back up where they're supposed to be, the engine is really rolling again, and i think 5,200 to 5,500 cars for echopark out of october is a pretty decent range and certainly pushing for north of 16,000 cars in the quarter. so we're excited about that.
sort of where we should have been last quarter had we not had the slowdown there from the floor plan. the new car business is a function -- the demand is there, it's just a function of inventory. the more inventory we get, we're selling it. and the margins, which is great, because i think we all would have said, ""hey, the margins are going to get a little tighter and a little tighter, and the margins are still really good."" we're a little over 2,600 a copy, i think, for the quarter, and it's going to be strong again in the fourth quarter. and look, 2020 was a crazy year, right? but we've cut so much cost, and we've got our revenue engine going, in particular with echopark, that '21 is going to be a great year. the shutdowns, if they happen again, we're a lot more educated on how to deal with them. we've got a whole different cost structure. we're just -- the economy's better prepared to deal with it. and so if it happens, it happens. we'll -- as we've always done, we'll stay strong as we move through this. but we think '21 is going to be a fantastic year. 2020 is by far and away going to be a record-breaking year for us from an eps perspective. and we expect to do that again even better in '21, with great volume growth and a fantastic growth out of echopark.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, that's helpful. on echopark ebitda, i mean, you explained about the issues that happened in the third quarter. should the fourth quarter ebitda -- is that expected to get back to the prior run rate of like, say, $5 million, $6 million in ebitda? or should we consider any offsets even to that with the new stores opening up? and just looking into 2021, not -- i'm pretty sure you cannot guide, but is that exit rate of echopark like a good starting point to assume when you look at -- look into 2021 ebitda potential for echopark? just any color on the puts and takes there would be helpful.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. so here's how i look at -- here's how i kind of guide you there. you know, we had still a little bleed over from inventories from september into october. so the first few weeks of october, still difficult margins, but that's finishing now. it's not done right now. and so november and december should be back on our normal ebitda pace. however, you need to remember that we're accelerating our openings, right? so the model that we got used to in 2019 and throughout 2020, where you got that $5 million in ebitda, we're accelerating our openings. and what that means is i'm carrying people, i'm carrying managers on my employee list now, then i'm going to deploy in the next six to eight to nine months. so we've got a little bit of a carrying cost as we expand the revenue. and that's just natural. that's just a common sense that, that's going to happen. so i would expect a better q4 from an ebitda perspective than what we saw in q3. and then i would expect -- because the ramp-ups are so much faster or the last couple have been really fast in houston and in nashville, in terms of getting to profitability, i don't expect to lag these three and four or five months lags to get profitable as we move forward. and of course, the delivery centers are profitable most immediately as well. so i mean i'm not afraid of that $5 million, $6 million ebitda quarter, and still -- and growing like we're going to grow. but keep in mind that the growth is going to include having us hire people ahead of time and ramp up to get ready for these store openings.

and jeff, this is danny. just to add to that. in the third quarter, we had $1.8 million of ebitda drag from those new openings as well. and we had about $5 million of gross because of the margin pressure that we talked about at echopark, that we lost in that quarter. so that $3.1 million of actual ebitda you see is reflective of both of those. so as we go forward, you're still going to have to drag from new openings, but if those margin normalize here coming out of october, that should give us some upside.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. and the new openings, you know, the delivery and buy centers are real inexpensive to open. let's take -- it's either -- we either own the property or it's a lease, and we're talking about maybe $2 million to get a store opening, $3 million at the most versus a traditional echopark store that's anywhere from 10 to 20 depending on the size of the store.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. just last one for me. on the sg&a side, i mean, because you did not have like a similar kind of like gross margin tailwind as some of your competitors, is this kind of like the -- i mean, start on the new side probably, but how should we think about the sg&a-to-gross progression there? i mean you've talked about 72% to 73% in the past on a normalized basis. like has that thinking changed at all? or are we still on track to hit that kind of number here on an organized basis?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, this is heath. if you look at the fourth quarter, it's going to be very similar to q3 from a percentage of -- sg&a percentage gross. and then as you go into 2021, i think if you look at the total year this year, it's going to be around 73% for the whole full year. probably 69% in the fourth quarter is what we're projecting. and as you go into 2021, you've got to factor in that first quarter where we did not have those annual savings that we got after covid. and if you think of that, you're going to be looking at low-70s as a percent of gross for 2021.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. that's super helpful color. thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from john murphy with bank of america.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning guys. a first quick question on echopark. i mean, opening one store every 15 days is pretty impressive. it's kind of -- you're sticking your plan and it seems like accelerating a little bit. but when you think about human capital that needs to go into that store, i mean, that's kind of a challenge at that pace. i know you're saying you're carrying a backlog of folks, but i'm just curious how you're sourcing them? i'm not sure you're calling people gms in that store, but your equivalent gm in that store, where are they coming from? where is that backlog being built? and how do you get comfortable with that human capital that needs to go in, which is obviously very important in any store?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes, john, good question. so part of that $1.8 billion is that drag of human capital, right, that heath mentioned earlier or danny mentioned earlier. and then what you have to remember is the delivery and buy centers, the head count in those is about 10 people. so it's not real, real top-heavy when it comes to head count, right? it's very few people. so we're growing those internally. and we haven't had a problem yet. i mean, we're opening -- obviously, we've opened a lot of stores here recently and we're opening a lot more before the year is over. and we're ready. we already have those managers picked out. and we've got the managers picked out for the next 10 stores that are all working in our environment today. but it's part of the drag that you'll see on the ebitda carrying that head count well ahead of time to make sure that, when they go into a store, they can provide that culture. you look at our reputation.com scores at echopark, and they're off the charts. and we've got to have the culture and what we train our people to do. we've got to be able to move that from store to store to store. so we've been very, very thoughtful about the pace of opening and making sure that we carry that culture from store to store to store. but i think it's really important to remember there's a part of that opening store every 15 days or so here that their delivery and buy centers are a lot easier to open and a lot less intensive when it comes to personnel.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
and i'm sorry, so all of those folks are coming from internal sonic stores at the moment. is that a correct statement?
jeff dyke -- president, director
that is correct.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. then second, i mean, there's a great debate going on right now on what kind of footprint you need, either both in used or new whether a robust local geography coverage is good enough where you need to be in a national footprint that you're reaching everybody. i'm just curious what your thought is there on your core dealer franchises as well as for echopark?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. i mean, on the new car franchise, the franchise laws and the rules between the manufacturers are going to keep you from really selling cars all over everywhere -- and advertising cars all over everywhere. that's a battle that i've seen coming. i've mentioned in previous quarters before. it's going to be really interesting as e-commerce grows, and our reach grows, quite honestly, makes the idea of having fewer dealers even greater, right? then from a new car perspective -- or from a used car perspective, in particular, echopark, it's just the distribution network. we need a distribution network that covers the entire united states. we believe that every mid, major market in the country deserves this brand and deserves the experience that this brand provides, and we're going to do that. and that's what our plan is by the time we get to 2025, is to be serving a majority of this country with the brand. so i don't think you can just do that with 10 sort of recon centers all over the country. if you read the data and you look at what the consumers are saying, the consumers are telling us that they want to be able to search our inventory online, but they want to come to a store, sit with an associate that's got experience dealing with the car that they're looking at. they want to test drive from a big inventory before they buy a car and make that decision. our goal in our hybrid approach from a to z is to allow them, if they want to go a to j or they want to go a to z, our system is going to allow that to happen. and so they can do it now in our stores and buy echopark by the end of the quarter. but it's wonky, right? there's still touchpoints all over everywhere, just like there is in any auto retailer i might add in the country today. nobody, not one auto retailer delivers a car a to z with no touchpoints. that's what we're trying to build as an option. now it's a very small percentage of the buying base, but it's still incredibly important to provide that experience and to provide that hybrid approach with a distribution network that allows us to touch every mid and major market in the country.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
just a follow-up to what you just said, when you think about getting deals done, right, a lot of people, as they're thinking about things being done truly online, i think the f&i process is sort of the last hurdle where you -- the last thing you want to do is say no to somebody and then just lose them. but when you're interacting with them either on the phone or in person, you have the opportunity to maybe shift them if they can't get financed for the vehicle they want, you can kind of work them into another vehicle that may be good for them that they get financed for. is that really just a major hurdle to getting this done completely a to z online? and how often does the financing discussion include, hey, maybe go down a trim level or, hey, maybe you'll consider this other vehicle, and you do that in a plight way not to alienate the consumer that would be very difficult to do in a to z online?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes, that's another good question. it's far too complex to do a to z purely with no touchpoints. and that's why it's going to always stay a very small percentage of the consumer base for the foreseeable future. you do end up getting on the phone. in our greenville store, for example, our f&i department and our sales department is here in charlotte, and we're delivering cars into greenville and doing a good job with it. and our f&i numbers haven't changed, right? there's still -- that's one thing i think we've all learned is, the more the business becomes online, we can still sell f&i products. and as you know, that's a real big part of echopark's profitability statement. it's all of it. and so that was a big question mark in our head, and we've overcome that. we're not worried about that as being a stumbling block for us any longer. but it's going to be -- it's very difficult for me to believe that you're going to complete automotive transactions with the appraisal, with the financing that you have to go through with something that gets turned down and you need to flip them like you were talking about and not have a touchpoint and do all that electronically a to z. but i do believe that you need to be able to offer an experience, whether it's a to z or a to q. the experience needs to be easy like amazon, right? it needs to have very few clicks to get the consumer to a point, and then when they arrive at the store to take off from that point and have the exact same or better experience online as you have at the store level. and those are the things. that's why we're making the investments in steve and steven and why we brought them in. because we feel like, long term, we need that expertise that you would find at an amazon or you find at a google or wherever that can help us look at it just a little bit differently versus looking at it through the lenses of an auto retailer. in all our retailers, i don't care if you're the best-in-class or not, we're all experiencing the same thing. and we're going to work very hard to make it a lot more simple for the consumer to have a great experience online.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and john, this is heath. i'll just add. we've talked about these expense reductions and the majority of that has been through productivity, and we all truly believe, regardless of the percent that wants to go from a to z, the more you can get from a to j or further down the line, it makes us that much more productive. and so not -- forget about the consumer experience, which we absolutely want to provide. from a productivity standpoint, the more you can do online, the better it is for us. and so it's a very integral part in the sg&a as well. and i do believe, i completely agree with jeff, it's a very complex algorithm to solve. but there are technologies coming out with ai, etc., where you can start getting them further down the line, even when there's questions about financing. so it's going to be an evolution, and we're committed to it.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. and then just -- that's very helpful. and then just lastly, on the used vehicle sort of heartburn you had in the quarter with being a little bit short of the floor plan financing. now that, that's worked out, it's very likely that used vehicle pricing will be somewhat volatile going forward. i mean there's just some factors that are sort of likely to drive that. i'm just curious, if you think about -- now that you got through that heartburn on the floor plan side, has anything changed in a way that you would manage your used vehicle inventory? or is it still, hey, i'm going to stay in 30- to 45-day window, not get beyond that, keep it tight, and that's the best way to do it? because you're kind of saying that some folks who had 50-, 60-day inventory were doing better because they had cheaper inventory to sell out of. i'm just curious if anything has changed there or you should think about it in the same way?
jeff dyke -- president, director
no. i mean, look, at the end of the day, if we had the floor plan and the prices dropped like that to historically low levels, we knew it wouldn't stay that way. we'd bought the hell out of it and a much higher day supply. that wouldn't have been a problem. and most of our competition did. look at all their day supply numbers that they've announced. they're much higher than where we are. we had a point when we got to the end of april, that we had 15 -- that we had some regions within sonic and echopark sitting in a 15-day on-lot inventory. i mean our dallas store, as you saw in our charts, that store got down to 500 cars, and we're just managing that floor plan as best we could, and we just had to fight with one hand tied behind our back. but to be able to do that and still come out with an all-time record was just amazing. and again -- and did stay profitable during all that because the margins really took a hit when you had to buy all that inventory when the market was 120%, 130%, 140% above. so yes, we would buy inventory during a downturn like that, and we'd adjust our base supply accordingly and have more inventory on the ground, no problem. we just couldn't.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and this is heath...
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, but...
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
i'll add that. if this was a one-time black swan event, so yes, we'd have the foresight in the floor plan. we would have changed our model at that point. but 99.9% of the time for the last four years, that short-day supply is the best way to run your inventory and be profitable.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. yeah, makes sense.okay, thanks so much guys
jeff dyke -- president, director
you bet john.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is mark jordan on for bret.
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey mark.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
most of my questions have been asked here, so i guess, let's do two quick ones. so thinking about new inventories, i guess, where did you end the quarter for days supply? and where should we think about inventories getting back to more normalized levels? is that kind of early next year? and i guess i'll piggyback on that with new gpus where we're pretty stronger in the quarter. do we expect those moderate sequentially? or do they kind of stay elevated again in q4?
jeff dyke -- president, director
our new car day supply was 43 days to end the quarter. that's going to continue to get better as we move forward. but we're going to do our best not to bring inventories back as high as they were. and i think everybody is going to be doing that, including most of the manufacturers. the margins are going to be good this quarter for new. i mean they may not be quite as robust as they were in the third quarter, but they're still tracking to be really nice. and i expect that to last through the first quarter, too. and if the manufacturers behave appropriately, and they don't oversupply, we can all have higher margins and they can have higher margins. we can all make more money. the problem is when they get into oversupplying cars and all of a sudden, here come all the gains with the incentives and all the bologne, it makes it a lot more difficult. so i think we've got a good couple of quarters ahead of us with much better margins, better inventory management, and hopefully, the world learns from that, and we continue forward like that.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. then just one more, thinking about f&i per unit on the franchise side. i guess, it was up nicely year-over-year, down a bit sequentially. but thinking longer term, how should we think about the opportunity there to continue expanding the f&i per unit?
jeff dyke -- president, director
i mean, it's -- look, we've got some of our competitors up over $2,000 a copy, and that's where we're headed as well. i think there's tons of upside. we continue to improve every month. we get it a little better and a little better as an organization. and october is no different. it's getting a little better, and we expect that to continue. so i think there's a lot of upside. and when you place that upside, a couple of hundred dollars a car on the kind of volume that we do, that's a big number.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.

good morning, and welcome to the sonic automotive fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. this conference call is being recorded today, wednesday, february 17, 2021. presentation materials, which accompany management's discussion on the conference call, can be accessed at the company's website at ir.sonicautomotive.com.
at this time, i would like to refer to the safe harbor statement under the private securities and litigation reform act of 1995. during this conference call, management may discuss financial projections, information or expectations about the company's products or market or otherwise make statements about the future. such statements are forward-looking and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the statements made. those risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission.

i would now like to introduce mr. jeff dyke, president of sonic automotive. mr. dyke, you may begin your conference.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you. and special note, everybody, i was caught in texas in this unprecedented snow and ice storm and temperature storm. we're low on electricity. so if for some reason i cut out, heath byrd will take over my speaking notes.
with that, good morning, everyone, and welcome to sonic automotive's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call.
i'm jeff dyke, the company's president. joining me on the call today is our cfo, mr. heath byrd; our executive vice president of operations, mr. tim keen; our vice president of investor relations, mr. danny wieland; and our chief digital retail officer, mr. steve wittman, who recently joined our team to drive the expansion of our omnichannel digital retail platform.
earlier today, we reported the highest quarterly revenues and earnings in our company's history, with record fourth quarter revenues of $2.8 billion and an adjusted eps of $1.50, up 54.6% from the fourth quarter of 2019. in addition, the full year 2020 was our second consecutive year of all-time record adjusted earnings, with adjusted eps of $3.85, up 45.3% from $2.65 in 2019. these record results reflect the strength of our diversified business model, the dedication of our teammates and the support of our manufacture and vendor partners in the face of unprecedented challenges as we faced together this year.
during 2020, we took targeted measures to improve operating efficiencies and manage expense throughout our entire organization, fundamentally improving our cost structure. as a result, we achieved all-time record adjusted sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit of 68.1% for the fourth quarter of 2020, down 560 basis points from 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. full year 2020 adjusted sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 72.9%, 400 basis points better than 2019. for 2021, we expect to continue to see a benefit of our permanent sg&a reductions. however, the rapid rate of expansion at echopark may drive an increase in sg&a as a percentage of gross profit, while still being accretive to the bottom line overall.
turning to our core franchise dealership segment. fourth quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, down 1.2% from the prior year and up 11.5% sequentially from the third quarter of 2020. franchise dealership segment income increased $37.1 million or 68.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by strong new vehicle and f&i gross profit per unit and a $30.3 million reduction in adjusted sg&a expenses. franchise dealership segment adjusted sg&a as a percentage of gross profit was 65.2%, down 810 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019.
looking at echopark. for the fourth quarter, revenues were an all-time record of $386.9 million, up 25.4% from the prior year quarter. this growth was driven by a 17.1% increase in used vehicle unit sales volume to 14,841 units. for the full year 2020, echopark revenues were $1.4 billion, a 22.1% increase compared to 2019, with retail sales volume of 57,161 units, up 15.4% from 2019. for the first quarter of 2021, we expect to retail between 18,000 and 19,000 units at echopark on our way to delivering between 100,000 and 105,000 units for the full year of 2021.
as part of our echopark expansion strategy, we recently completed the acquisition of two pre-owned businesses in maryland and new york, expanding our geographic footprint into the mid-atlantic and northeast. these include carbiz serving the greater baltimore washington metro area and used car king, a syracuse-based pre-owned group serving car buyers throughout new york state. each of these businesses already embraces the same culture and values that define echopark, with a highly qualified team focused on providing an exceptional experience and incredible value to their guests. we're in the process of transitioning these acquisitions into our echopark model and expect them to generate total annual revenues in excess of $350 million at maturity before any revenues from future delivery and buy centers that these markets will support.
by way of update, our delivery and buy center concept, our first market in greenville, south carolina, retailed 166 units and was profitable in january in its six full months of operation. our second delivery and buy center in knoxville, tennessee, opened in late december and retailed 55 units in its first full month, nearly mirroring what we saw in greenville in month one. for comparison, before entering these markets with the delivery and buy center model, we sold an average of 10 to 12 units per month in greenville and two to three units per month in knoxville from our nearest hubs, demonstrating that these truly are incremental sales into the adjacent markets.
the opening of four new echopark locations in the fourth quarter and seven for the full year of 2020 brings our total at year-end to 16. these, plus the two acquisitions completed to date, the opening of our phoenix, arizona store next week and the additional openings in 2021 will give us over 40 points in place by the end of 2021. as you can see, we are well under way in establishing our 140-plus point echopark nationwide distribution network, which is expected to retail over 0.5 million pre-owned vehicles annually and drive $14 billion in annual revenue -- annual echopark revenues by 2025.
in the meantime, we're focused on addressing the tremendous growth opportunity and untapped value in echopark's unique pre-owned vehicle sales concept. car buyers nationwide continue to discover the exceptional pricing, inventory selection, purchase experience that echopark offers. the guest-centric in-store experience, combined with our omnichannel tools and delivery center model, offers echopark shoppers a full range of buying options to meet their needs. our consumer studies, including a harris insights poll commissioned in september of 2020 continued to reaffirm our belief in an omnichannel approach matches the ideal purchase experience for the vast majority of car buyers. when we launch our new digital retail platform in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to provide our guests with an online experience that sets a new standard of excellence in this industry.
before we turn the call over for your questions, i'd like to talk about the market conditions and trends we're seeing throughout the first month and a half of 2021. the new vehicle sales momentum and elevated margins from the fourth quarter had carried into 2021, and the industry slowdown in used vehicle demand in november and december has steadily improved in january and february to date. while the pressure on used vehicle margins at echopark persisted longer than we expected in the fourth quarter, january total gross per unit was back in line with our model and our expectations for 2021. our franchise dealerships, parts and service business continues to recover more slowly than we'd like, but is showing signs of improvement.
adjusted for calendar differences year-over-year, our fixed operations gross was down roughly 4% in january compared to nearly 6% for the fourth quarter. we believe as the vaccine rollout continues to gain momentum and americans feel more comfortable resuming daily activities as the year progresses, our parts and service business will bounce back. f&i continues to be a highlight of our business as we eclipsed $2,000 per unit for the first time in the fourth quarter and continue to expect growth in this area in 2021.
in closing, 2020 was a challenging year in many ways. however, our fourth quarter and full year results show the strength and resiliency of our franchise and echopark models. we are much leaner, we're more efficient and we're a stronger company than we were prior to 2020, and we believe each of our business segments is well-positioned for both near-term and long-term success. the stage is set for an exciting 2021 for sonic automotive, with 25 new echopark locations to open and roll out -- and the rollout of our new omnichannel digital retail platform by the end of the year. as always, we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year.
and this concludes my opening remarks. and now i'm going to turn the call over to heath byrd for a few opening remarks of his. thank you.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, jeff.
before we open up for questions, i just wanted to provide a little bit more color on what we're seeing in our 2021 outlook. as jeff mentioned, these numbers and this outlook is in line with what we're seeing in january and february. also keep in mind, as jeff mentioned -- he's in the middle of a storm -- some of these numbers, the first quarter, we're going to have some impact from the storms. this impacts texas, which you guys know is one of our largest franchise markets. it is our largest echopark market. it's also going to affect birmingham, nashville. and so hopefully, it [indecipherable] up quickly, but obviously, there'll be some impact. those stores right now are closed. it's also important to note that the outlook i'm going to go over real quickly, the majority of the growth is weighted to the second half of the year. obviously, we believe that things will pick up dramatically as vaccines are rolling out and we get back to normal.
so on the franchise side, on new, we expect the growth rate to be up double digits on volume. gpu, we think it will continue to be elevated. we're also aware of the shortage of inventory through the first half and start to normalize in the second half of the year. franchise used, we are expecting and looking to a low double-digit growth in volume. the gpus, as jeff mentioned, are normalizing, and we expect those to normalize at approximately $1,300 for the full year.
fixed, we are forecasting full year to be up single -- high single digits. this is definitely weighted to the second half of the year. we still have, as you all know, large portfolio is related in california, and we still see some closing there. so we think that will ramp up more in the second half of the year. f&i gross, low double-digit growth. we continue to see opportunity to increase our gpu and continue to surpass the $2,000 per unit.
on the echopark segment, as jeff mentioned, we had 16 stores at the end of the year. we actually opened up four in the fourth quarter. that will grow to 40 locations by the end of 2021. that's 2.5 times our current footprint, so very busy with new stores. units, we expect growth of 75% to 85% in units year-over-year. as a percent of the total revenue, echopark was about 15% of total revenue in 2020. we expect that to grow to 20% to 25% in 2021 as it continues to be a higher percentage of the business here at sonic.
echopark ebitda was approximately $11 million in 2020. that includes the drag of $6.6 million from the new stores. we expect that to be approximately double that in 2021, and that includes a drag of about $12 million to $14 million of ebitda related to the new stores that are opening in 2021. and that ebitda growth is definitely weighted to the second half of the year as we open up new stores and they start maturing.
from a capex perspective, on echopark, we have budgeted $75 million in capex for that growth. you can see treating all those or developing all those locations at such a low capex spend. this is a capital-light strategy, and this allows us to take that free cash flow that is being generated on the franchise side and increase our liquidity and also increase our opportunities for growth on the franchise side. so you can see very low capex to get to that 40 new stores at echopark.
so from a consolidated standpoint, a couple of things to keep in mind. i think it's very important we talk about this each year. the profit cadence at sonic because our portfolio mix, about 15% to 20% of our profitability will come in the first quarter, 25% in the second, 25% in the third, and 30% to 35% in the fourth quarter. again, that's that luxury brand mix that has such a big fourth quarter.
sg&a perspective, on a consolidated basis, 2020 was 72.9%. we expect that to be flat to slightly up in 2021. the franchise sg&a will continue to lever. we've mentioned the $84 million that we continue to see in reduced expenses, but that will be offset -- that lowering of sg&a on the franchise side will be offset due to the new stores that we're opening at echopark.
another thing to keep in mind, if you're looking at q1, typically because of seasonality cadence, our sg&a as a percent of gross is typically 700 basis points to 900 basis points worse from -- when you relate it to q4.
ebitda, we expect that to be low double-digit growth in ebitda. tax rate and shares, we are modeling an expected tax rate of approximately 26% to 28%. share count, we'll maintain approximately 44 million. we will do share repurchase to ensure there's no dilution from the investments that will happen in 2021.
and with that, i will turn the call over for questions.

[operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of rick nelson from stephens. your line is open.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning. and thanks for outlook -- color around 2021. i want to dig in a bit to echopark. i guess on the franchise side, the used business was a little tough from a gpu standpoint. if you could talk about what you think happened in november, december, and things seem to be back on track here in january outside of the weather issues.
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey, rick, this is jeff dyke. so on the franchise side of the business, a couple of things happened. one, as you know, we've got a lot of stores in our portfolio on the west coast, and we've got a lot of bmw stores there. and with the unprecedented amount of lease returns that are coming back, that -- and the margin that we're losing on those lease returns because bmw and a lot of the high line dealers held lease returns for a while going through covid. we're getting all those returns back. and our margins are a lot less on those cars today than they were four, five months ago. so that's playing a big role. we don't expect that to continue. bmw is working with us and so are the other manufacturers. so we don't expect that to continue, but certainly played a role in our margin on the franchise side throughout the fourth quarter and a little bit in january, but it's certainly normalizing.
on the echopark side, you really have to break the segment down -- the used car segment down into the one to four-year-old category and then older. anything five years and older, we're all making great margin on, and that exists on the franchise side of the business and -- but not at echopark because at echopark, we're one to four years only. and the margin on the one to four-year-old and our 30-day supply inventory targets that we keep and turning that inventory really fast, which helps us get to the high volumes that we need for our model, created an overhang in terms of margin erosion longer in the fourth quarter than we thought it would.
the good news is that inventories are back in line, margins are relative again to where we were pre-covid, and so we're off to the races again. and you couple that with a great first quarter, 18,000 to 19,000 cars and our focus on selling 100,000 to 105,000 cars for the year, and echopark is just going to have smashingly good year. so unprecedented times, when you have these massive swings in inventory valuations. it definitely affected what was a shrinking one to four-year-old category in terms of volume in the fourth quarter across the country. it certainly affected the margin. but we're back on track and expect no issues as we move forward.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. great. thanks for that. so looking at 2021, i guess, from a different perspective, if we go back to pre-covid earnings power 2019, add in the benefits of that $84 million in cost takeout, we've got benefits from lower floor plan; interest expense lower rates there. i'm calculating a number around $4.71. and then f&i should be higher in 2021 compared to 2019. we've got growth in echopark in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019. you had excess free cash flow, it looks like that would support buybacks or acquisitions. i'd like to get your comments there. anything i'm missing? i guess, the gpu, probably not sustainable, but should be bigger in 2021 compared to 2019?
jeff dyke -- president, director
so, this is jeff. a lot to unravel there. when you -- i expect the new car gpus in the first half of 2021 to be great, just like they have been. i expect all that to carry over. i expect f&i. we eclipsed a $2,000 mark. i expect f&i to continue to do very, very well. i think from an eps perspective and ebitda perspective, the only thing, rick, that you should really need to think about a little bit there is the drag that we'll get. we're going to open 25 stores. there's a lot of complexity moving from -- we grew echopark, we stopped growing it, we made it profitable, we proved our model. and now we're going back into growth mode. and there's a lot of complexity in growing that many stores that fast, but we're very confident that we can get that done. but it is going to -- as heath stated in his opening statements, it is going to create -- it's going to create drag from the sg&a perspective.
so i think you need to make sure that as you're modeling '21, you sort of -- you make sure that you include those thoughts in your model because there is, i would say, somewhere between $12 million and $15 million drag from opening those up on an sg&a -- from an sg&a perspective.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, and, rick, this is heath. i'll just add. i think you're spot on. i think that if you look at the total business model and all the metrics that drive profitability, you've got tailwinds in almost every category. we do think that fixed will pick up in the second half of the year. new, as jeff mentioned, gpus are going to still be elevated in this half. we usually have a lot of opportunity based on what we discussed in the opening comments on both the echopark and franchise side. and so really, the drag is the opening of echopark. but all the other segments, we expect to have tailwinds and to have a very good year in every one of those segments, with the drag being the expansion, the accelerated expansion of echopark and the expenses related to that.
jeff dyke -- president, director
it should be another record-setting year for all intents and purposes. as heath discussed, the tailwind should really drive us to another record-setting year.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then finally, on the balance sheet. i think debt to -- net debt-to-ebitda below 2 times, actually closer to 1 times, you should be able to fully fund capex with free cash on the franchise side of the house. what is your thoughts, i guess, about capital allocation, your targeted leverage ratio and what you do with the excess cash?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, a couple of things. you're exactly right. the fact that we have -- with echopark, it is a capital-light kind of strategy. we can actually grow that without continuing. we're at the point now that we don't have to utilize all the free cash flow from the franchise side of the business. so number one, we believe that we can start accumulating additional liquidity, which can be used for opportunities on the franchise side, number one. and number two, nothing has been contemplated, but we absolutely have capacity. if we see a good opportunity, we obviously have capacity from a debt perspective.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and would you contemplate accelerating echopark growth or would the infrastructure not support -- support that?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, obviously, from a capex perspective, we've got plenty of cash to do it. it's a resource perspective. we're actually putting up a store every two weeks, actually every week almost. and so it's a resource perspective more than it is capital.
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey, rick, this is jeff. so the other thing is that -- and it's one thing that you saw us do in the fourth quarter, is we acquired two dealer -- two groups from a pre-owned perspective that fit our model. and so that's another piece of the evolution that's happening at echopark that will allow us to grow faster because you have already personnel in place, you have facilities in place, no really capital constraints to build. and so all we have to do is train, build the inventory pipeline and price, and away we go. and so it makes us be able to expand quicker. so as those deals -- as those opportunities come along, you'll see us take advantage of that because it will allow us to move even faster toward that $14 billion number that we've been talking about for 2025.
danny wieland -- vice president, investor relations & financial reporting
and to add to that -- this is danny. i think the one thing that -- on the pre-owned side relative to franchise acquisitions, we can accomplish those in a much shorter time frame in as little as 30 days, much lower ebit multiple. you don't have manufacturer considerations in terms of approvals and things that can slow and drag out that process. so it allows us to, as you said, accelerate that growth, do so much more cost effectively and solve even capital resource constraints.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's a very good point. then what you have to do in the expense to entry into like an acquisition of the pre-owned is dramatically less than on the new side.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc. -- analyst
excellent. thanks for the color. and good luck.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you, rick.
operator
your next question comes from the line of rajat gupta from jpmorgan. your line is open.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
all right. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i appreciate all the color on the 2021 moving parts. just one point of clarification and then a couple of questions. sort of for the first quarter, the comment around 15% to 20% of earnings, was that like -- was that an eps number or was that ebitda or pre-tax? i just wanted to clarify that seasonality that you have provided for this year.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, that is a profit. it's related to profit, 15% to 20% of our total profit for the year we realize in q1.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
[speech overlap] the net income, is that it or?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. from a net income or eps perspective, 2020 was an outlier if you look back at the years prior to that. that's typically our seasonal cadence for the quarterly contributions.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
okay. i understand. and just taking into account the strength you're seeing on the new vehicle gross as well, is that right? or is that just more of a normalized trajectory excluding the benefits of...
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, it's purely a percentage of the total year. it definitely takes into account what we're seeing in january and february, but we expect to see that throughout the year. so as a percentage, we still think it's 15% to 20% we'll see in the first quarter. and if you look at what new grosses [technical issues] from q3 to q4, that's where you see our luxury rating come in even relative to the rest of the industry, and we get the downside of that coming out of q4 into q1.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and then just on the echopark side of things, you guided to roughly $20 million to $22 million in ebitda for this -- i mean, this is still like, you're still 90% away from your five-year target here. so when is the -- when is the period or the quarter or the year really where you can see earnings there inflecting? i mean, you have obviously ramping up these new stores and the added costs coming with that. but i mean, you're essentially guiding to 2021 ebitda flat with 2019 levels for echopark. so despite several -- despite twice the number of units, and you're going to continue to add a lot more stores going forward. so is 2022 the real year of inflection? or is it 2023? just curious if you could just give us some sense of that trajectory toward your five-year plan on ebitda. and i have one last follow-up.
jeff dyke -- president, director
so rajat, this is jeff dyke [technical issues] jeff dyke. one of the -- one of the things that you need to think about is, in 2019, we really slowed opening stores, right, to prove the profitability and concept of echopark, right, that we could actually sell a bunch of cars and make money, which is a novel idea in the same time. and so, now that we're moving into -- we've never opened 25 stores in 1 year. in '20, we opened seven, and so there's a lot of drag that comes along with that. we could, tomorrow, stop opening stores and return to really high profitability. but you're going to see us grow another 25 stores in '22, another 25 stores in '23, on our way to having this 140-plus distribution network across the country. we -- you'll continue to see profitability improve as we move into '22 and '23, where you have more stores that are maturing. it's taking six, eight, nine months to get the stores really off the ground and profitable.
the great news about -- of our recent announcement today is the delivery center was profitable in six months. we sold that 166 units and made money in the first six months. so that's really, really good news for us. and our second delivery center is taking off the same way as our first. so i would expect profitability to be what we're calling out this year, and i would expect to see that continue to improve as the stores continue to mature.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and if you look at -- based on our projections, 2022 is when you start seeing -- you've now got 40 locations, 45 locations that have gone through their maturity or a portion of their maturity. so, to answer your question specifically, 2022 is when we see that tipping point that you've started having enough stores that have matured that more is hitting that bottom line profit.
danny wieland -- vice president, investor relations & financial reporting
and just to add to that. for each of the 25 store cohort that we open, that's $12 million to $14 million of ebitda drag from a preopening and pre-breakeven loss perspective. and so that's steady from 2021 through 2025. from the initial base stores, the 16 we got today going into '22, it will be 40-plus stores. those will continue to mature. so if you're comparing our outlook for 2021 back to 2019 levels, it's really the $20 million we did in 2019 is comparable to the $33 million to $35 million that we forecast for 2021, excluding that drag from new stores, if that helps.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
exactly.
jeff dyke -- president, director
correct.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful color. and just last one on the digital rollout. could you give us a sense of how many cars were sold through those channels where it was a contactless transaction, either the customer getting it home delivered or just picking up the car? and also, if you could give us an update on the rollout of the darwin-cox platform, how that's going? any updates on that? or when you expect that to be fully live with all the inventory, that will be helpful. that's it for me. thanks.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
sure. rajat, this is steve wittman, chief digital retail officer here at sonic. two questions there. so the first one, on the percentage of cars that have gone through additional channels. so we actually think about it a little bit differently. we think about it from a consumer perspective because we want to make sure we serve the consumer throughout their customer journey. and this journey is a mix of physical and digital interactions with us, both on our website and our call centers and, of course, in our physical locations. and we've tried to really be consumer-centric here, right? so we've done -- like jeff mentioned, we've done some good research with the harris poll in september of 2020, which told us that only really 9% of consumers want to execute their digital -- their process 100% digitally. about 75% of consumers conversely want to have a hybrid model. so we actually think about omnichannel as a hybrid model where the consumer can dip in and out of both physical and digital and have a seamless handoff between the two so that we can be adaptable to their needs. so that's our strategy. our strategy is to have an omnichannel infrastructure in place. our strategy is also to make sure that handoff is seamless so the consumer doesn't notice anything when they talk to a person versus when they interact online.
now, specific data for sonic in the last year. about 90% of our consumers actually start on our website before they come and they come into our stores. about 40% of our consumers take action online. what i mean by take action online, that means that they fill out the contract form, fill out the financing form, talk to some person [indecipherable] chat, that kind of thing. and the last thing, we do see about 10% of consumers go end-to-end online with the darwin tool. and that's -- on average, saves our consumer about two hours at the dealership. that time saving is a key piece in delighting our consumers, and they both dip in and out of physical and digital. so that's the first answer for the first question.
the second question is how we're thinking about our digital strategy this year. and really it's a parallel path. so the two paths are: one, we're optimizing what we have with the darwin and cox relationship, and you've seen some of those changes already happen online. you can go to our echopark website and look at our vehicle listing page, and you can see that we've dramatically simplified it. we've made consumer interaction with our photos better. we've given consumers more options and seeing more cars above [indecipherable]. so we tried to improve what the consumer is seeing right now on our websites. same thing with darwin. we made the process clear, where the consumer is in the process, we've simplified the language to really turn it into consumer language, not dealer language.
in parallel, we've kicked off a massive project here at sonic to create the best e-commerce platform in the automotive industry. and what we're doing there is we're partnering with an outside firm and we're looking at what is the best e-commerce experiences that consumers have in automotive, but also outside automotive. so consumers have great experiences on amazon, on wayfair, on walmart.com, and we want to apply those learnings to the car buying industry and give consumers something really, really special that really leapfrogs the competition. we don't want to just be a copycat of what's already out there. so i'm super excited about that. we're tapping into talent outside of the industry. of course, we're leveraging our industry expertise. and we're not only just thinking about e-commerce from a today standpoint. we're also creating a modern tech stack that will be adaptable to our future needs. so it'll last not just one year or two years, but five years and 10 years.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
got it. thanks for all the color. and good luck.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
sure thing.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of john murphy from bank of america. your line is open.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys.
jeff dyke -- president, director
good morning.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
first question around sourcing used vehicles. and there's a -- there's a lot that seems to be shifting with lease returns and sourcing more and more online and away from these physical auctions. and it just seems like there's a lot of shifting here. so maybe getting beyond just like the next quarter or two, just thinking later this year or over the next five years, where do you envision sort of the bulk of your sourcing coming? how do you think it's shifting? obviously, you're trying to make it more efficient over time and lower cost transaction and pricing, both. i'm just curious, how you think about this and what kind of opportunity there might be for echopark and your franchise dealers?
jeff dyke -- president, director
hi, john, it's jeff dyke. so look, we're buying a lot of our inventory now through the auctions, and that is going to transition to us buying more and more cars off the street, and we're working on some different applications to -- as a part of steve wittman's comments that he made a second ago, to make it much easier for the consumer to trade a vehicle into us off the street.
and so, while that's a smaller percentage of our overall inventory today, less than 15%, we expect that to grow to north of 25% to 30% as we move forward and take more opportunities for consumers off the street. there's not -- we don't have a hard time buying inventory. in particular, in the one to four category, which is where the bulk of the inventory is, so there's no concern for us as we move forward on, can you get enough cars to support your 140 network, to support all of the franchise stores and everything that you do. we certainly will take a number of our cars in on trade. but most of those cars that we take on trade at echopark are moving over to our sonic stores, to our franchise stores where they are turning those cars really fast at higher margins, which has been a big -- a great thing for us and synergies between the two companies.
but there's no concern in terms of sourcing. the sourcing supply will shift over time to more cars off the street from our perspective than versus buying in the auction lanes or at the -- for the franchise stores at the closed sales.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
but do you envision a period of time where you're sourcing more than 50% of your new vehicle inventory through trades and off-street repurchases? i mean, you said 20% to 30%, i think it's your current comments, but i mean, could this be the majority of your vehicles at some point in the future?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. i think that it can be the majority in the future as long as that one to four-year-old supply is there. what tends to happen is the vehicles that you buy off the street for five, six, seven, eight-year-old cars, they're not the one to four-year-old cars, and that's echopark's model. and so, from a franchise perspective, sure. but on the echopark side, we'll continue to source a higher percentage through the auctions, through the manufacturers, through the rental car companies as we see opportunities because that low-cost product that we're looking for in that one to four category, that's our -- that's what drives our volume at echopark. and there are less opportunities to buy off the street in the one to four-year-old category than there are in the older cars.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. second question just on the carbiz and used car acquisition. it sounds like it's a way to really drive hyper growth into new markets. but how does the integration of those work? i mean, given that you have sort of standard model you're running your [indecipherable] you know exactly what you're dealing with, what you're getting and how you're doing it. when you're acquiring these stores, there's a whole lot of legacy assets, people, processes. how does that integration work?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah. it's a lot -- it's a lot easier than you might think because you don't have all the franchise baloney that we have to deal with on the new car side. very, very quickly, our buying system takes over, they're buying, and we're supplying inventory into both locations already. so we're filling that up. our training team is then putting in our playbooks and our processes. the great thing is, is we've got four really good facilities now in very, very good locations, one being in laurel, maryland, which is just a really good used car market. then we've got all the great people and the assets already on the ground. so now we have to do is go -- and they were already one price, they were already sellers trying to do some things that echopark does, but just hadn't figured out the formula. and what we're doing is just coming in and finishing the pieces of the formula, which is allowing us to really move a lot faster. and that's what's great in this evolution of echopark. as we're looking at these stores -- and there's plenty of them out there -- and we're thinking, well, gosh, we could go buy -- we could go buy a facility instead of having to go build and find and search for real estate and all that stuff, we could go buy a facility that is already in operation if it meets our standards, and they have -- they share in some of the same cultures and characteristics, and then convert those fairly easily and both leadership groups of both organizations -- as a matter of fact, they introduced this to each other are -- just snapped in real quickly. and as a matter of fact, one of the guys that we purchase is now running our distribution -- part of our distribution network in the delivery and buy centers. so it's a very exciting time for us because it's going to allow us to be even more efficient and more effective with less capital than what we were doing prior.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. that's very, very interesting. and then just lastly -- i mean, you kind of highlighted that the new vehicle market might be a little bit inventory-tight, gpus relatively strong for the first half of the year. it seems like that makes a lot of sense. just curious on the chip shortage side, if you're seeing any kind of shocks to production schedules and vehicles in transit that are not showing up just yet? or is that something you expect to be dealing with in the coming weeks and months as this thing really kind of hits? and then does end up being -- how positive is the -- is automakers focus on very rich mix and it's not such a bad thing?
jeff dyke -- president, director
look, at the end of the day, the manufacturers are learning and we're all learning. shorter date supply means higher margins and better turn rate, and the manufacturers then have to spend less on incentives. and so, i suspect that you're going to see a permanent change in our industry. i don't think that we'll ever get back to the high, high levels of inventory and slower turn. we're all pushing for that, including the manufacturers. the chip piece has not had an immediate impact. it's going to have an impact as we move forward over the next month or two. but again, remember, short supply has created all-time best run-in margins, very easy inventory management, and that fits right into our breadbasket because we've already -- that's how we're built is to really tight [indecipherable] supply everything, and makes it nice when the whole rest of the world has to do that. we all get to have better margins. so i think the industry is learning a big lesson here over the last 12 months with that.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
jeff dyke -- president, director
you bet.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of mark jordan from jefferies. your line is open.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
this is mark jordan on for bret. good morning.
jeff dyke -- president, director
hey, mark.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thinking about the franchise side, specifically the parts and service segment, are you able to provide a breakout for maybe each channel and where you see the largest headwinds to recovery there?
jeff dyke -- president, director
you mean service and parts and body shop?
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah, yeah.
jeff dyke -- president, director
so sure. i mean, we can get that to you after the call. at the end of the day, the body shop business is really defunct, a lot less driving, a lot less accidents. and so that's been a big struggle for everybody in the industry in total. and the parts business follows the service business and the service ros are down because people are not driving as much. and so we saw about a 4% decline in january, a 6% decline in the fourth quarter. we expect that -- and heath was saying this earlier on -- we expect that to really change as we move into the back half of the year. the vaccines are out, and people are getting more comfortable driving around. that's going to -- and traveling. that's going to make a big difference for us, and we expect the back half of the year to be much better from a fixed perspective than the first half.
danny wieland -- vice president, investor relations & financial reporting
yeah. this is danny. mark, adding to that. if you look at it from the segments, our customer base overall for the fourth quarter was roughly flat, down about 0.5 point [indecipherable] same store. but if you look at it from part and service, collision repair -- collision repair was down almost 20% in the fourth quarter. i think that's in line with what we've heard from some of the competitors in the space. wholesale parts is also down. you got lower activity in the service lines and our dealerships, the independent shops are certainly having the same or similar impact.
jeff dyke -- president, director
and mark, another thing to add to that is that the parts that the body shops are buying from our parts department. so certainly parts is off by that percentage as well.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. great. thank you. and then i guess switching over to echopark. just thinking about -- we've seen quite a few online-only used vehicle platforms emerge recently. can you maybe talk about how echopark differentiates from those platforms? and what advantages do you have by providing that physical footprint that the customers might want to visit?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yeah, sure. i'll start and steve wittman can chime in here in a second. but, as our data shows, 75% of the customers out there want to come touch and feel a car. and we think we have a physical footprint plan that will allow us to grow across the country very efficiently, capital-light, as heath was saying earlier. and so, in many cases, those online platforms are spending more capital than we are on physical plants, getting their inventory up and running. but at the end of the day, we feel like we have a very, very good plan, an effective and efficient plan to roll out our plant -- our facilities across the country and then provide our really cheap pricing from a used car perspective. and we're $2,500 to $3,000 cheaper than our average competitor in the one to four year-old market. and it's going to be very difficult to compete with that as we open up across the country and make that happen.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and this is heath. i'll just add, and jeff said it, but there's really -- for me, there's really three components that differentiates echopark from all the competitors. and number one, as jeff mentioned, is price. we have the cost structure that we can provide the lowest price and high-quality vehicles. and when you ask a consumer what they're looking for, the very first thing, from a used vehicle, price is the number one driver. so to me, the pricing strategy and our expense structure is the number one differentiator.
number two, as steve wittman discussed, the data says that people want to buy cars differently. and if you're going to be used only, you're going to miss out on a large percent of the population. if you're going to be a physical on-site only, you're going to miss out on a growing percent of the population. you have to have the ability to do both, and that is a strategy that wittman walked through, and that is our strategy to address the journey that the consumer wants.
and then the third component is operational expertise. i mean, we have demonstrated for years that we lead the industry in inventory management. we've got years and years of experience running automotive dealerships. so when you add all of those three together, the best price, the ability to buy the way you want and the expertise to operate, those are the things that differentiate echopark from the competitors from our perspective.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
and this is steve wittman, just to add on to that. we're designing our digital ecosystem in a way, number one, that's flexible, right? let the consumer dip in and out of the digital and physical world. the consumer doesn't view those as two separate things anymore, right? we've all been on the amazon and we've been in physical stores, and that's the way consumers think about digital retailing in the automotive industry. we're going to give them the ability to shop and to do whatever they want online from wherever they want. if they're sitting on the beach, we can let them shop their car there or if they're at their desktop at an office, we're going to let them shop their car there. so flexibility in being grounded in consumer needs and consumer understanding is key.
number two, that seamless handoff is very important. the consumer shouldn't notice when they get in and out of digital or physical. we're going to have the infrastructure so that if consumer fills out five steps online, they're able to pick up at step six when they talk to somebody in our ge -- in our call center or chat with somebody or go into our dealership. that seamless integration between digital and physical, without the consumer noticing, is critical to an outstanding consumer experience.
and then lastly, it's transparency, right? and this is all about keeping in line with the echopark equity, being transparent with our products and services online, also where our products exist, giving the consumer the opportunity to come in and touch, feel, smell the product that they want to or else do everything they want to online and looking at our cars and our products and services. so that flexibility, that seamless handoff and transparency are going to be hallmarks of our digital products.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and this is heath again. and we believe that -- you heard steve talk about -- steve wittman talk about, we are listening to the consumer, right, what they really want. and we believe that the leading indicator for long-term success is customer satisfaction. and i think if you look at our ratings, if you look at the customer satisfactions, you can see that we lead the industry, and echopark has phenomenal reputation from the consumer satisfaction perspective, and that's the leading indicator for long-term growth. if you meet the needs of the consumer, you're going to have long-term success.
jeff dyke -- president, director
and, mark, this is jeff. if you add to that, if you look at our greenville performance, greenville's got our highest nps, highest customer satisfaction scores already. so we're really excited about that because you're doing the entire transaction basically online other than state-regulated pen to paper and then delivering that car from one of our centers down to greenville where we have an office. and yeah, we have our highest satisfaction scores in that marketplace. so the customer is telling -- we're listening, as heath said, the customer is telling us yes, this is the right formula. this is exactly what we want. we love the experience.
most importantly, they love the price. and that's the big difference. if you can create the cost structure that supports your ability to run the price, $2,500 to $3,000 a car below retail, then it allows us to really expand and grow and to do that effectively and efficiently. so really good news early on for us coming out of our delivery and buy centers, and we look forward to updating you guys more as we roll out more.

operator
good morning and welcome to sonic automotive's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] presentation materials [technical issues] on the conference call, can be accessed at the company's website at ir.sonicautomotive.com.
at this time, i would like to refer to the safe harbor statement under the private securities and litigation reform act of 1995. during this conference call, management may discuss financial projections, information or expectations about the company's products or market or otherwise make statements about the future. such statements are forward-looking and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the statements made. those risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission.
in addition, management may discuss certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission. please refer to the non-gaap reconciliation tables in the company's current report on form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission earlier today.
i would now like to introduce mr. david smith, chief executive officer of sonic automotive. mr. smith, you may begin your conference.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
this is sonic automotive. that was very choppy from our perspective. i want to be sure that the listeners can hear. that must a bad connection.
operator
yes. everyone can hear.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
okay. thank you very much. good morning, everyone and welcome to sonic automotive's first quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm david smith, the company's ceo. joining me on the call today is our president, mr. jeff dyke; our cfo, mr. heath byrd; our executive vice president of operations, mr. tim keen; our chief digital retail officer, mr. steve wittman; and our vice president of investor relations, danny wieland. first, i would like to thank all of our teammates customers, manufacturers and vendor partners for helping us achieve another record quarter. during the first quarter of 2021, we continue to build on our strong momentum coming off record adjusted earnings in 2020. we generated record first quarter total revenues of $2.8 billion, up 21% on a year-over-year basis and record first quarter eps of $1.23 per share, tripling our adjusted eps of $0.40 per share in the first quarter of last year.
these results were driven by strong performance in our franchise dealerships, and another all-time record quarter for our echopark business, reflecting increasing consumer demand and continued execution by our team. i'm pleased to report positive trends in the first quarter have continued into the second quarter, and we continue to see strength in all facets of our business. we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth targets based on our current results and near-term outlook and the increasing number of americans that are receiving vaccinations and beginning a return toward normalcy.
given these trends in our progress to date, we are confident we can attain our goal of more than doubling total revenues to $25 billion by 2025. and significantly increasing profitability going forward. in our core franchise dealership segment, first quarter revenues were $2.3 billion, a 15% increase from last year. total franchise pre-tax income was $70.5 million, an increase of $47.9 million or 211% compared to last year. on a two-year comparison compared to the first quarter of 2019, same-store franchise dealership revenues increased 14% and pre-tax income increased by $49.8 million, which is a 240% increase, reflecting the impact of our lower expense structure as a result of strategic actions that was taken last year.
turning now to echopark. we continue to experience rapid growth during the first quarter, achieving all time record quarterly revenues of $507 million, which is up 53% compared to the same period last year. we also achieved record quarterly retail sales volume of nearly 19,700 units, which is up 41% year-over-year and ahead of 18,000 to 19,000 units we guided to on our february call. in addition to top line growth, we have to -- build of our echopark model that currently use vehicle pricing environment during the total gross profit per unit of $2,339 and above our target of $2,150.
our first active part delivery center in greenville, south carolina continues to outperform our model selling 160 vehicles in march at nearly $1,750 in total gross profit per unit. generally $100,000 and store level profit for the month. our outlook in the echopark stores and delivery centers also continue to ramp aggressively. with our phoenix hub selling 228 vehicles in its full month in march, driving $125,000 of store level profit. the unit ratio of december's used car acquisition is already ramping up nicely selling 300 plus in total gross profit per unit. and we continue to apply our learnings to each new echopark store we opened or acquired. and results are proving the scalability and momentum of the echopark model.
we believe these results showcase the flexibility, value proposition and consumer demand or echopark's unique pre-owned vehicle shopping concept as more guests choose to visit our stores and or shop echopark.com for the incredible inventory selection on diesel pricing and a unique guest experience that we offer. as an update on our expansion of echopark's nationwide distribution network and omnichannel retailing platform, we opened five new locations in the first quarter. in april, we opened our latest retail hub in birmingham, alabama and our third delivery center in charleston, south carolina. we remain committed to opening 25 new echopark locations in 2021 and we're on track for our 140 plus point nationwide distribution network by 2025, which we expect to retail over 0.5 million pre-owned vehicles annually by that time.
with our progress to-date and the continuing development of our omnichannel retailing platform, we are confident that we can reach $14 billion in echopark revenue by 2025. in addition to the year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, this morning's earnings press release includes comparisons to the first quarter of 2019 for certain key metrics. it's important to recall that sonic actually grew eps in the first quarter of last year compared to 2019 due to the strength of our january and february results despite the initial impact of the pandemic in march of 2020. since that time, we have substantially improved our expense structure, which was reflected in the current quarter's profitability and operating margins and our expectations for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
in the first quarter of 2021, total sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 72.2% representing a 830 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of last year and 790 basis points better than the first quarter of 2019 which in dollar terms, while same store franchise gross profit increased 34.5 [phonetic] last year, same-store franchise sg&a expenses decreased $7.5 million, demonstrating the permanent expense reductions we had previously [technical issues].
turning now to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $435 million in available liquidity and set an all time high liquidity mark in april at $570 million which included over $300 million in cash on hand. more recently, the company closed a new four-year $1.8 billion credit facility. the credit facility was substantially oversubscribed with strong support from both new and incumbent financial partners. we are very pleased with this transaction which has extended our debt maturities, improved our borrowing costs and raised our total available liquidity and fore-playing capacity to facilitate our growth plans.
reflecting our current business momentum, expansion of liquidity resources, i'm very pleased to report that our board of directors recently approved 20% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.12 per share payable on july 15, 2021 to all shareholders of record on june 15, 2021. additionally, the board increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million, bringing our total remaining authorization to $277 million.
in summary, our record first quarter performance reflects steadily increasing automotive retail demand as well as constantly improving operating conditions. echopark has rapidly become one of the leading success stories in the pre-owned automotive retail industry, and we look forward to continuing its rapid expansion in 2021. we expect to see continued strong demand for both new and pre-owned vehicles in the near term, which should drive further growth for our franchise dealerships and the echopark brand. at the same time, our efficiency improvements have enabled us and had enabled us to operate in a much leaner more profitable manner.
despite the challenges we all faced in the last year during this global pandemic, sonic and echopark has emerged as much stronger, more efficient organization. we are encouraged by our successes to-date and remain confident in our long-term strategic plans. this concludes our opening remarks and we look forward to answering any questions you may have. thank you very much.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from rick [technical issues].
rick -- analyst
[technical issues] thanks. good morning. great quarter. can you hear me, ok?
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
it's a little bit choppy rick [phonetic], but go ahead, we'll make new. yeah, yeah, i think that [technical issues].
jeff dyke -- president and director
yeah. so, rick, this is jeff. we ended the first quarter with a 43 basis point new car inventory. so we're certainly in good shape. i [indecipherable] three buckets. what's reinforcing domestic, domestic maybe the hardest. and i think may, it's going to be the toughest month in terms of that. digitally only about 12% of our business. so we're set up for the next couple of quarters as the strip issue becomes more of a problem, the luxury plus inventory, which obviously is a big chunk of our business and the biggest of our business. we're just not going to be as effective -- want a great job and product in from other parts of the world.
we got inventory -- and so we should enjoy good new car volumes through the second quarter and of course great margins. those margins are going to continue. i think will continue through the rest of the year. imports and domestic are going to get harder with domestic from our perspective to being the hardest. i think the start rolling into this [indecipherable] was getting a lot better, from the middle of june as we move forward. but again our luxury mix is going -- is really going to help us as we work through more difficult conditions in second quarter.
rick -- analyst
i have done [technical issues].
jeff dyke -- president and director
yeah. so, really what you're seeing with the echopark in the higher base supply is just a reflection of the number of stores and right now, we're carrying a lot of inventory to getting those stores open. but our main supplier, more materials stores is still quite normal 10 days in the pipeline, 20 days in the front line. and what [indecipherable] are actually quite circling up, wholesale is lagging retail, it's a little bit of pressure from a margin. but this is just -- you look at the business and what happens, january, february, march, april is just a fantastic month. speaking to the overall organization, i think it'll do better and more. it's just really, really good. and after this doing this for a long time, the last couple of months are something best, are retail month.
the auctions obtained more money for cars right now which is present, it's way up here to get. in particular in our 1 to 4 year-old category and our lots are pooled. our supplies are good and looking forward to a break even bigger second quarter than what you saw in the first quarter, continuing growth pattern to over 100,000 cars this year.
rick -- analyst
[technical issues]
jeff dyke -- president and director
thanks.
operator
your next question is from rajat gupta [phonetic] j.p. morgan.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning. hopefully, a little better [technical side] on the echopark [technical side] can you talk about [technical side] ebitda levels are just to match 2019 levels in 2021. [technical issues] given the start we have to the first quarter, strict memory, and it's [technical issues] like, guidance.
jeff dyke -- president and director
yeah. rajat, your questions is a choppy, but i think i got it. i think it's in relations to kind of the drag and the performace on echopork.where i wi.. just the to is our trial. you might have. yeah we your call. if your question was a little choppy. and so we're going to look at that, is we are ramping up echopark quickly. we gave you guidance in the beginning or at the end of last year, beginning of this year, february, that we're going to have about $12 million to $14 million drag. we only had $600,000 drag in first quarter, but we still expect to have that $12 million to $14 million drag for the year. and still sell more 100,000 cars are being store ramped a lot faster than we thought. we nearly hit 300 cars pro forma up in margin. we made $125,000. usually that's taking a couple of months to get that done or six months to get that done. we're just moving a lot quicker, that we've anticipated.
and if we can see that happening in birmingham, also ramping up a little faster. maybe there is some good news there, in terms of drag as we move forward. but our projection still right now, are still have that $12 million to $14 million range. and we can update you in the second quarter as to sort of what we're seeing on our newly opened stores, but certainly, the stores are opening right now are improving a lot faster than the stores that we opened last year. we just learned a lot. we're executing -- we have people in the pipeline to go out and meet our stores have been a really good, fully mature team in the phoenix, it's playing been for a while, and it was just like turn on the lights. we just went straight to -- almost 300 cars and made money, and hopefully we'll be able to do that more and more up as we move forward.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
and i think the one [indecipherable] five locations, we opened in the first quarter, four days for conversions in the applications we get in new york and in [indecipherable] margin. we won the benefit of the acquisitions [indecipherable] online, much more quickly, there's much less pre-opening much less. and the remaining 20 stores that we have this year will be more greenfield like phoenix, like birmingham, like charleston which we've opened in the last month or past.
so that's where the majority of drag comes from -- going to be back. and that's [indecipherable] of having the flexibility and doing the acquisitions versus during the traditional greenfield that we do in the echopark.
jeff dyke -- president and director
yeah. after that the synergies platform, it just topped on, hold over 300 margin profitable is immediately very, and we're hoping that and expecting that in our platform in baltimore.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. [indecipherable] that's big news [indecipherable] anything [indecipherable].
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
rajat, this heath byrd. really choppy. i think heard capital allocation. and again our [indecipherable] echopark will be the main area of capital allocation. but it is interesting, because of the success of the franchise and what we're seeing as well as how quickly echopark is becoming profitable and creating net ebitda even with the drag. we do see opportunity. we get a lot of opportunities for acquisition on the franchise side. and for the first time, we're starting to get a little more active on that side. and because of the free cash flow, we're producing, we got the opportunity to continue growing echopark as well as look at some of these opportunities on the acquisitions on franchise.
of course we raised the dividend, which were part of the capital allocation, 20% returning capital to shareholders and we think if the share repurchase authorization, i think you can see we bought almost 1 million shares back in q1 like $44. we believe it's undervalued. we believe it's undervalued now. and so opportunistically we'll continue looking at share repurchase as well.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
your next question is from mark [phonetic] [technical issues].
mark -- analyst
hi. on the echopark side as you move to increase your mix of purchases [technical issues].
jeff dyke -- president and director
hey, mark, this is jeff dyke. now, the problem with [indecipherable] when you're buying cars off the street, we have one to four year old model. customers are bringing one to four year old cars to sell. typically they're still upside down, whatever. so you can see, some of our competition is out there buying a lot of cars off the street. but they're buying 5, 15 year old cars, not one to to four year old cars. and majority of those cars are going to the wholesale markets [phonetic]. it is not -- it is a source for us.
and right now there's as a percentage of our overall sales has been 10% range. but this is not going to be a big, big source for us, because of the nature of the business and customers not selling that. one to two year old car straight off the street. our sourcing is coming from the auctions where we're buying a lot of vehicles. obviously, we're buying some of them off the street. and then we're enjoying, being able to buy some from our new car dealership. so the combination of all that allows us kind of to carry the inventory levels we've prepared.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and this is heath. i just add to this as well. as -- when we buy from the auctions, we have a very predictable product we buy and very high condition range. and so that allows us to keep the recon low, and to do it quickly. as you know we've returned the vehicle very quickly. and so you get very predictable source of supply depending on the street, you've got some of that, that take a lot more -- a lot more time to get through the line. so that's another component of why we focus on the auction.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
and that's one more thing we got. our trade ratio of echopark is running almost 70%. and so we are getting inventory from tranche. and then the great luxury of that is, the tranche that don't fit in one to four year old models are being moved over to our franchise side of the business. and we're selling the heck out of those bars. that's just a big home run for us.
mark -- analyst
okay, great. and then can you talk about the differences in f&i on the echopark side between customer that might show up in store and some of them are [technical issues].
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
i think you're saying that f&i had, i'm sorry to say, choppy, mark, i think you're saying that performance in f&i online versus in-store and -- that's the one thing that we've learned a lot about. it's -- we can sell up an iphone, particular when e-commerce platform comes along to make it even easier for our consumer to use our platform. you know we're going to be, we'll see that -- there's really not going be a big difference between the f&i, online versus f&i selling stores. and heath, can you do that?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
just to add to that. i mean that's exactly what we've seen the penetration with f&i products online, about the same even a little bit better than in-store. we offer that transparency to the consumer. they can really understand what the product does and how it helps them over the short and long-term.
mark -- analyst
okay, great. and then just any change on the part and service trend [technical issues].
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. that's been a great [indecipherable] story for us so far this year. we're running up against 19 [phonetic] in the first three months of the year, that up 9% in customer paying. our warranty is down about the same, but it looks even better, if we get into april, we're running at 15% in customer pay. and that's just a big home run. so we feel like fixed operations is back from a cpe perspective. and that's just going to be huge for us as we move through the rest of this year, in particular, the back half of last year where customers are really more traveling. they will be huge in california, and obviously, we have a good footprint. that california reopening will be a big addition to this. so far so good. that kind of growth in april versus 19, not 20 [phonetic] is really fantastic for us.
mark -- analyst
great, thank you.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and your next question is from john [indecipherable].
john -- analyst
good morning, guys. good morning.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
hi, john. good morning.
john -- analyst
[technical issues] the echopark inflection point, it sounds like it's right on the almost immediate horizon. is that sort of a second or third quarter event or is that more like '22 and '23, when enough stores have been open, opening 25 stores a year matters less on the cost ramp? i'm just trying to understand the inflection point on echopark.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
yeah, so '22, i mean, look, we are really having some great success with these stores we're opening right now, and getting them profitable and then selling right immediately the three year cars, but we're still opening more stores this year than we started the year with. and that'll be the last time that happens. so 22 is going to be the, there's really going to be the inflection point here, when you really start seeing the profitability compared carrying the drag and really not having as big of an impact on us which is doing right now. but it's -- on gas pedal, we know we have a model that produces both volume and profitability. we slowed down in order to speed up. we've done all that and we're going to have a bunch of stores this year, and echopark is really picking up. it's a lot of fun to watch. why years going into the -- we put a decade into getting this all right. we learned a lot and now we can reap the benefits back. and so -- it's just be a great year. even that we have that $12 million to $14 million for the drag, the inflection point comes in '22.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
john, it's heath. i think it's really important to emphasize that our team is really. we made so much progress in how we opened stores both the scalability of the -- the cost is going down and the speed to market is going up. but our training and the way we bring, as jeff mentioned earlier, the phoenix store track on those 300 cars in the -- and then the addition of the acquisitions are things still gives that we brought online quickly integrated. and they're now echopark stores and sort of the speed to market, i think, is a huge part of our growth story.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
the only thing i'll add more and more about john, the other thing we're doing is building our management bench and so there's a lot of and best going into that right now. we didn't see quite as much in the first quarter, but you're going to be more in the second and third quarter. i mean the 600,000 drag in the first quarter was just sort of under-stated. and that's why we told, that we'll still be in that range for the year. and if you want to look at anything sort of phoenix when we put the right management team to strengthen on day one. it just up and that's exactly what happened. and so, we're adding more and more people in order to help this aggressive rollout that is going to be added the rest of the year.
john -- analyst
you acticipated [technical issues].on human capital. what is the cost of developing general managers either internally or certainly externally for all the stores are being opened.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
net several layers of management, we have to basically at each layer continue to move up as we open stores. we've had a, going to be outside of a few times we bring them in six months early to looking at capacity in the stores for future openings. and so we're excited to schedule getting at it. that's part of the drag that jeff was talking.
john -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then just last one. on gross margin, just how sticky, could you just -- on the new side. i mean it seems like part of this size.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
i mean i think i understood your question, john. again, sorry, it's a little choppy. but the new car margin, one of the thing, that's great is the manufacturer for learning and have learned that they're going to, they're going to keep their supply side. the force announcement, bmw has made announcements and supplies are going to stay flat,, margins up. so i think more than stick and who knows, have been required is going to, they are right now but just, we're certainly not going back to pre-pandemic.i just see that happening. and the new store margins are good too. we sort of run at a little lower margin on the front, much higher margins on the back in many of our competitors and you combine that it gives us a total package on a per rig companies typically puts us in the top one or two of our competitors. and so i think you said margins are going to the stay strong. and remember in the echopark model, model is to have. our models drive traffic through in being $2,500 to $3000 price point of the retail market sort of wholesale price in retail. and so you're going to see us in that minus 100 to minus 300 sort of range that may move around a little bit depending on what's going on wholesale markets that certainly will continue to try to drive the big volumes in our model requires from an echopark perspective.
john -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
you bet.

such statements are forward-looking and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made. these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission. in addition, management may discuss certain non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission. please refer to the non-gaap reconciliation tables in the company's current report on form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission earlier today.
i would now like to introduce mr. david smith, chief executive officer of sonic automotive. mr. smith, you may begin your conference.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to sonic automotive's second quarter 2021 earnings call. as she said, i'm david smith, the company's ceo. joining me on the call today is our president, mr. jeff dyke; our cfo, mr. heath byrd; our executive vice president of operations, mr. tim keen; our chief digital retail officer, mr. steve wittman; and our vice president of investor relations, mr. danny wieland. we're excited to publicly announce today record-breaking operating and financial performance for our company during the second quarter of 2021.
this performance would not have been possible without the tremendous effort and execution by our valued sonic and echopark teammates. congratulations, and thank you all. we'd also like to thank our customers, manufacturers and vendor partners for helping us achieve another record quarter. during the second quarter of 2021, sonic continued to deliver exceptional performance in our franchised dealerships segment. we also posted a fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and retail unit sales volume for our echopark business.
on a consolidated basis, we reported all-time record quarterly revenues of $3.4 billion, up 59% year-over-year. when compared to the second quarter of 2019, to exclude the effects of the onset of the pandemic, total revenues were up 28%. we generated all-time record quarterly income from continuing operations before taxes of $151 million, up 303% on a year-over-year basis and up 310% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. we also reported all-time record quarterly earnings from continuing operations of $114 million or $2.63 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2020 earnings from continuing operations of $31 million or $0.71 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $28 million or $0.64 per diluted share.
these results reflect the strong consumer demand environment we've seen across all of our business lines since the latter part of 2020 but also showcase sonic's continued ability to maximize operating efficiency at our franchised dealerships as well as the continued successful expansion of echopark's nationwide network. we are confident that our strong operating performance can be sustained throughout the balance of 2021 and well into 2022, and we are well positioned to grow total annual revenues to $25 billion by 2025, while continuing to significantly increase our profitability.
in our core franchised dealerships segment, second quarter revenues were $2.8 billion, a 53% increase from last year, which reflects rebound in consumer demand since the height of the pandemic in 2020. gross profit for the second quarter was $475 million, up 69% from the prior year. total franchise pre-tax income was $165 million, an increase of $131 million or 375% compared to last year. same-store franchised dealership revenues rose 55% on a year-over-year basis, while gross profit was up 74%.
on a two-year comparison, same-store franchised dealership revenues increased 25%, while gross profit grew 40% compared to the second quarter of 2019. franchised dealership total variable gross per unit was nearly $5,100 per unit, up 43% year-over-year and up 58% from the second quarter of 2019, benefiting from strong vehicle margins and all-time record f&i per unit of $2,110. our franchised dealership performance has been enhanced by execution against our plan, including discipline around sg&a spend, focus on our parts and service business and our continued ability to efficiently manage our inventory.
looking forward, we remain committed to optimizing our franchised dealership business, both through organic growth initiatives and through strategic acquisitions. to that end, earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of subaru and volkswagen franchises in grand junction, colorado. these acquisitions enhance our brand portfolio and complement our overall growth strategy, and we expect to announce additional franchised dealership acquisitions in the near term as we drive toward $25 billion in total revenues by 2025.
turning now to echopark. the combination of our below-market pricing, efficient inventory procurement, logistics and reconditioning processes and digital-enabled sales channel has allowed us to offer tremendous value to consumers and our top line growth reflects this growing brand recognition. we generated all-time record quarterly echopark revenues of $596 million, up 89% on a year-over-year basis and a 104% increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. during the second quarter, echopark achieved all-time record quarterly retail sales volume of nearly 21,300 units, up 61% year-over-year.
on a two-year comparison, echopark retail unit volume increased 69% compared to the second quarter of 2019. we are already halfway to our echopark network expansion goal of opening 25 new locations in 2021. based on our success to date and plans for future markets, we expect echopark to achieve 25% population coverage by the end of 2021 and 90% population coverage by 2025. further driving our expansion opportunity, we have made excellent progress with our proprietary digital retail platform and are on track for our fourth quarter 2021 launch at echopark.
in the meantime, we continue to drive market share gains in our existing echopark markets and we anticipate our market penetration and brand recognition will continue to grow rapidly over the next decade as we expand our nationwide distribution network. looking now at market share in more detail, echopark has shown a consistent trajectory from launch, indicating that our expansion is performing to plan. within echopark's one- to four-year-old vehicle category, markets with echopark locations opened for less than two years average a 5% share; markets with echopark locations opened for two to three years average an 8% share; and markets with echopark locations opened for more than five years average a 14% share.
in addition, our below-market pricing drives sales opportunities on both ends of the one- to four-year-old spectrum, where we compare favorably on price to both new vehicles and five- to six-year-old vehicles, allowing us to expand our addressable market. in the longer term, we expect to continue to drive market share growth within echopark to an achievable target of 10% of that core market of one- to four-year-old vehicles networkwide, which, combined with the adjacent vehicle age segment, positions the business for a potential volume of two million units annually at maturity.
with our progress to date and the continuing development of our omnichannel retailing platform, we remain confident we can reach our interim goal of 575,000 units and $14 billion in echopark revenues by 2025. in addition to our top line results and continued expansion of echopark, our team remains committed to improving operating margins and managing expenses throughout the organization. in the second quarter of 2021, total sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were 62.8%, an all-time quarterly record and a 1,210 basis point decrease from 74.9% in the second quarter of 2020.
franchised segment sg&a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were just 58.1% in the second quarter, a 1,660 basis point decrease from 74.7% in the second quarter of 2020. on a two-year comparison, this represents a 1,900 basis point improvement from 77.1% in the second quarter of 2019. with this expense leverage, we realized second quarter adjusted ebitda margin of 5.7%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and a 280 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2019. these results reflect a permanent expense reductions we have previously communicated.
while current operating results reflect a higher gross margin environment due to constraints on new vehicle inventory, we do not expect new vehicle gpus to fully regress to pre-covid levels once inventories begin to build. assuming normalized new vehicle gpu of $2,500 and used vehicle gpu of $1,300, without assuming additional unit sales volume or further parts and service growth, our pro forma franchised dealership's sg&a is expected to be in the 62% to 63% range, representing a 1,000 basis point improvement from pre-covid levels as a result of the permanent changes in our expense structure.
in addition to operating expense leverage, we continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. we ended the second quarter with over $600 million in available liquidity, including approximately $315 million in cash and deposit balances on hand. during the early part of the quarter, as we mentioned on our last earnings call, the company closed a new four-year $1.8 billion credit facility which allowed us to extend our debt maturities, improved our borrowing costs and raised our total available liquidity and floor plan capacity at attractive terms.
with our available liquidity resources, we believe sonic is well positioned to continue executing on our echopark growth plans while also strategically investing in the future of our franchised dealership business and continuing to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. i'm pleased to report that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on october 15, 2021, to all stockholders of record on september 15, 2021.
in closing, our all-time record quarterly results demonstrate the company's continued focus on execution with strong franchised dealership performance, the continued expansion of echopark's nationwide footprint, and our success in maximizing operating efficiency throughout our organization, driving long-term earnings growth potential. our strategic growth plan is based on demonstrating unique value to current and future customers through our pricing, guest experience and growing nationwide reach at both echopark and our franchised dealerships. we believe that this consumer-focused approach will continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders and maintain sonic and echopark's position as leaders and in evolving automotive retail environment.
and before we turn the call over for your questions, i'd like to comment on today's announcement that the company has initiated a review process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for our echopark business. as detailed in our press release, working together with our advisors and our board, we will explore a range of value-creating alternatives for the business. no timetable has been established for the completion of the review and allow me to remind you that there can be no assurance of a specific action or outcome.
as the review progresses, we will remain committed to executing our accelerated expansion plan for echopark, bringing this unique and competitive offering to new markets to deliver value for our guests while also supporting the teammates that are central to cultivating the echopark experience. we are focused on continuing to build upon the positive momentum in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity ahead. as the review is ongoing, we will not speculate on any particular outcome or make any further comments related to the process.
this concludes our opening remarks. we look forward to answering any questions you may have. thank you very much.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens. please go ahead.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. great quarter. i'd like to follow up on this strategic alternative, curious what is prompting that review at this time.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
rick, this is heath. we're not going to comment any further than the statement that was in the press release as well as in the opening statements from david. and once the evaluation is complete, there may be additional comments. but at this point, i just wanted to make everyone aware that, that process was underway.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
so on the franchise side, we saw a pretty meaningful expansion. and at the echopark side, we saw declines in that gpu. can you help reconcile those differences?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes, rick, so why don't you take -- why don't we start -- this is kind of a long-winded answer, but why don't we start -- and let me refer you to slide 22 of the investor presentation that we released this morning. and i think that will really help us kind of answer this question. i'll give you a second to get there. so as you can see on the slide, when you look at weeks one through nine, we had really normal market conditions and normal echopark margins. but beginning in week 10, wholesale prices rose above average market retail prices.
and in my career, which is 25 years doing this, the market has never seen a wholesale price inversion of this length or magnitude at all. in early april, we then decided to make a strategic decision to drive volume and market share, but also mitigate losses by adjusting our pricing strategy up. as we move into the third quarter, market conditions are now beginning to return to normal, and we've returned to our normal pricing strategy that we were running in the first quarter. but however, we do have a 40-plus current day supply of inventory.
that's driven by new store openings. traditionally, we run 30-day supply, 20 on the front line and 10 in the back line. and so we expect margin pressure to continue through august. but as we approach the end of the third quarter, we expect echopark margins to begin to normalize. fourth quarter margins are going to look a lot like the first quarter. and as a result of the actions that we've taken, we do remain on track to sell the 100,000 to 105,000 cars that we told the street that we would sell at the beginning of the year. when you look on the franchise side, trade-ins make a big -- trade-ins make up a big percentage of our volume, about 60%.
and so we're obviously trading for cars a lot cheaper than we're buying cars at the wholesale line. about 88% of our cars come from the auctions at the echopark level where very few -- a much smaller percentage of our cars come at the franchised dealerships, and that speaks for the industry as well. everybody's got higher margins. but the exposure for echopark is, is that we buy a lot of wholesale cars at auctions and we keep a short-day supply.
so we're going to run into margin events when you have an event like this. the good news is these events have happened onetime in my 25 years and probably have happened one time in anybody that's on this call as well. so it's not a concern for us as we move forward. we believe things will return back to normal, and getting closer to normal as we go into the month of september, certainly into the fourth quarter and as we move on into 2022.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
got it. so curious also if you're expecting losses in q3 and q4, or do we shift to profitability? sort of forecast here would be helpful.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. here's how you would look at it. i think that the losses that you see and saw in the second quarter, they are going to kind of be relative in the month of july. we'll get a little better, but probably still show a loss in august. september should then turn positive. and in the fourth quarter, we'll be back at the run rates that you saw in the first quarter. so that overhang that we have, and we wouldn't obviously have an overhang if we weren't opening so many stores, but we're buying a lot of inventory right now. and we're just not going to adjust our strategy because of an event that happens once in a lifetime.
it's just not -- it's not something we're going to do. it slows the entire business down. we're going to continue to grow our share as david said in his opening comment. we have a five-year-old store. our most mature store in our most mature markets got 18% share in the denver market, and we're averaging really 14% share in anything over five years. so we're not going to slow that down for a onetime event. and we think we've made the right decision there. so a little bumpy road for july, august; things get a lot better when september gets here and then back to normal in the fourth quarter.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
also, i noticed you have an acquisition announcement today. we haven't seen one of those in a while. if you could speak to that and your appetite to acquire on the franchise side?
jeff dyke -- president, director
i mean, look, we're bullish on the franchise side of the business and the echopark side of the business. there are a lot of deals out there right now. and so we're strategically buying deals that fit our footprint or markets that we're going into. new markets like we announced with grand junction, although we're in the state of colorado. but there are a lot of opportunities out there right now. so -- and as david said in his opening statement, you're going to see more purchases from us on the franchise side as we move through the rest of this calendar year.
rick nelson -- stephens -- analyst
great. thanks and good luck everybody going forward.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thank you so much.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of rajat gupta with jpmorgan.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, great. thanks for taking the question. i know you don't want to give too much color on the strategic review, but in the event that there is a separation of the echopark business that might happen as one of the possibilities, is there any way you can frame for us or quantify the dissynergies that would be there in that event? any brief color on that would be helpful. and i have a follow-up.
jeff dyke -- president, director
no, we appreciate the question, but we really can't comment further.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. anything qualitative to keep in mind in terms of shared resources or auctions or anything like that?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
rajat, this is heath. again, we're not going to comment on any of the details. i can just assure you that just like every decision that we make in this company, our focus is on increasing shareholder value and releasing as much value in this company as we can. and so that's the driver of every decision we make. but other than that, we just won't get into details of that analysis.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
no worries. i had to try. just a -- and the two million units at maturity, what kind of ebitda margin profile can the business run at? the 2025 targets imply like somewhere in the low single digits, but you're still ramping up stores at that point. so any color on what kind of ebitda margins or profitability of the business can be at maturity?
danny wieland -- investor relations
yes, you're going to see -- you're going to continue to see expansion of that, in particular, based on what we projected in 2025. that's based on an immature store set. so as we run those out toward maturity and you get a more mature store base, you'll see continued expansion beyond what that is there. we have not quantified what that opportunity or upside is. but i think the basis for echopark is that we were able to scale and leverage those expenses dramatically better and more efficiently than we are on the franchise side. and so we should see meaningful upside to ebitda margin as you get north of 575,000 units and continue to mature the store base.
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. and to danny's point, we've always talked about how the expenses at echopark are more fixed. and so obviously, that's going to drive a higher ebitda margin as we scale.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. and any color on like what the matured stores, what kind of ebitda margin there? obviously, keep taking into account the onetime hit this quarter on gpu, but -- any reference to that?
jeff dyke -- president, director
so i guess the best way to look at it is sg&a is going to be in the mid-50s to 60% range, somewhere in that ballpark for a mature store.
danny wieland -- investor relations
if you go back to...
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. okay.
danny wieland -- investor relations
if you go back to what our two most mature markets, denver and dallas, did in 2019, pre-covid, both -- each of those markets did $12 million in pre-tax. and so if you think about them running at, i think, that year was 1,300, 1,400 units a month on average. so if you look at it from that perspective, ebitda is going to be somewhere north of that $12 million into that revenue base.
jeff dyke -- president, director
and during that time frame, the share in those markets was lower. denver is running last month -- the present month of june, we ran 18% market share there. so it's a much more mature market now, and we don't know where that share can go. we're calling out 10%, which is driving the $2 million, but our stores are at five years at 14%. so there's certainly upside to that number, and i think that's a critical thing to think about as we move forward.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. just one last one. on the sg&a side, you gave us some color on the franchise business in the context of like what gpus could look like. just looking at the second quarter number, the 58% for franchise unit gross. it looks like the leverage or the drop-through to the bottom line from the gross profit increase just seems to be much higher for you versus what we've seen at some of the peers, almost like 75% to 80% drop-through of that gross profit benefit. is there something different?
or are there any changes that you have made over the last year when you were laying off -- when you laid off some staff that -- has there been any change in terms of the fixed sources variable comp model or anything of that sort that would lead to this kind of a drop through? just curious if you could share any thoughts there. that would be all.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. this is heath. a couple of things. i missed a little bit of it, but i just want to -- and david hit on it very well in the opening comments. we -- first of all, on a high level, i think we had actually had guidance in february of around 73% for 2021, for the year, we're running at 66%, 67%. and we -- for this year, we absolutely expect that to be our sg&a percent of gross at that level, not the higher 73%. if you look forward, david articulated this and tried to normalize what we expect to see in 2022, where you -- we still believe that gpu is going to be elevated on new, you normalize the used. we are looking at a 62% and that includes echopark and the franchise business.
and so as the echopark matures, we can actually improve that even better than the 62% range. but a couple of things that are driving the throughput. we've got -- if you look at our productivity on our sales associates, for example, we used to sell 12 units per month for associate before these cuts that we put in place and these efficiencies, now we're running 18, 19. and so that's a fundamental change that you can see even at these new levels we're maintaining.
and so that's a big part of it that is changes -- structural changes that have been made in organization. the other one is centralization of advertising, a huge component to our sg&a that is a structural change that's allowing that throughput to happen. we're spending a lot less on advertising, and it's even more effective. and so those are two of the biggest that are the structural changes are driving that throughput.
jeff dyke -- president, director
it's not just a gross-driven event. it's a gross and expense-driven event, and we made a big deal out of that during covid saying we really did take a lot of expense out of this business. i think we quoted $84 million annually that's come out. it's running higher than that. and it's permanent, as david said in his opening statement. and so when you're looking at your models and forecasting for next year, you really got to take that into consideration in terms of how you look at the business. and then the great news there is -- and i don't know if you mentioned this or not, heath, but our california market is really underperforming in a big way compared to the rest of the markets.
the market has just not come back as fast due to covid. so if you look at our new car volume in california, it underperformed the rest of our stores by 1,000 basis points; used car volume down by 1,400 basis points, fixed up 600 basis points; total revenue was down by 1,300 basis points and gross profit down by 1,000 basis points. as california opens back up, it's just going to -- it's going to be fantastic for us. we've got a big chunk of our stores and our business out there. and so that's going to further enhance the gross portfolio, but it's also going to continue to lever the sg&a percentage down. so it really is coming from both sides. and the great news is, is we can have the new car margins return -- i don't think they're going to return to pre-covid levels.
again, i think the manufacturers are doing a smart job by keeping inventories tight and they'll continue to do that even as we move forward. so if you do model a $2,500 pvr, which is still well ahead of where we were at pre-covid, you get to have the gross growth and you get the big expense reductions that are permanent, again, in place, and that's just going to keep the sg&a coming down. then you add on top of that the performance of echopark getting back out of this crazy inversion time that we went through into picture, just works really, really good for us.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and that's why -- this is david. and that's why i noted that assuming no additional unit sales volume in that or further parts and service growth, we're being conservative in these projections.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and i think -- i think that's -- look, it's some of the models i've seen from -- on some of the analysis on line and sell side. from our perspective, i think what is being missed is that the power of that sg&a reduction staying in place. i also think that some people are assuming that we go back to pre-covid gpus which, from our perspective, as jeff mentioned, we think that will be elevated continuing. and at least from our company specifically, the models are not giving echopark any credit. and as we've mentioned many times, 2022 is the tipping point of echopark. that's when we are going to be opening less stores than we have opened. and so i think when we look at some models that really don't jive with ours, those are the things i think they're missing.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. hello?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes, we can hear you. go ahead.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes. i think i missed like the last few seconds when you'd cut off, but i can read the transcripts. so thanks for the color. [technical issues] the store openings versus...
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, i was just saying that as we look at some of the models from some of our buy and sell-side analysts and when it doesn't really jive with from our perspective, the things that i think are missing are the understanding of the permanent reductions that will continue regardless of any increase in volume, number one. number two, the assumption that new gpu goes back -- that the manufacturers go back to the 60-day supply, 65-day supply and the new gpu goes back to 2019. from our conversations, as jeff mentioned, that's not going to happen.
those will be elevated, continuing. the impact of california, at least specifically for us, and what is going to happen to the second half of '21 and into 2022. and again, echopark. echopark is that -- 2022 is our inflection point or tipping point where we are opening less stores than we have matured. and as we stated before, we believe that is when the profitability, even though we have it today, it starts going exponentially because you've got so many mature stores in place.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. great and thanks for all the color and good luck.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
you bet. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john murphy with bank of america.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. you've answered a lot of my questions, but i'll ask just one or two more. you mentioned two million units is sort of the target for echopark at maturity. and i think, jeff, you were saying there are some markets that that's based on 10% more market share on your target vehicles. but there are some markets you're 14%, 15%. i mean could this be the kind of thing where this is not $2 million, it's $3 million. and then if you decide to expand in the iceberg or maybe slightly older vehicles, or expanding the offering that you might be something significantly larger than that? i mean how are you paying this $2 million other than just 10%? what's the opportunity beyond maybe that?
jeff dyke -- president, director
yes. i mean if we take the five-year average, right -- the five-year-old store average right now is 14%. so the number is bigger than $2 million. and yes, it could be $3 million, $4 million. at the end of the day, we're always looking to take the inventory process that we have at echopark into pricing model and to expand that. i would think of it differently. i don't think we expand into five, six, seven, eight-year old cars because it brings a lot of complexity to the model that really doesn't fit our model, adds cost and things of that nature, that just doesn't fit the model.
but what you might think about is instead of the traditional echopark -- less this crazy time, traditional echopark average retail price being $20,000 to $21,000, you might look at something was, ok, can they expand that to a $35,000 to $40,000 car? and so -- because that's not an average retail selling price we come anywhere near. and we're -- look, we're always looking at how can we take this great model that we have, the efficiency that we have with the model, which is really exceptional and one of a kind, i think, in our industry and expand that to grow echopark to further levels?
so -- yes, the $2 million is a good, safe number for us because we know we're going to be above 10% in terms of market share. and we understand what our defined market is. it's a smaller swim lane. it's not the traditional 40 million to 43 million cars being sold every year. it's a smaller lane, but we can own a much larger percentage of that lane than what some of our competitors are talking about of the overall marketing. so i think you're thinking right. and it's absolutely the way that we're thinking.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and also you can think about because of our pricing strategies, part of that $2 million, which could be a lot higher numbers, we're pulling that five- and six-year-old buyer into the one- to four-year old because we are priced so low that now they can afford a one to four rather than a five to six. that adds to our tam. we're also pulling from new car buyers because i've got a one- to four-year-old car with a conditional report of 4.5. it's just as good -- i mean it's just as good as a new car. and so i'm pulling from that $13 million as well. so we feel like we're going to have some migration from those other populations into the one to four because of the way we price.
jeff dyke -- president, director
and we do today. that's part of our volume today, and we expect that to continue to expand with our pricing model as we move forward. we see that happening, and that's part of the big share, like i quoted for denver, that we've got an 18% market share there in the one to four category, but it includes some five- and six-year-old vehicle buyers because the price is so low, and it includes some new car buyers because we're 40% priced below the new car traditional number. so all in, a great opportunity for us. and again, i think you're thinking right.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
and then just a second question. i'm not sure you can -- you're going to be willing to answer this, but i mean, you said 88% of echopark units are sourced from auction. will that be the case over time? and are the other 12% flowing from your franchised stores? i mean i'm just trying to understand that inventory -- i mean you're sourcing two million units, you start getting into, obviously, just simply big numbers, big chunks of the market. so i mean does the sourcing strategy stay the same over time at echopark?
jeff dyke -- president, director
it's really not a strategy. at the end of the day, we buy as many cars off the street as we want, but just think about it. it's not a lot of customers trading in a one- or two-year-old car. and they're still upside down, have negative equity whatever. it's just not as big a swimming pool as you might see for our franchise stores or some of our competitors where we're selling zero- to 10-year-old cars, and the average card on the road is eight, nine years old, and we trade for those cars all the time, that drives the margin that you see on the franchise side. so yes, i think can expand. if you look when we first started, that number was 6%, 7%, 8%.
we've got it up to 12%. we've got -- i think we have some opportunities there, but i don't think it's going to be as big a percentage overall of our sellable inventory as you might see at some of our competitor set or even our own franchise stores. and we really don't -- we don't take cars from the franchise stores and move to echopark. we do the other way. cars that don't fit the echopark model, we send to our franchise stores, and they benefit greatly from that. but it's certainly every day, a topic of conversation for us is how do we increase the 12% because the margins are significantly better on a street purchase than they are buying a car at the auction.
and one other point, we're not -- i mean i hear people all the time talking about not being able to buy inventory. we don't have -- we've never had a problem buying inventory. we haven't had a problem. when everybody says inventory is tight right now, we don't have a problem buying inventory. you got to pay for it, and that's going to adjust the margins. but it's -- what we're not going to let that do is slow us down. the business is strong enough now that we're going to continue to power through.
and when you have events like we had over the summer here, it just is not -- it's not a big enough event to worry us. we're going to continue to power through, drive our market share because we come out the other side of this, we're going to be a lot stronger for it. so we don't have any problems getting inventory. i want to make sure that i get that point across.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
yes. and this is david. and simply to think about it and related to that is, as we grow our brand, our echopark brand and the markets, you can see there our market share increases, but so do the number of quality trade-ins that we get that actually fit the echopark model that we then go and resell. so we definitely see that -- those numbers growing.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, i mean, there's a core part of the business which is still a very, very good business outside echopark. i mean -- we're -- i mean do you have any designs about where that lands? i mean you've given us an idea of two million units, but like obviously, there's some upside there on echopark. i mean where do you think that the core business -- the core franchise business goes over time? how do you think about where that could top out or where you go when you're making acquisitions?
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
well, there's a number of ways to answer that, and i know jeff will have some comments on that. but the franchise business is still extremely fragmented in this country. and so there's still tremendous opportunity for growth in that area, which we alluded to that in our opening comments.
jeff dyke -- president, director
also, john, we've just never been in a position to grow, right? we just haven't had the liquidity. we've been shoring up our business. this team has been together since the end of '18. and so we positioned the company now from a liquidity perspective, we can kind of do what we need to do to grow in the franchise business and continue to grow echopark. and so now you're going to see us dive in there. we said that in the opening, we've got more franchises coming. we want to grow the business. it's a great business.
like you said, it's highly profitable. we really have our house in order when it comes to our liquidity, and heath can comment on that here in just a second, but also from an operational perspective. the turnover from our general manager turnover is 5% or less, the company has really strengthened its performance. our playbook processes are really -- have matured. and so it's time to grow the business, and we're in a position to do that now.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer, director
and there's been some deals that just want to emphasize, too, that we absolutely look at the roi of our -- of all of our investments. and so there have been some deals that we've passed on that just did not represent a great investment versus the investment in echopark. but we think as we move forward, we're seeing more and more opportunities to get -- for great acquisitions that are accretive and will add a lot of value for our shareholders.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and if you look at it from a balance sheet perspective, our leverage ratio is extremely low. our credit profile is improving from the agencies on a daily basis. so we've got ready available access to the capital markets for additional needs if necessary.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
i mean would it be -- actually, just a follow-up on this. i mean you look at autonation, it's about 2% of the market. you got lithia making acquisitions pretty aggressively, talking about getting about 5% of the market. i mean would you ever -- i certainly can't put you on the spot right now because i'm sure -- well, you might have some ideas about this. so i certainly ask of where you could be as a percentage of the new market, right?
because you're sitting here saying it can be 10% of the addressable market i'm going after in echopark. i mean could you say 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% in the new vehicle market? is that something you'd be willing to put out at some point? is it a target? or is this going to be just more opportunistic and you're going to roll up as you see fit over time?
jeff dyke -- president, director
well, look, we just dove back in the pool, right? and so that's a number i'm sure that we'll come with because there's just a ton of buying opportunities out there right now and you see our competitors buying, and you'll see us do the same, in particular, between now and the end of the year. and so yes, i think at some point in time, we can define that. but we're really kind of starting to hit our stride from an m&a perspective. and so give us a few quarters, and we'll begin talking a little bit more about that as we kind of define how many of these stores we're going to buy and where we're headed with this.
john murphy -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you very much guys.
jeff dyke -- president, director
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of mark jordan with jefferies.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my questions. i guess following up on the m&a question. can you kind of talk about what multiples you're seeing now and how they compare to historical trends?
jeff dyke -- president, director
it's -- they're different all over. it really depends on the brand and the markets that you're in, but -- i mean if you're going to go out and buy a porsche store, you're going to pay north of a 10 multiple. and -- but if you're buying some of the domestic or imports, it's five, 5.5, six, somewhere in that ballpark we're seeing. and it really does depend on the market, the city. there's just so many different issues with narrowing it down on a kind of a nationwide basis because those numbers are different all over the place. and i think you would hear that from our competitive set as well.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. and i guess following up on the echopark gpu question from earlier. it looks like in the quarter, you took some pricing up, i think, above market to kind of offset some of those wholesale headwinds. so when we get back to more of a normal sourcing environment, is this maybe kind of an opportunity to rethink the pricing model or maybe just be a little bit above where you have been historically for echopark?
jeff dyke -- president, director
you know it's an interesting conversation because what it showed in this time frame is the strength of the brand. because we got as high as 108%, 109%, 110% of the market during the time frame, trying to balance the loss and maintain our numbers in terms of share. so down the road, as the brand strengthens, and the guest gets to experience more than just price, that they get to experience just the great experience that you get coming into the store. and then we introduce in the fourth quarter, our digital retailing platform in our new websites are just going to be fantastic, there is definitely going to be opportunity for margin expansion.
we have not defined that yet, but you will continue to see us stay very aggressive versus the market. that's our bread and butter. and that to -- could we go from 2,500 to 3,000 below market down to 2,000 below market and still get the same kind of market share that we're seeing today. we will definitely play with those numbers as the brand expands across the country and becomes a nationwide known brand. and i might have steve wittman just comment quickly on our digital retailing platform.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
yes, sure. so we've taken a two-pronged approach to e-commerce here at sonic automotive. in parallel, we are improving echopark.com and building our proprietary digital retailing tool. our proprietary digital retailing tool is on track to launch in q4 of this year. we have a big team of over 50 people of designers, developers and product owners who are working on that right now. and that's really set to deliver a true end-to-end experience for the consumer, without having a lot of human intervention like a lot of our other tools out there have.
in parallel, we're improving echopark.com. so echopark.com, visits are up 156% versus a year ago, leads are up 111% versus a year ago, and our cars sold from our website are up 74% versus a year ago. so we're improving echopark.com every single day. and we've actually, for the first time in may and then june and july, we actually generated more leads from echopark.com than we did from our third parties, just shows the strength of the website and also shows the strength of our brand.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst

i would now like to introduce mr. david smith, chief executive officer of sonic automotive. mr. smith, you may begin your conference.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. welcome to sonic automotive's third quarter 2021 earnings call. as she said, i'm david smith, the company's ceo. joining me on the call today is our president, jeff dyke; our cfo, mr. heath byrd; our executive vp of operations, mr. tim keen; and our chief digital retail officer, mr. steve wittman; and our vice president of investor relations, mr. danny wieland. we're very excited to announce another record-breaking quarter. this performance would not have been possible without the amazing effort and execution by our sonic and echopark teammates. congratulations, and thank you all.
we would also like to thank our customers, manufacturer and vendor partners by helping us achieve another record quarter. during the third quarter of 2021, sonic delivered another quarter of record revenue and an 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year eps growth. on a consolidated basis, we posted record third quarter revenues of $3.1 billion, up 21% and record third quarter gross profit of $472 million, up 25%, driven by strong performance across the board and new used fixed operations in f&i. going beyond our top line growth, our third quarter results continue to validate our permanent expense reductions, achieving record third quarter sg&a expense as a percentage of gross profit of just 68.1%. on a franchised dealerships segment basis, though, sg&a as a percentage of gross profit was just 60.1%, a 760-basis point decrease year-over-year and down from 76.9% in the third quarter of 2019.
turning to earnings, we reported record third quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations of $112 million, up 39% year-over-year and earnings from continuing operations of $85 million or $1.96 per diluted share. diving deeper into our core franchised dealerships segment, third quarter 2021 revenues were $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year, which reflects the ongoing recovery in consumer demand we've seen since the high since pandemic. on a same-store basis, franchised dealerships third quarter revenues were up 11% year-over-year, while gross profit improved by 27%, driven by a record new and used vehicle gross per unit, a 21% increase in customer pay fixed operations gross profit and all-time record franchised segment f&i gross profit per retail unit, up $2,303, up 27% from the third quarter of 2020.
as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions that limited new vehicle production and inventories, we believe that third quarter new vehicle unit sales volume was negatively impacted by the low supply of new vehicle inventory despite continued consumer demand. our franchised dealerships new vehicle inventory was approximately 2,400 units or just a 10-day supply down from nearly 13,000 new vehicles at this same time last year. comparatively, used vehicles inventory was in line with our target level of 27 days supplying or 8,200 units. turning now to our echopark business. we reported all-time record quarterly revenues of $663 million, up 72% from the prior year and representing our fifth consecutive quarter of record echopark revenues. we achieved record third quarter echopark retail sales volume of 21,255 units, up 41% year-over-year. during the third quarter of 2021, echopark market share increased 110 basis points to approximately 4% of the one to four year-old vehicle segment in our current markets.
at the end of the quarter, echopark used vehicle inventory was approximately 9,800 units for a 41-day supply. for the third quarter, we reported an echopark pre-tax loss of $32.9 million and adjusted ebitda loss of $28.5 million. this includes new market-related losses of $18 million and $16.8 million, respectively. the effects of new vehicle inventory shortages have continued to drive used vehicle wholesale pricing higher, which negatively impacted echopark margins and profitability in the near term. while we continue to strategically manage our pricing and volume amid this temporary disruption in the used market pricing environment, we remain very confident that echopark margins and profitability will rebound once these market conditions normalize, which we anticipate will occur in mid-2022.
despite these short-term challenges, we continue to believe in the long-term potential of the echopark brand and remain very committed to growing our nationwide distribution network. with our progress today, we remain confident in attaining our goals of 25% population coverage by the end of 2021 and 90% population coverage by 2025. in addition, the launch of our proprietary digital retail platform at echopark continues to progress, and we remain on track to go live by the end of this year and roll out to our entire network in early 2022. as we announced earlier this month, the echopark team is pleased to welcome dino bernacchi, chief marketing officer; and thien truong as chief revenue officer. the addition of these key roles to our team reflects our continued focus on executing our long-term growth plans at echopark, and we are excited to see their expertise contribute to echopark's promising future. returning now to our franchise business.
we recently announced several strategic acquisitions to further accelerate our growth plans in september, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire rfj auto partners, a top 15 u.s. dealer group by total revenues. with 33 locations in seven states and a portfolio of 16 automotive brands, the transaction will add six incremental states to sonic's geographic coverage and five additional brands to our portfolio, including the highest volume, chrysler dodge jeep ram dealer in the world and dave smith motors. this acquisition, which is expected to close in december of this year, is projected to add $3.2 billion in annual revenues to the company, which are an incremental to sonic's previous stated target of $25 billion in total revenues by 2025.
in addition to rfj auto during the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of bobby ford, audi subaru and volkswagen franchises in colorado, further enhancing our automotive sales and service network in that state. more recently, we continued the expansion of our franchised dealerships network with the acquisition of bobby ford, chrysler dodge jeep ram in the greater houston market. turning now to our balance sheet. we ended the third quarter with $618 million in available liquidity, including approximately $320 million in cash and 425 was on hand.
more recently in connection with our pending acquisition of rfj auto, we announced a significant upside to our credit facilities, increasing total capacity to $2.95 billion and completed an oversubscribed senior note offering with an aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion, capitalizing on the favorable market conditions and an upgraded corporate credit rating to refinance our existing debt maturities at attractive terms with lower borrowing costs. these transactions demonstrate the strength of our business and positive outlook for the future as we continue to expand our nationwide reach and maximize operating efficiencies across our operations.
with our improved balance sheet and additional liquidity resources, we believe sonic is well positioned to pursue further growth opportunities in our franchised dealerships business, as well as to keep executing on our echopark growth plans. lastly, given our strong balance sheet, i'm pleased to report that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on january 14, 2022, to all stockholders of record as of december 15, 2021.
in summary, our quarterly results reflect sonic's continued operating improvements despite industrywide challenges stemming from the pandemic. these results demonstrate ongoing strong consumer demand, tremendous improvements in our franchised dealerships performance, our success in maximizing operating efficiencies throughout our operations and our teammates unwavering dedication to delivering for our guests. going forward, we will continue to execute on our strategic growth plans in both our franchised dealerships and echopark business segments, including the rollout of our new digital platform beginning this quarter. we believe that by following this course, we will continue to achieve strong revenue growth, increased profitability and build long-term value for our shareholders.
this concludes our opening remarks, and we look forward to answering any questions you may have. thank you very much.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question today comes from john murphy of bank of america. john, your line is open. please go ahead.
john joseph murphy -- bofa securities -- analyst
good morning guys. i just wanted to ask a first question around cap allocation. obviously, the acquisition of rfj is sort of a major reentry into the acquisition realm on the new vehicle franchise side that you kind of steered clear off for a while. just curious, as you think about the cascade of capital that business generates and redeployment of it, how do you think about the priorities now? because previously, it's kind of been all echopark and then internal reinvestment and other shareholder actions. but how should we think about that now? because this is a big one, obviously, right? it's like a good deal, but it's a very big one, and it might signal our transition and strategy here.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
this is david smith. i think that we need to emphasize the unique nature of the rfj acquisition. and i'll ask jeff dyke to expand on that. but it's -- we think, a fantastic value and a great use of our cash.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes, john. first of all, in the last couple of years, call it four or five years, we've just not been in a position liquidity-wise to go out and expand both echopark and our franchised business. it was never that we didn't intend to expand our franchise business that was always there, but we were busy shoring up our balance sheet, paying off debt and positioning ourselves. so that when the day did come and the consolidation did start -- restart, as i should say, in the industry, we can take advantage of that. and we've done that. rick ford and i go back 25 years. we worked together at autonation. we certainly work together at sonic automotive. we recruited here, along with his management team. and so as you look at capital allocation, we portend i know people want to comment here. but at the end of the day, we have the ability now to battle two fronts. we're going to continue to grow our franchise business. we have other acquisitions that we're planning that we've been working on. and we're very excited about growing our echopark business. as david said in his opening notes, we're going to have 25% coverage of the market by the end of this year, and we're on track to have 90% coverage of the market by the end of '25. and so that's a real exciting time for us, in particular, if you're an investor in sah because of echopark and the growth that we see there. we're very, very excited about the brand. so we're going to fight both battles. when there's an opportunity for us to add a franchise business and it meets our needs and where we are geographically, then we'll do that. and then, of course, we've been very clear in upfront about what we're going to do with echopark and our growth model there. heath?
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i'll just reiterate that your point is exactly right. we have a strong balance sheet and the internal resources to fight both battles. we've always been a consolidator and a growth on the franchise side. we now just have the ability to do that a little bit more aggressively. on the echopark side, it's a capital-light business model. it doesn't take that much capital to continue growing that. so that will be one of our priorities, obviously. we will be looking at opportunistic acquisitions, the ones that fit, that are accretive and also allow us to do that without having a material impact on our leverage ratio. we don't intend to lever up to do another large deal anytime soon. we have a ceiling of 3.5. we'll never go over that. if you actually look at the rfj acquisition. it's less than one turn on our most restricted leverage ratio. so we're going to continue to maintain that strong balance sheet. after that, even included with that is obviously invested in the current -- the businesses on both sides. that includes facilities. we're doing significant investments in our digital retail platform. we're also investing in technologies that will enable us to continue these efficiencies and reduce our sg&a like robotic process automation, things that will actually continue to get that sg&a as a percent of gross down. and then, of course, the return to capital to shareholders, we will continue our regular dividend program, and we will opportunistically look at share repurchases. we think the price we think this year is greatly undervalued. and so we will always continue looking at share repurchase as an opportunity to return capital to shareholders.
john joseph murphy -- bofa securities -- analyst
okay. and then just -- that's very helpful. i mean then a follow-up. i mean, should we view this acquisition and the pickup in the pace or the focus here on new dealership acquisitions as maybe a sign that you may be leaning in the direction of separating echopark? or is that reading too much into this, and that's not associated with this review process of alternatives for echopark?
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
yes, this is david smith. we cannot comment any further on our previously disclosed announcement about echopark, and we'll just leave it at that, if you will, please. we're just not legally allow to expand on it.
john joseph murphy -- bofa securities -- analyst
got you. okay. and then just lastly on echopark. i mean it seems like you guys are highlighting the tightness in the used market as a little bit of a disruptive force there for echopark, but in your core your new vehicle franchise dealers and other new vehicle franchise dealers, the used business has been doing fairly well. so i'm just curious as far as why you think that is? is it just a question of sourcing more from auctions and you just have better flow from trade-ins, it's not disruptive to the franchised used side of the equation? and what's the delta in the two businesses there? and how long do you think that lasts?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes. so john, this is jeff. no question. i mean the franchise business, we're 80%, 85% trades or what we're retailing at the echopark side, we're buying 80%, 85% of our inventory through auctions because that's where the one to four year-old models are. it doesn't mean we're not trying to buy off the street. that represents about 12% of our overall business and continues to be in that range. but we're -- if i could refer you to slide 20, if you look at that, you can see some of the things we've done from july to september to mitigate margin loss. we have raised our prices a bit in echopark. and we expect this -- this is going to be a little bit bumpy. and we expect the next two to three quarters we'll begin to see the separation as new car inventory comes back between wholesale prices and retail prices. but it's a really exciting time for us at echopark. there's a lot of great things that we're doing. and i was talking -- like i said earlier, by the time we get to '25, you got 90% coverage of the country. we're selling only 600,000 cars. and the most exciting thing is as when we get to the end of this quarter, we're going to launch our new website and e-commerce platform, and i'll let steve wittman comment just a few comments on that.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
yes, sure. absolutely, we will launch our new echopark.com in this quarter with what we believe it is the best in the industry into a retailing tool. and what that means is that the consumer will be able to go end-to-end online with a real deal, paying perfect payments and financing options and payment options. we'll have real online document signing, which is in the experience and the consumer experience online, which nobody else in the industry has. lastly, we'll being able to let the consumer kind of go that hybrid model, where they can start online and finish in store. our data tells us that about 75% of consumers really want that hybrid model. our digital retailing tool will enable both end-to-end and hybrid. and really, this is enabled without any human involvement. so the sale done using ai as well as robotic process automation. so net-net, we're on track to deliver. we're delivering in this quarter and it will be an accelerator to our business.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
so john, whether you're an investor for the franchise stores or for echopark are combined, it's just an incredibly exciting time in sonic automotive. we're going to grow the franchise side of the business and allocate capital accordingly. we're going to continue to press on the accelerator for echopark. we look at these next few quarters as an opportunity to look at a few other things. we're practicing -- we're testing a five year-old model now in a couple of stores, expanding the mileage range, maybe up to 55,000 to help mitigate the next couple of quarters. but overall, we're just not going to change our strategy. when you see where we were before all of this hit, our ebitda was growing nicely, and we expect that to continue to come back just as soon as we have a gap between the wholesale and retail pricing. so new cars days' supply are going to be tough, certainly through the fourth quarter and in first quarter. but there would be some trickle up in terms of days' supply as we move into the second quarter, in the third quarter of next year. and hopefully, we get back to that 20, 25 days' supply range, which is historically low, but that gets the job done in terms of creating the gap of wholesale to retail for us.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
yes. this is david smith. you have to remember that we're -- as far as echopark, as we're growing market share and growing our footprint. and so this is an investment in that. and so when the market reverts back to what the normal traditional market, you got to remember, some of our echopark stores prior to this unusual situation we have right now in the wholesale market where some of our most profitable stores in our entire company. so you'll see it pop back up here shortly as the market corrects.
john joseph murphy -- bofa securities -- analyst
and sorry, just one follow-up. i mean, jeff, why not drop to a five to six year-old vehicle, that's a high-quality vehicle that you can represent well and kind of be consistent with your mo of what you're trying to offer the consumer there to kind of alleviate some of the pressure on inventory or supply in echopark?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes. we're looking at, in particular, five year-old, it adds complexities, john, in terms of reconditioning and the amount of time. remember, echopark is all about buy car, transport the car, recon the car, merchandise the car and moving like 12 days to getting on the frontline, it's gone. so that 20-day frontline supply and that 10-day pipeline supply is critical to us keeping our expenses where they need to be. you got to have a little bit of a different technician, a little bit of a different recon process, but we sell one to eight in the san antonio market. and the volume really hasn't adjusted there, and our margins are positive. so there are some things that we're going to pile around here with over the next quarter or so. and it might be that when we come out of this, echopark model is a 1- to five year-old model under 60,000 miles, we're working on that, and we'll see how that goes. we just -- we're not going to disrupt our entire model for this sort of black swan event, if you will, that's happened in my 25 years is really at this meant the time has never happened. and it just makes no sense that we know the new prime inventory coming back. it's not going to come back pre-pandemic levels. i think we all know that and want that because we're ensuring the high margins on the new car side. but it's going to come back. it's not going to stay 8- to 10-day supply, we're not going to have 2,000 cars on ground in our franchise stores. we'll get back to 13,000, 14,000 cars and things will return to normal. and that happens that gap comes back, watch the ebitda at echopark, it will skyrocket given the number of stores that we now have open and the amount of coverage that we'll have by the end of the year and next year.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
and one more thing i think it's unappreciated or underappreciated that the perceived headwind to the franchise business as new and used margins revert toward a normalized wherever the new normal go-forward level and it's -- that that's an absolute tailwind to launch echopark back on its previous trajectory, both from a profitability perspective and incremental volume perspective because of those fast turns that load a supply, we've really gained a tremendous pricing advantage once the wholesale price increases moderate and then ultimately decline.
john joseph murphy -- bofa securities -- analyst
very helpful, guys. thank you so much.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from rick nelson of stephens inc. rick, your line is open.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
i'd like to follow up on slide -- slide 20, the adjusted pricing, i'm curious now how your pricing compares to the overall market and the ebitda while shows that have narrowed, can we take the september ebitda loss and carry that forward? or do you think you can continue to narrow the loss from the september levels?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
so this is jeff. we're going to continue to narrow the loss. we were -- traditionally, echopark's price in the 94.5% to 95% of market range. we're probably in the 98% to 98.5% range today. and we'll continue to narrow that. that's not -- it's not just the price that's going to narrow that, it's also some of the other moves that we're making, buying more cars off the street, expanding to that five year model. a couple of those things will also generate higher margins. and of course, in the long run, we believe that the echopark front-end margin will end up naturally being in the positive. it won't be always negative $300 or $400. but as the brand takes a hold across the country as we expand the brand across the country. that's why dino and tim and the whole entire team are here. we're really looking at elasticity of pricing and how we can continue to have the great revenue growth, the great volume growth and the ebitda growth by doing some of those things. so a combination of -- will continue through the fourth quarter of narrowing the ebitda loss. and then -- and that will probably continue into the first quarter, along with some of the other changes that we're making.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
and i'm not sure if you can answer this, but the challenges in the wholesale market if they continue, does that change the timeline for echopark and the exploration of strategic alternatives or executing on that?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
no timelines have changed. we're still executing on our plan. we're still executing on our strategic alternatives, as david smith said earlier. and other than that, there's no further comments, there just no timelines have changed at all. the only thing that i would tell you is that we're sort of going to have a convergence on ebitda in the year 2022. that's what we said. and given what's going on in the wholesale market, that probably pushes back to the end of the year now versus being the entire year.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
and rick, this is david. i think, again, you have to look at this short period of time in this unusual market. it's just -- again, an investment in the brand at echopark and growing our footprint and then we're just plowing through this and then we're going to come out the other side of it. and as jeff and the group have been saying with a group of stores that are going to be highly profitable in the future.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
just for that also, like if you give more color on the rfj acquisition, the multiple you paid the quality of the stores, the management that's coming along or might not be coming along? any commentary there would be helpful.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
so we visited all of the rfj stores, tim keen myself, david, the whole team, we've been in the last couple of weeks living on the road, we visited all the stores. the entire management team is coming along for the ride. their general managers, the regional vice presidents who also our solutions they work for us at one point in time, myron heronema, who's their coo, also, who is is staying. and of course, rick ford, their leader is staying. so we were recently out on the west coast at their general annual meeting with their general management controllers. we're so excited about this. we kind of walk into one of their stores, and it feels like a sonic store, they run their playbooks, very similar to us. and it's because their dna comes from sonic automotive. they are a fantastic leadership team. and we just -- we're very excited. we always want more talent on our team. and that's strictly important to us and adding that talent to this team is just going to be great. this is a perfect fit for us. given the multiple somewhere in the mid-5s. so we think that, that's a really good deal for us. and then there are synergies that we have kind of day one synergies in the $12 million to $14 million range and then long-term synergies in the $20 million to $30 million range when you put the companies together. so it's just a really, really exciting time. we looked at a lot of other big deals that were done, and this one was just the best fit for us.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
yes. this is david smith. i just would add that we've already learned that some of the processes that the rfj team uses that what's very exciting is, is the opportunity to implement some of their processes into our stores nationwide, they could be a huge boost to our profitability in the future, which we haven't even figured in as part of the synergy.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
and particularly, the small-town usa stores, they just do a fantastic job in the smaller towns and we look forward to expanding that to some of our smaller town stores, although, we own a lot. but it certainly opens up allies for us to add more revenue in those type of markets.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
great. also, gpu was a big driver on the franchise side. if you could speak to the gpu exit, right, does the inventory came down, that in fact the gpu increase and the exit rate that as we put in the 4q and the recovery of the several some parts, do you think that, that is sustainable?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
first of all, on the service and parts question, yes, it's a huge tailwind for us. our warranty was only off 9%, i think, for the quarter. our customer pay was up 21%. california lags, all of that, we're going to get a big tailwind for california as they begin to open up as well. so the parts and service business is fantastic for us and continues to be great. we don't -- we see that as a big tailwind to us as we move into next year and the year after. in terms of new car gpus, they just keep getting stronger. i don't know where the ceiling is. october's numbers are exceptional, better than what you're seeing in the -- what you saw on the third quarter for us. and i just -- one of the things that i think is going to happen is that manufacturers have gotten really wise to this. they're not going to bring inventory levels back to the levels they were before. we're going to have sustainable new car pur growth into the future. and i just don't see it -- it's never going to go back to pre-covid. i don't want to say never, but it's very unlikely that it's going to go back to pre-covid levels. we're going to enjoy great our new car front-end margins for the foreseeable future.
heath r. byrd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. on the fixed side, it's really amazing. you mentioned the fixed ops. even if you compare to 2019, we're still up 20%. so fixed ops and the customer pay is really coming back strong.
nels richard nelson -- stephens inc -- analyst
that's great. thanks for that. thanks guys for the color. good luck.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
you bet. thank you.
operator
our next question today comes from rajat gupta of jpmorgan. your line is open, please proceed.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i just had a follow-up on the used vehicle franchise side. i'm not sure if i missed your comment earlier, but 11% below 3q '19 levels. just curious -- i mean you saw a much stronger results at peers. so just curious as to the disconnect there? anything specific to the company that might be driving that, maybe sourcing or regional mix? just the first comment on that would be helpful.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes, i think it's more brand mix. i think if you look at us and steve, they've got a real high-line brand mix and both of us were a little bit flat to the prior year versus some of the others. and that -- a lot of that is just leased. there's not a lot of off-lease cars coming back in our high-line stores. and so the sourcing of that inventory is difficult. and we're trying to balance the volume and the excellent margin growth that we saw in the quarter. we're very comfortable that we can sustain the margin levels that we're at. i'm not so sure that the industry can sustain the used car levels, margin levels that they're at along with a good balance in growth and volume. as the inventories come back in the high-line stores, in particular from off-lease, which is a big source of preowned and certified pre-owned inventory for us, that will make a big difference in terms of our growth. so that's what drove that.
danny wieland -- vice president of investor relations,
and adding to that, this is danny. i think that one of the things that if you look at where margins are you look at gpus, where we are today and where we expect to be longer term and the mix and the sustainability of earnings based on those, we have a lot of things that are headwinds based on the brand mix, lower lease rate, lower lease returns, frame mix. and so i think that our selling specific earnings opportunity to sustain at these levels with the expense reductions being put in place looks pretty good, i think, is in '22 and not just that, but beyond in '23 as we return to a more normalized environment.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and just on f&i, really good improvement here over the last few years, particularly after the jm&a partnership. it was as to if you can unpack some of the drivers' quarter-to-quarter on the f&i uptake? and just how we should be thinking about the go-forward opportunity there?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes. so it continues to go, right. our warranty penetration on the franchise side is what -- is a big driver of that improvement. and i give a lot of that credit to our team, internally richard o'connor, tim keen, and that whole team is really focused on driving f&i for us. and i also give a lot of credit to jm&a. they've done a fantastic job, a great business partner. and as you stated over the last three or four years, they've just done a -- they've done an outstanding job with us. very stable workforce in terms of our f&i leaders. we just very, very little turnover. the company turnover is just exceptional, right? our general management turnover i think will be less than 3% this year. and so we're in really, really good shape from an f&i perspective. and i expect that our f&i numbers will just continue to improve. we're seeing that in october. i don't know what the ceiling is. there's one, i think, or two of the other publics are out ahead of us, and we'll go chase that down as well. but i really see nothing but upside from an f&i perspective moving forward.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
understood. this is lastly on the online platform coming up later this year, in early next year. any preview on that platform? we've obviously had a lot of your peers come out with their platforms. how do you plan to differentiate what are going to be like key features? any quick preview on that would be helpful.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
yes, sure. so we actually compare ourselves versus the best-in-class competition out there. we looked at 10 different components in the consumer journey that were really meaningful to the consumer. and we believe we deliver significant advantage versus the other guys, whether it's a real contract that the consumer can sign online, any perfect payments, shopping a lender network of our preferred lenders, giving the consumer the ability to sign the real documents online, not documents that he'll have to sign again when they come in store. and then also the omnichannel shopping ability. so the ability to stop halfway online and finish in store we know most consumers want to do that. they want to go test drive the car before they finalize the deal. our new platform enables that. so you can contain your progress, and then you can really do it in a seamless way, pick it up in a seamless way when you go to the dealership. it had a great customer experience, and a customer experience that we believe will reduce the time in store so the customer will be more satisfied and also make our sales process more efficient. our sales folks will be able to sell more cars because they're not spending three or four hours in executing the deal. so we've taken our time here. we've learned from others, and we believe we're going to be the best and we leverage that to accelerate our business.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes. i think you'll remember, we really slowed down because we just did not have the expertise until steve and his team showed up. so last year, we said, we're going to slow down. everybody else launched -- and part of our process was to go on everybody's site and back hours. i don't care if it was carmax or carbonear or autonation or whoever, we went and bought parts from everybody to see where -- how everything works. and we felt like we could build a better tool for the consumer and the experience, and we've done that. and so we'll have a day where we share that tool with the investment community and really get you guys into the tool once you use it, it's self-intuitive, i mean just it's very simple to work. and i think we're looking forward to getting the launch. i think we're going to launch our charlotte store in the north carolina market in december. and then in january and february, we'll launch the rest of the platform.
steve wittman -- chief digital retail officer
yes. the only other point to make is this will be entirely automated. so we will have people in the background doing the deal. it's automated based on the different api calls as the consumer goes to the journey. like i said before, we're using artificial intelligence to help with that. we're also using robotics process automation to create the right documents and to create those deals. so no human involvement. of course, if the consumer wants human involved in, we'll let them. but our system is really an automated system that lets the consumer seamlessly buy a car and this is might be three steps, three simple steps.
rajat gupta -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
got it. great. thanks for all the color and good luck.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from ethan huntley of jefferies. ethan, please go ahead.
ethan david huntley -- jefferies llc -- analyst
this is ethan on for bret jordan. just back to new inventory. i was wondering, if you could sort of provide some color on how that trended throughout the quarter? i know you mentioned it was sort of 10 days at quarter end, and you expect a gradual improvement. but just during the quarter, has it sort of decreased since the start, maybe bounce along the bottom, improved. just sort of any color you could provide there would be helpful.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes, if you go back to -- if you kind of go back to march of this year, we had about a 43-day supply of new inventory. by the end of june, that order down to 14. july was 12, august was 12, september 10. and i think we've sort of bottomed out here and you're plateauing now, and we start trickling back up, and that's going to be different by manufacturer just depending on how they're executing in their availability to parts, chips, you name it. like covid really did the second wave of covid really is it's not as much a chip issue. i think it is a labor issue. we see it on the parts side and getting parts deliveries across the board. so i think we're in our -- we're not going to get any lower than the 8, 9, 10 days supply, and that starts moving back north as we move forward from here, but it's going to be slow. so q1 and q2 are going to be a challenge. and q4, q1 and q2 are going to be a challenge from an inventory perspective.
ethan david huntley -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then we sort of talked about new gpus, but maybe moving to used gpus, pretty strong during the quarter, up about 32% on a same-store basis. but any sort of color you could provide on sort of the cadence of those used gpus month-to-month?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
month-to-month dan, do you want to answer anything on that?
danny wieland -- vice president of investor relations,
yes, so to me it's just north of 1,800 for the quarter. and we had a little bit of variability in that as we went through the quarter. if you recall, at the end of july, when we were looking at what we expected and what the wholesale price environment was doing, it started to soften that allowed retail to catch up a bit. and so there was a little bit of a dip there in our business with our maybe margin mix in the middle part of the quarter. but as we've seen these pricing continue to expand exiting the third quarter through the month of october to date, we continue to see strength in those used margins.
ethan david huntley -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. great. and then just lastly here, if you don't mind, sort of on the m&a front, are you seeing multiples getting pretty frothy, given the record profitability? are you seeing sort of deals being priced on more of a -- sort of a normalized profitability?
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
as i'm looking at all the deals that we're looking at, it's pretty normalized in terms of the times earnings that we're looking at paying, and what i've seen a few of the other deals, i don't think anybody's deals that have been recently announced have been way out of whack. so i think it's pretty normalized. i think that there's a lot of dealers out there that are looking at the tax situation and saying, what we want to -- we want to exit or they're looking long term and what the investment is going to have to be from an electric vehicle perspective, and they don't want to go through the journey. and so the combination of those two things, i think, are keeping the multiples reasonable. and we certainly felt that way with the deals that we've done. and as i look at the rest of the deals are being done; i don't see anything just way out of whack.
david bruton smith -- chief executive officer and director
this is david smith. i also think that you got to remember the automotive market is so huge. the consolidation that's left to be done in the market is just -- it's just begun. so there are so many opportunities where there are some dealers that would want a huge multiple. but we've had plenty of various opportunities. i think that it's really important to emphasize that our team is -- we're very roi-focused and we passed on many different opportunities that led up to the big announcement of the rfj deal and just it works from an roi perspective, but also, as jeff mentioned, from a cultural perspective in the team and most -- the great team at rfj and just all work together. so it's a -- we just want to emphasize that, that we've got the focus and discipline on this team to make great acquisitions. so moving forward, i wouldn't expect to see us paying some ridiculous multiple.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
yes. and because we have that selective disciplined, we've been out talking to a lot of different dealers and there's more deals in the pipeline, which is one -- it's one. this is just a great on time for our company because we have the balance sheet. we're in a position to go do this. and we've worked very hard on doing that really since 2017, 2018, when this leadership team came together, that really made a big, big difference in the company. our balance sheet got short up. and like we said earlier, we did fight these two battles and there are plenty of deals out there to be made, and we're going to get our fair share.
ethan david huntley -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great, i appreciate the color.
frank jeff dyke -- president and director
you bet. thank you.
