thank you, sir. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jeff garro of william blair andÂ company. your line is open.
jeff garro -- william blair & company -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. i want to ask a couple of questions about the fourth-quarter guidance, and i guess maybe more specifically about new customer launches and performance-based fees. so first on performance-based fees, you've talked about a majority of those performance-based fees accruing in your fourth fiscal quarter historically.
with the visibility you have now on fiscal 2021 performance, how is the seasonality of performance-based fees played out during the year?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, jeff, this is steve. thanks for the question. you're right. the cost savings-based performance guarantees, we almost, in every case, defer and recognize those in the fourth quarter as we track and see the healthcare spend finalized in december, and then we do that ultimate tally in january and february.
and so this year would be similar to those prior years where we've deferred and would recognize those in the fourth quarter. some customers, we picked that up along the way, but that is generally the case. it's why when you look at our p&l, you see somewhere in the range of a third to about 35% of a year's worth of revenues occur in the fourth quarter because we're picking up those cost-based revenues there. and i would say that that shape looks similar this year as it has in prior years.
jeff garro -- william blair & company -- analyst
and i know claims need to be reconciled for some time after we pass the end of the calendar year, but any visibility or degree of confidence that in achieving a similar level of performance-based fees compared to your annual contract value, or acv, versus what you've done historically?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
right. so it's certainly an incredibly unusual year in terms of the pandemic and spend. what we're seeing now, remember, the way that our contracts work is we generally -- we earn that revenue when we beat the index, or we beat the market. and even in this environment in which healthcare spend decrease quite a bit immediately after the pandemic, and now, it's rising back up as people come back into the healthcare system, our data is showing that we are continuing to save against those indices.
with all of that said, jeff, we are maintaining some conservatism even within the guide that we're providing today because it is such an unusual year in the end-of-year guidance that we provided.
jeff garro -- william blair & company -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. one more for me. back to the end-of-the -- fourth-quarter guidance and the impact of new customers launching on january 1, i know there's some diversification there, but -- and you referenced this in the prepared remarks, many customers starting on january 1.
and you talked about strong customer account growth throughout the year and look forward to an update in a few months when you close out the fiscal year and where you end there. but in the interim, could you discuss the mix of signed customers that were live as of the end of this november fiscal quarter versus those that went live as of january 1?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. i can give you some color on that. one of the reasons we're so pleased with being able to provide an increase in guidance today in the midst of a pandemic is the underlying core strength of the business that we're seeing. and raj mentioned in his remarks, we're seeing strong growth in terms of new bookings across market segments, meaning size of customer and offerings.
and we've had a strong bookings year. so many of those either went live in terms of open enrollment services in november time frame or launched on january 1. and some of that uplift in our guidance relates to a strong new booking season of customers that launched on 1/1.
jeff garro -- william blair & company -- analyst
that helps. thanks for taking the questions, guys.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert jones of goldman sachs. your line is open.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. i guess maybe -- i know we'll have to wait until next quarter to get the acv number and guidance. but maybe just wanted to try to get some preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about revenue growth shaping up for next year. and maybe just to frame it a little, i mean, some of the major announcements that you've shared so far with johnson controls, which you mentioned, humana, university system of georgia, just making some rough assumptions around normal course of economics on members, employees, it seems like you can get a lot of the way there, if not beyond your kind of long-term 25% revenue growth target.
so just wanted to kind of level set ahead of the specific numbers next quarter. is there anything specific around the wins this year that would be different than historical wins? or is it right to think that some of the wins you guys have already announced that are in the book, if you will, can really kind of set you up well against your long-term targets for next year?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, bob, this is steve. i'll start. and a couple of things on that. the wins from this year are very much a part of what gives us confidence in raising the guidance and the view that we're providing today for this year.
we will provide guidance for fiscal '22 in next quarter. but that all said, we're really bullish on the business and the long-term growth rate that we've spoken about, that 25%-plus kind of growth rate that we think is achievable. we do temper that a bit given the covid environment that we're in, the fact that there are unemployment issues that given our per member per month revenue model, does give us pause, it puts us in a place where we want to have some conservatism in the way we think about the numbers, while we're incredibly bullish about the core underlying business. and those bookings this year that we've spoken about, i think, are in line very much so with the kinds of bookings we've done before from a pricing standpoint.
we're seeing it again across offerings, oftentimes, with bolt-ons in our trusted supplier program or covid response care capability and so forth.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yes. bob, this is raj. i'll just chime in to steve's point. the bottom line is that throughout the course of the year, we've been very consistent around the fact that every market segment and all of our core products have seen traction.
and we -- and therefore, we've been able to raise guidance throughout the course of the year. so we continue to see a strong demand environment. we'll obviously update guidance as it relates to next year, coming up next quarter. but the outlook and the makeup of the types of customers signing on has been positive all year.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. no, no, that's encouraging. and i guess just maybe one follow-up. you guys -- you mentioned the raise from the proceeds from the follow-on offering to strengthen the balance sheet.
balance sheet was in pretty good shape, to begin with. anything you would want to highlight as far as just priorities in use of proceeds, use of cash as we think about where the balance sheet sits today post that raise?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
if i take a quick swing at that one -- and then you add on anything i missed. i think bottom line is we think we sit in a marketplace with enormous growth opportunities with a huge target addressable market and in a leadership position where we're acquiring customers across segments and across products at a rapid clip. and so strengthening the balance sheet was entirely about investment, investing in the business clearly in terms of continuing to fund that growth. and beyond that, to strategically identify opportunities where we can expand our product portfolio and/or expand the types of value propositions we can deliver to our existing customers and the new customers.
we're consistent against both of those objectives. outside of that, not much more to give you, obviously, before we announced new products or new offerings or potential new capabilities, but that's where our focus is.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. i appreciate it. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ricky goldwasser of morgan stanley. your question, please.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. hi. good afternoon. my question is focused on the partnership with ginger.
can you maybe give us some updates there and the uptake that you're seeing with both existing customers in the new win?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
sure. let me let shantanu speak to the relationship and the sort of the -- how it's working. i will tell you we acquired our first customer where we think the pipeline is very strong there and we see significant demand. shantanu, you want to jump in and talk a little bit about how the relationship is going?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yes, absolutely. thanks, ricky, for the question. i think, first of all, from a demand perspective, as a physician, acutely aware of how much mental health is really a crisis around the country. and i think that's being reflected in the interest that we're seeing.
and i think there's also a broader recognition from the market that with a lot of different point solutions out there, that i think there's a lot of interest for solutions that can drive outcomes and ultimately lead to cost savings. and so i think all of those are creating significant tailwinds around the partnership with ginger, which the whole idea was to create a solution that integrated physical and mental health with an eye toward outcomes, which we thought was pretty differentiating from how the rest of the market in mental health has pursued. and so with that, the two teams have gotten into a really great cadence starting to learn a lot from that first customer that raj mentioned. and a lot of great early indications that we're having the impact that we wanted to see at the outset.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so as we think about the relationship and the uptake of customers, this sort of kind of an add-on offering that we could see adding upside middle year, i.e., not necessarily customers bringing on as they launch a program, that's something that they would add on as the year progresses?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
certainly, ricky, we would expect that offerings like this one, like we saw with covid response care this year, accolade covid response care this year are products or offerings that are capable of launching midyear, while some of our core offerings are capable of launching midyear, as has been noted previously, many of them launched predominantly on 1/1, coincident with the plan year. so i think the short answer to your question is, yes, it's very feasible, and it will be largely dependent upon the culture of deployment of rollouts of that customers who are purchasing.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then when we think about the delta between the revenue guide raise and the ebitda guide, it seems that there's less of flow through. can you maybe talk a little bit about the investments that you are doing and how should we think about these investments as we kind of like also update our models for next year, understanding that it's too early for guidance yet?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. ricky, this is steve. thanks for the question. a couple of things.
as we raised guidance in terms of revenue and seeing a very core -- strong core underlying business, it's really important to us to maintain that profitability target but not in a rush to outperform per se on the bottom line given all the opportunities we see to invest in growth. for example, investing in distribution around sales and marketing, not just adding quota-carrying reps, so to speak, but also building strong relationships in channels with brokers and consultants and others in those channels. the way we work with humana, for example, investing behind those opportunities to drive smart growth with attractive unit economics is how we think about it. so when you step back, i would harken back to guidance we've spoken about in the past, which is this idea of a demonstrable step toward breakeven as we drive attractive growth.
so that idea of roughly two years out to breakeven or roughly breakeven profile is still how we think about the business. so big market opportunity, creating value by pursuing it with attractive unit economics to get to responsible breakeven type of profile the next couple of years.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael cherny of bank of america. your line is open.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the questions. pulling a little bit more on that thread relative to the ebitda side, tying back to a couple of other questions that you addressed earlier. as you think about that future growth, and you talked about the mid-20s, give or take, long-term growth targets that you've had, would there be any desire -- i guess how would you contemplate, especially with some of the new products, the potential to essentially spend to accelerate that growth? or is it more a fact of why to stay measured rollout products as is and not get too ahead of your skis in terms of new customer momentum? just trying to think about the puts and pulls on that long-term trend and how you think about manage those cost investments along those lines.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
steve, can i hit that from -- first of all, hi, michael. it's nice to say hi again. steve, let me take that from a philosophical point and then kick it to you to add any color.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
ok.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
from my perspective, michael, the way what we think about it, we've tried to be very disciplined consistently in terms of the way we talk about our business and the way we run our business that we see a 25% growth rate as far as the eye can see. and that we're going to run the business in a disciplined fashion, trending toward that breakeven point out in fiscal '23, with the acknowledgment as well that to the degree we see growth opportunities that are more material than that 25%, that in a huge target addressable market with a leadership position, that we'll evaluate those opportunities and potentially -- and bias toward spending against those opportunities. and so to the degree we're outperforming, you're going to see us spend into that outperformance to continue that growth trajectory and continue to distance ourselves from the competition as it relates to both innovation and customer acquisition. and i think the reverse is also true.
you'll see us disciplined from a top-line and growth perspective, and you'll see us disciplined from a bottom-line perspective to the degree that growth doesn't materialize. steve, let me give it to you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, mike. the only thing i'd add to that is as you see us, for example, in this quarter, outperforming on the top line and pursuing those opportunities, as raj just spoke of, a discipline toward maintaining those bottom-line targets as a step toward breakeven. so we have a very, i think, healthy tension as we run the business, mike, between pursuing growth, pursuing growth at attractive unit economics levels while we maintain that discipline to roughly breakeven.
when you dig into the metrics behind our business, when we're with longest-term contracts, three-year type of multiyear contracts on a pmpm basis that are very predictable, you can make a strong argument to invest even more in growth where we are today, investing in 20-or-so percentage of revenue in sales and marketing. but we're doing so with a real eye toward maintaining that step toward running a disciplined business toward breakeven, balanced with the growth opportunity in front of us.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's very helpful. and i guess one follow-up, raj, you kind of gave me the opening for. you had obviously a nice, i just want to use momentum in terms of the number of new customers added. can you give us any sense of the push and pull you had in some of the discussions during the selling season? we hear so much from companies about basically everything is covid, covid, covid, and figuring out how to return to work and all these other dynamics.
well, you actually can help with that on that front and have a ready-made solution. so i guess as you sat through, whether that specifically or just pitching the total wares of accolade, how do those discussions start to shape out? and how were some of the proof points really able to shine through to allow you to drive the customer additions that you have?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, mike. i think if you think about us to rewind -- or excuse me, zoom out to the highest level, what accolade provides is extraordinary relationships with members who are seeking healthcare but confused by the healthcare system. we build trust with those members. that trust yields more interactions, therefore, high engagement.
because we do a good job of getting them to the right place, we lower cost. if you zoom out to that, there's no -- there's been no more profound set of needs as it relates to healthcare questions and decision-making that has occurred in the last 12 months with covid and now rolling into the vaccine. so first testing than the vaccine and then, of course, the mental health challenges that has been exacerbated in the country. and so everything, that prospects i've been talking about in many respects, mike, have been things that they needed to be able to get data to their employees, start with education, move toward guidance and then yield better results.
and so in a shorter way of saying things, our entire business is built on building relationships and leveraging those relationships to drive good guidance toward better clinical outcomes and lower cost. and this year, that need has been more profound than ever. and thus, we've been able to sit in a lot more boardrooms than maybe other vendors who might be more condition-focused.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jailendra singh of credit suisse. your line is open.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. just one follow-up on the question earlier about implied q4 guidance. is it fair to say that around two-thirds of that revenue is fixed? and the $3 million range you have on the guidance, is that all a function of savings-based revenue and operational performance revenue? because i'm assuming that the fixed portion is pretty much locked in at this point with most of your contracts gone effective 1/1.
i'm just as curious if you can give some -- a little bit more color around where is the variability there. and when you say that you're building some cushion there for fiscal q4, is it more on the savings side or some of the variable we should be aware of?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
jailendra, it's steve. thanks for the question. yes, you're in the right ballpark in the fourth quarter that you can think of that as somewhere in the range of a third being variable-based revenue. the reason -- when you think about what's in there when we think of fixed revenues, we think of it as pmpm revenues, members times the pmpm rate, there's always some uncertainty around how many employees are going to be on the roles, so to speak, when we're in the midst of a situation like we are right now.
so you maintain some conservatism on those so that we don't get ahead of ourselves given that employers are still managing their businesses through the pandemic. and then with respect to pgs, similar type of approach, where we want to have some conservatism around it given the unusual environment that we're in. and so you're seeing that in the guide that we're providing today. all of that to say a lot of that uplift relates to the new customers we've booked and the growth that we're seeing and the confidence that we have in the business.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then last quarter, you talked about results benefiting from the slower hiring ramp. i was just curious that if you still continue to remain conservative on hiring, even when the demand environment looks ok for you guys, just curious, like how you're thinking about that.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. so you'll see this year -- this quarter, i should say, the third-quarter opex as a percentage of revenues grew a bit on a sequential basis. that's the impact of us letting out the reins a bit as we came out of the initial part of the covid pandemic back in march, april, may, and the confidence that we saw as we booked more customers, prepared for customer launches in the fourth quarter and are seeing the demand environment remains strong. so it's always about maintaining that balance of hitting those bottom-line targets and reinvesting oftentimes back into that growth as we overperform on the top.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and the last question, raj. i was wondering if you can spend some time on the competitive landscape. we have come across several digital health companies, which historically focused on some point solutions or some set of services and now looking to explore the employee navigation, employee engagement services for employers.
i know it is still an underpenetrated market, but do you think covid has resulted in increased competition in this space and more interest from other players where you come across during rfps? any thoughts on that?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
raj, you may be on mute.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
i was on mute. i just gave a great answer, jailendra, but i'll hit it again. first, it's great to talk to you. thanks for the question.
when you think about the competitive landscape in advocacy, navigation, benefits, and health management, i think the space has been fairly competitive for a long time with digital-only providers who have attended to solve the problem fundamentally by providing digital tools to consumers to be able to manage their healthcare decision-making. that's proven to be ineffective for a number of years for a variety of reasons that we've outlined in previous conversations. you've also seen companies really focused on either conditions or very specific populations, high-cost claimants, or those who are dealing with acute conditions. i think you'll continue to see activity in those spaces.
those categories might choose to potentially position themselves more in navigation or advocacy largely because that category -- this category, navigation, and advocacy, is growing really quickly, and therefore, it might be advantageous to position themselves there. but we haven't seen a material change in companies entering this space with the variety of tools needed to be able to deliver value to customers. for us, that -- as you know, i mean, from my care team that you build trusted relationships, clinical teams that can guide people through conical programs that are evidence-based and sees better clinical results, all of which drive cost savings that you're willing to sign up to right down to the dollar. so has the competitive landscape changed in that regard? no.
have we seen more companies doing the same thing, but announcing that they're engagement companies or they're navigation companies? absolutely.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sean wieland of piper sandler. your line is open.
sean wieland -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks very much. so my question is on the recent price transparency rule for providers. and i wanted to get your sense of how you see this longer-term impacting your value proposition in the care navigation space.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
shantanu, do you want to grab that one?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yes, absolutely. it's a great question. as you know, one of the most common points in someone's care journey that we help them with is finding a provider. and we've made a lot of investment in being able to personalize that decision and help match people to the best provider for them.
i think for us, the new transparency rules is actually really exciting. so i think what that allows us to do is have even more granular data that we can use in concert with other data. i mean, we know as a patient, prices is important. it's a critical input into a decision, but so is the quality provider, so is the appropriateness of the care of the provider, so is the safety and quality of the facility that they're in.
and so we look at it as really additive to what we're able to provide, which is we're able to combine multiple data points together, including price transparency data, and deliver that in a way that consumers can understand and actually help them make that right decision for them and ultimately get to better health outcomes. so we're very bullish on the new regulation.
sean wieland -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's great. thank you. and then i just wanted to check in again on the airlines. they announced that they were bringing back some of their furloughed employees.
did that have any impact on your guidance?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, sean, this is steve. i would say a little bit but not a lot. certainly, the majority of what you're seeing in the guide is the underlying business launches on 1/1 and so forth. the airlines, we maintain conservatism around in the fourth quarter primarily because it's not clear exactly when and how many of those employees come back and just the overhang that the airlines are obviously still punching through a low travel environment.
so we're maintaining some real rational conservatism there.
sean wieland -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. and, steve, you said that you're managing cash collections for the airlines to be flat for the fiscal year. is there any kind of catch-up payment that is planned for next fiscal year?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
we don't comment specifically on customer contracts, sean, but i would say that that was primarily meant to address the acute situation of the pandemic and to keep the changes in the contract, tried to keep that inside the fiscal year. so otherwise, those relationships continue to be strong, and those contracts are the way that they're originally structured.
sean wieland -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matthew gillmor of baird. your line is open.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question. maybe going back to the aon study. i was curious if that was specific to total health and benefits, sort of some of the other products. and then more broadly, is this a segment of the market, the smaller employers? are they more sensitive to studies like this? or is it a similar dynamic to the prior study for large employers in terms of the importance from this?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
shantanu, you want to grab that one?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yes, absolutely. it's a great question. and we love talking about that study. i think on the first, yes, this is a total health and benefit customer.
and that's really a function of the fact that we wanted to do the most rigorous study design possible. and so what that meant is we wanted to have a baseline year. we wanted to go look at customers at one year and look at them in two years. and so just in terms of where the business was two years ago, the preponderance of our customers were in total health and benefits.
in terms of your second point, i think it actually ties to the earlier question about competitiveness, too. i think where we are today with different navigation services out there, i think the market's matured to the point where, ultimately, what they care about is cost and outcomes. and that's extremely difficult to achieve in healthcare, as you know. and so for us, i think the aon study is a significant competitive differentiator, right, because it allows us to say that independently through a very rigorous study design, we're able to demonstrate significant and sustained cost savings.
we think that's difficult to replicate, frankly. and it's important to all sizes of customers because ultimately, one of the greatest challenges that small customers, large customers all facing is the significant cost. and as we're looking at the next year and seeing predictions of potentially another double-digit year in terms of cost trend, we think that's going to be a critical importance to all sorts of customers.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
ok, great. and then i guess i wanted to ask about the tricare contract. i know in the past, you said that implementation has gone really well. i was hoping you could remind us about the process that they'll go through to determine when to potentially expand the number of lives you're supporting.
does that take place in calendar 2021, or is that further out?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
i think the best way to think about that -- this is raj again. the best way to think about that is we need a measurable period upon which we can demonstrate value associated with the agreed-upon measurables for the contract. those agreed upon measurables for the contract, just to take one step back, look fairly similar to the types of performance guarantees and incentives that we've educated the market out as it relates to our consumer customers -- or excuse me, our commercial customers. that deployment really went live in the early part of this year in may -- excuse me, the early part of last year, calendar 2020.
we would expect that we need at least a year, potentially a little longer, to be able to show the effects of all of the capabilities that we deliver to those consumers. and then claims run out against that year or potentially longer. so we don't have an exact time frame where the government will make that decision. we would expect it would be in late 2021 calendar or early calendar 2022.
we continue to give you more color commentary on where we are. we continue to expand to the growth side of the population in terms of members engaged. and we continue to see really strong results as it relates to engagement levels within those populations, as well as satisfaction levels.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hannah baade of d.a. davidson. your question, please.
hannah baade -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. i first wanted to ask a bit of a follow-up on the price transparency rule. obviously, the rule itself will not change the impact of high prices and overall spend levels or your overall consumer demand. but do you have any concerns that more consumer-friendly price menus may impact the number of annual encounters you have with your members?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
shantanu, do you want to grab that one?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yes. it's a great question. thanks, hannah. i think for us, the decision around making -- choosing a provider is an incredibly complex and personalized decision, right? i mean, i think all of us have been in that position of trying to find a doctor, and price and cost is certainly a critical input, but we do really look at it as just one input, right? in a lot of care decisions as a consumer, you may want to pay for a higher cost provider if there's a commensurate increase in value that you can get in terms of the quality or the complications that you're going to face.
and that's what we see, and that's what our record has been with serving these numbers is that what's really missing is not necessarily a single self-service tool, but it's the ability to integrate disparate pieces of information and deliver it in a personalized, empathetic way that ultimately is what our consumers are looking for and, ultimately, what drives the greatest value. and so we don't anticipate that this alone is going to decrease the engagement that we see. we think it's going to continue to be able to strengthen what we can deliver to our members.
hannah baade -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
awesome. thanks. and just one follow-up. when thinking about that initial pmpm rate on a customer land, how does that vary when accolade is replacing other solutions versus a greenfield customer? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
the way to think about --
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
sorry. go ahead, steve.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. sorry, raj. hannah, this is steve. so the way to think about that is, generally speaking, if you think about total health and benefits, we're oftentimes replacing member services, provider services, and clinical services that the health plan is providing.
and so there is some potential for savings there. but the way to think about it really, that we think about it with our customers is in terms of the roi that's generated. and you harken back to that aon report and the returns and the savings that we're generating for customers is we think of it in that way, the return on the pmpm fee that they're -- the customer is investing.
hannah baade -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of richard close of canaccord genuity. your line is open.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thank you for the question. maybe a follow-up on mike's questions on client discussions. raj, i was wondering if you could talk a little bit, give us some insight in terms of maybe how discussions with potential customers changed from the beginning of the year to the end of the year? and how -- maybe compared to past years, what they were mainly focused on? and i think you said demand, overall demand is accelerating.
is there any way or any metric you can provide to sort of quantify that?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
first off, thanks for the question, richard. let me start with the beginning, and i'll -- with the early part of the question, which is, how are the conversations evolving over the course of the calendar year and perhaps really even from the years previous to a pandemic here like the one we have this year. by and large, what i would say is, for sure, is by segment, we saw in the middle part of the year as we were hitting the heart of the pandemic in the first wave of the pandemic. customers were very, very preoccupied, understandably, with covid, covid testing, access to care, and an understanding of how to keep their employees safe.
then our immediate response to that was not only accolade covid response care and help people return to work but also a set of clinical programs available to all of our customers to help them manage their employees, employee education, and access to care, etc. beyond that, the conversations have continued to then move into a sense of what population health looks like for 2021. i think post the first wave of the pandemic, the conversations moved into, we believe that costs are potentially depressed in 2020. in 2021 to the degree they return, how can we manage that? again, an area where we think we can play a really significant role for prospects and customers as it relates to engaging in total population health management via risk stratification of clinical programs.
today, it's a little early to tell with the second wave upon us and the vaccine upon us, where the conversations will lead us. we do know that they're growing as the conversations continue and that our relevance continues to be really, really high. last point, i think, richard, as it relates to any metrics we could guide you to. i think we're really focused on growth.
as you see, the core of our segments and across each of the core products. we'll update guidance next quarter for -- in terms of where we are from an acv perspective and our expectations for the next year. beyond that, i think it's more a qualitative view on the continued strength of the business, as evidenced by the top-line growth of the company.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and if i could slip one in for steve. appreciate the comments on the visibility and with respect to performance fee.
and i think we've discussed previously about two-thirds of performance fees are based on operational metrics, maybe the net promoter score, engagement, and customer satisfaction. i would think that you performed very well on those engagements during covid. is there any insight you can provide in terms of how that has trended during the year?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. and thanks for the question, richard. good to talk to you. first of all, you're right that of the variable revenue or performance-based revenue, about two-thirds of them are operational types of performance guarantees, like engagement rates, consumer satisfaction, as measured by nps or csat engagement of families and membership.
those have trended very well during the year. obviously, it took a different shape and way that that happened from the beginning of the year when covid first hit to where it is today. all along, we've been helping members and those have borne out through those kinds of operational pgs. and then as it relates to the other part, the cost savings pgs, those are primarily measured in the fourth quarter contractually in determining the dollar amount that we earn, but we're able to track them as we move through the year.
and i would say we've got good visibility baked into the guidance that we provided as it relates to those pgs.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david grossman of stifel. your line is open.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you. i want to go back to some of your prepared remarks, and maybe i didn't catch this right. but i thought you said that ramping new business could be a temporary drag on gross margin.
and i just wanted to make sure i heard that right. and if i did hear that right, maybe you could perhaps better -- help me better understand that dynamic.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. david, it's steve. when you look at -- one way to think about that is, you're right, in october, november, and going into december and january 1 go-live, we're certainly investing in launching new customers, part of that is staffing up. you'll see historically, our fiscal third quarter, which includes that october, november time frame, gross margins do compress a bit.
that's reflecting the staffing up for those 1/1 launches. and part of what you're hearing from us in the fourth-quarter guide, not only strong top line, but also investment in those new customer launches to ensure that they go really well while we also invest in growth parts of the business for new business around innovation and sales and marketing. that's a bit around the dynamic that we see in third and fourth quarter.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then another question, just about the business model. i'm curious whether you can give us a sense of how much automation the market and the model can tolerate as the business matures? and where we are in that journey, particularly in the large company segment, is there some kind of curve that it follows as you get to know these clients better? or i know it varies by customer size, but are there any other factors we should consider as we think about how many kind of physical interactions you will have versus how many will be automated over time?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
i'll start on that. raj, if you like to chime in. yes, there are a couple of ways we think about that, david. and i would step all the way back to our model at its core, which is we believe very strongly that the engagement of members and getting them to the right health outcome is important to combine that clinical expertise, the empathetic touch, along with the technology and innovation behind it to help it scale.
and we're constantly balancing those and investing in that. as customers mature, for example, we see mobile interactions and self-service interactions increase as customers get to know us better. so there is that efficiency built into customers as they mature with us. but as we introduce more offerings and continue to add on to that relationship, it's kind of a constantly moving target across customers.
but there certainly are those kinds of efficiencies that can happen with customers as we grow with them.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
one last point because i know we're running out of time. just a quick addition to that. as we add interactions with customers and add data about those customers from the various data sources, we're able to better risk stratify those populations. and then, therefore, prioritize and guide them to the right programs and a highly prioritized risk-stratified fashion.
and that might be the -- in addition to the technology levers that steve mentioned, the single biggest drivers of long-term step functions from a margin perspective.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
all right. great. thanks very much.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephanie davis of svb leerink. your line is open.
joy zhang -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi. this is joy zhang on for stephanie. just wondering, just if you can talk about if there were any levels of revenue reserves going to the quarter? and was any of that reversed?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hi, joy. meaning with respect to the third quarter and if the --
joy zhang -- svb leerink -- analyst
yes, third quarter.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
rev beat, i think, is your question. i think beating the guidance that we provided was multi-faceted. some of that was related to stronger membership growth. so you can make a point that we had a level of conservatism that fortunately showed up better even than we had in our model.
so there are elements there where we outperformed in terms of just membership reminder that we have a very diversified customer base across industry. so where we do see some industries under pressure like the airlines, those were well made up for from customers in retail and technology and financial services. so there were certainly some of the beat there. other parts of the outperformance came from new offerings like covid response care that raj spoke about and accolade boost and some trusted supplier upsells in period revenues.
and then finally, just continued strong performance on the pgs and the operational performance guarantees, as we just talked about on a question or two ago.
joy zhang -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. thank you. and as a follow-up, can you provide any color on what the current mix of airline revenues are and what the mix of comcast is?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
so airlines and comcast, was that your point?
joy zhang -- svb leerink -- analyst
yes.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
yes. so you'll see references throughout our 10-q about major customers that those percentages are roughly consistent quarter over quarter. you saw comcast top back up, our largest customer, in line with expectations. but nonetheless, the big trend is that as the business grows, each single customer becomes less a percentage of our total revenue, which is obviously healthy from a diversification standpoint.
so that trend continues, and we expect it to continue into the future.
joy zhang -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. thank you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david larsen of btig. please go ahead. mr.
larsen, your line is open. please make sure you're not on mute.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
sorry about that. congrats on a good quarter. with the revenue growth of 30% this quarter, i mean, it seems to me like 25% growth longer term, that might be a little bit conservative. i mean, i'm just thinking about fiscal 2022, the variables in my mind are people going back to the doctor's offices and claims sort of catching up from the delayed care that had happened over the past year.
and then also the labor markets. can you maybe just talk a little bit about that? do you need to see a significant improvement in the labor markets to meet that sort of 25% growth in revenue bogey? and then with the claims sort of catch-up, assuming that does happen, in your minds, is that a potential tailwind or a headwind or neutral? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, david, it's steve here. so a couple of things. obviously, we're pleased with the 30% growth rate in the third quarter. and i understand your underlying point, we'll come back with future guidance.
importantly, i don't think we're dependent upon very discrete or specific employment factors into that long-term targeted growth rate of 25%. what we're looking at there is very early stages of an extremely large market in which most recently reported just under 100 customers against a market of 20,000-plus opportunities. that's where that growth comes from, that strong demand environment that raj was speaking to. that's what gives us confidence in that kind of 25%-plus growth rate opportunity.
and then with respect to claims catch-up, we view it as more neutral because our contracts are generally structured that our costs need to do better than market. so whether spend environments are lower, like they were this year, or higher, like we all expect them to be next year, the accolade service ought to show up, just like the aon study we talked about earlier will describe, that we do better, materially better than the market because of our model. i think that's the takeaway for us. it gives us the confidence in the strength of the business and the opportunity in front of us.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
ok. one more really quick follow-up. assuming claims costs do come in significantly higher in fiscal '22 relative to fiscal '21, and assuming that you can provide the typical percent cost savings, might that result in higher sort of performance fees in fiscal 4q '22? or is that not how the contracts are structured?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
generally not, david. there is a cap on them. we do that. we think it's smart.
our customers appreciate it. they want to know how to budget for the service. so there isn't this unlimited upside in the contract. our view is continuing to provide that value, really strong roi for customers.
that will result in high returns for the customer and which should show up in retention and new customer acquisition.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
thanks.
operator

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the accolade, inc. fiscal third-quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your host, svp of investor relations, todd friedman.
sir, please go ahead.
todd friedman -- senior vice president of investor relations
thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal third-quarter earnings call. with me on the call today are our chief executive officer, rajeev singh; and our chief financial officer, steve barnes; shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join us for the question-and-answer portion of the call. before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important in evaluating accolade's performance. details on the relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website.
also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements, as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results for accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, todd. hello, everyone. all of us at accolade would like to wish you a happy new year and thank you for joining us to discuss the results of our third quarter for fiscal-year 2021. it's a busy time of year for us with the pandemic and vaccines at the front of our members' minds and a set of new customer go-lives in early stages given the beginning of the new calendar year.
and we're excited to report on our progress. put succinctly, we entered 2021 in a stronger competitive position than any time in accolade's history, and the key metrics bear it out. revenue of $38.4 million and adjusted ebitda loss of $11.4 million were both ahead of our guidance. we raised additional capital via our follow-on offering in october to further strengthen our balance sheet.
the third quarter represents the end of the traditional healthcare selling season, and we saw record adds in terms of new customers and members. we saw continued momentum across all market segments and product offerings. further demonstrating that mainstream customers, the consulting and broker community, carriers, and other partners are embracing our leadership position in this important category. in fact, less than two years ago, at the end of fiscal 2019, accolade had 20 customers.
about 18 months later, at the time of our follow-on offering in october, we had nearly 5 times that number, and our momentum has continued into this quarter. our customers are seeing tangible results and sharing their results with their peers. one customer i'll call out today is ocean state job lot, who reported a 2 times roi in their first year with 90-plus percent high-cost family engagement and 97% customer satisfaction. customers are also speaking about our new solutions.
we hope you take a minute to go to our website, where you can watch the replay of the johnson controls webinar, where they discuss their results with accolade covid response care. for example, they saved more than 17,000 workdays by avoiding unnecessary quarantine. on that topic, we're seeing strong traction with accolade covid response care, where we have continued to sign new customers and have launched a partnership with labcorp pixel to deliver covid test to the home. in a similar vein, initial results from our first mental health-integrated care customer are showing positive trends.
it is early to share the data or make assumptions, but we're very pleased with those early returns and remain enthusiastic about the impact our partnership with ginger can have on our customers and their employees' mental well-being. on the strength of all these factors, we're raising top-line guidance for the 2021 fiscal year by $3 million, which steve will discuss in more detail later in the call. more qualitatively, we see broad macro trends that are shaping the healthcare industry and impacting all companies across the healthcare spectrum. we don't need to explain to you how or why healthcare has become so broken in the united states.
if you're on this call, you already know that because you've chosen to get to know us better and understand how we're trying to change the system. the covid pandemic has been tragic in many ways, and it has exposed some of the worst characteristics of the industry. health care is still too costly. it is still too complex.
and in too many places, it is far too hard for the average person to access quality care or get the information they need to make the right decisions. underlying all that chaos, however, we have seen how good our healthcare system can be. frontline workers, nurses, doctors, lab technicians, custodians, researchers, together, they have all been working tirelessly to find a vaccine to heal the sick and the comfort the grieving. in our darkest moments, we've seen just how powerful the system can be when our industry comes together to solve a problem.
and an accolade, we believe that is the future of healthcare, and it underscores everything we do. we believe that the future of healthcare must be integrated and collaborative and reimagined with the consumer or the member at the center of everything. we're investing in evidence-based clinical programs to help our customers and their members choose the right care and realize the best outcomes. we understand that the best way to bend the cost curve is to embrace those principles and to focus on total population health, because focusing on only the highest cost patients this year, like most of our industry does, doesn't help you identify and prevent the challenges of next year.
and we believe that consumers have never had a greater need for high-touch, empathetic benefit navigation and advocacy services and clinical programs to help them negotiate this increasingly complex marketplace. the pandemic has elevated and accelerated the discussion about the need to fix the healthcare system, and accolade is squarely positioned at the confluence of these macro trends. the distribution of the covid-19 vaccine in the united states is a great example of this need. our incredibly high engagement rate and member satisfaction levels mean we are the go-to source for information in times like these and we have an opportunity to turn tactical interactions into strategic moments.
take the example of a member calling in to find out if vaccines are fully covered by their employer. at accolade, we turn those moments, and yes, most employers are covering the vaccination, into opportunities to answer some of the more strategic questions that members are facing. is it safe? do i have to get it? what are the potential side effects? all the while increasing the possibilities to get that member to the right outcome. the need for our services clearly could not be more significant than it is right now.
it is with that backdrop that i would like to begin to address a question that many of you have asked from the time of our ipo. we were very proud to include the data from an independent study with aon referenced in our ipo prospectus that demonstrated tangible cost savings to accolade's customers. i'm excited to share for the first time that aon not only updated their research, but they expanded the study. they examined a broader list of customers to include those with 1,000 to 30,000 employees.
the results reaffirmed what we saw in the original study, accolade delivers tangible, measurable improvements to companies of all sizes, bending the healthcare cost curve in a material way. the rigor of the aon study creates a strong degree of confidence that these results represent conclusions that are relevant to a broad range of employers in the market. now, for the sake of my marketing team, i have to say that the full report will not be published for a few weeks now and wraps up their work shortly. but i highly encourage you to go to our website and sign up to receive the study when it's released.
we're proud of the customers' results. the 1,200-plus employees at accolade go to work every day with a purpose and passion to serve our customers' employees and their families and their businesses. our model, integrated clinical programs, superior member engagement, measurable value to customers and partners, ability to rapidly iterate on solutions to meet specific needs ultimately delivers better outcomes and lower healthcare costs. the aon study quantifies those benefits and validates the accolade vision.
here are a few of the highlights. all customers in this study saw lower healthcare cost trends relative to their control group in their first year of engaging with accolade and see continued lower trend in the second year. accolade lowers employer costs in many clinical categories, from mental health to diabetes and hypertension to asthma. accolade reduces employer healthcare cost across the member population, including age groups, demographics, geography, and condition levels.
that is a very high-level preview of what you will see in the full report, but i encourage you to read the full report for one simple reason. if you can understand how aon came to their conclusions and you understand the way they validated our value proposition, then you will understand why employers choose accolade. it is why i said at the start of the call that we are better positioned today competitively than at any other time in our history. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to steve to cover financials and other operating highlights.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, raj. i'm pleased to report on our results for our third quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended on november 30, and provide an update to our guidance. we generated $38.4 million in revenue in the third fiscal quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth. this is $1.4 million ahead of the top end of the range of our guidance, which we provided during our last earnings call.
revenue growth was driven primarily by strength in new customer adds and therefore, members, particularly in the enterprise and mid-market segments. adjusted gross margin of 41.8% was roughly flat compared to 41.1% in the prior-year period, reflecting investments we've made in new customer launches, including the defense health agency, which launched in may. adjusted operating expenses improved to 71% of revenues in q3 of fiscal 2021 versus 88% of revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting operating scale efficiencies as we continue on our path toward breakeven. i'll revisit this point about spend during my guidance remarks.
adjusted ebitda loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $11.4 million, which compares favorably to $13.8 million in the prior-year third fiscal quarter and was nearly $600,000 better than the top of our guidance from our last earnings call. the outperformance in adjusted ebitda is primarily attributable to higher adjusted gross profit driven by the revenue overperformance versus guidance. turning to the balance sheet. on the strength of our ipo in july and our follow-on offering in october, cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal q3 totaled $418.9 million with no debt outstanding.
our cash balance reflects $208 million of proceeds from the follow-on offering, net of fees, and offering expenses. next, i'll update you on our accounts receivable balance. ar increased to $15.4 million at the end of fiscal q3, representing about 37 days revenue outstanding, driven in part by an increase associated with our airline customers. you'll recall from our last quarter that we are working with our airline customers to help them manage their cash needs during covid, primarily by changing their payment schedules.
both customers remain on schedule with their payments, and the schedule is designed to keep cash receipts from those customers unchanged within our fiscal year. in addition to the airlines impact, the ar balance also reflects receivables associated with new customer go-lives. on a go-forward basis, we expect dso to normalize in the 20 to 30 range. finally, we had approximately 55.2 million shares of common stock outstanding as of november 30.
now, turning to guidance. for the fiscal fourth quarter ending february 28, 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $51 million to $54 million, representing 18% growth over the prior year at the midpoint, and adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $2.4 million to $5.4 million. for the full year ending february 28, 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $162 million to $165 million, reflecting a $3 million increase to the range previously provided, which reflects 23% growth over the prior year at the midpoint, and adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $32 million to $35 million. and now, i'll turn it back over to raj for his concluding remarks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve. amidst incredibly challenging times, we remain focused on our mission and our vision to help every person lead their healthiest life. that single-minded focus has continued to lead to strong results for the company. with that, operator, i'd like to open the call up to questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from michael cherny from bank of america.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
congratulations on a strong end to your fiscal year. i want to dive in a little bit on some of that spend dynamic. i guess for a company that continues to expand its tam, seeing a spend to grow mentality is not surprising at all. but steve, you had some comments about remaining disciplined.
and so as you think about that spend, can you just walk us through again some of the metrics that you hold yourself against and making sure that the spend that you're pursuing, the investments you're pursuing are paying off in terms of growth and returns?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. and thanks for the question, mike. a couple of things. here's how we think about it.
if you think even going back to a year ago, when we laid out the company's plan going forward, we talked about believe -- a strong belief that we could grow the accolade core business 25% or more each year, and we've done that over the past several years; that we could take gross margins from the low-30s three years ago into the 40s through investments in innovation and technology; and consistently improve our adjusted ebitda loss, which was three years ago in the 40s and then progressed into the 41% and then to 25% and then this year at 16%, as we just ended. and now as we look in front of us and see a very large 10 times size of tam, we say to ourselves, all right, we believe we can grow, as we said in here, not only at that 25% core growth rate with accolade, but even faster with the addition of 2nd.md and with plushcare. and we do that with an eye toward, if we can continue to do so at attractive gross margins, which today in the mid-40s are attractive, we can -- we believe we can go higher, but we're going to make some smart investments here as we add these capabilities. and then that adjusted ebitda loss, we can take it -- it will remain roughly flat in fiscal '22 in that 15% or a bit higher range.
and then in the year after chunks down. what we're seeing there, mike, are the following: very strong attractive return rates on sales and marketing spend, which you see in terms of the acv growth rate and extremely high customer retention. and when you weave that together with the results from the aon study, the performance guarantees and the fact that we know we're saving money for customers and this larger tam, that tells us that we're doing the right things, and we're getting the right returns. and we believe strongly that doing so with that continued discipline and chunking down toward breakeven over the next couple of years as we grow at that kind of rate is how we think about that overall p&l discipline while we attack in the very early stages an extremely large market with a differentiated approach.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and as you think about the expansion of the market, you still also do have a core business that's performing fairly well with strong customer adds. how do you see the competitive dynamics playing out there in a market that a lot of companies coming at some different angles, but appears to becoming increasingly competitive.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
hey, mike, this is raj. thanks for the question, and thanks for being here. here's the way we think about the competitive dynamics and always have. we're in a category that we think that we largely invented 10 years ago.
and in that category, we've seen a number of companies over the last four or five years pivot into the space, looking at the value that's being delivered in the space. ultimately, our view is that in order to really deliver high-quality advocacy and navigation services and then weave in the incremental capabilities like second opinions and primary care that we're talking about today, you need to be able to invest in building long-term relationships on a longitudinal basis with individuals with a wide majority of that population. by and large, we think we're unique in our capacity to do that reliably with high percentage of the population, leveraging a differentiated data set that we've pulled together over the years. and then in turn, reliably prove the cost savings via things like the aon study that steve referenced.
you know, we put a percentage of our fees at risk with every customer that we serve. it's because we know we can deliver cost savings on an ongoing basis. there will always be -- particularly, anytime the leader in the space is growing at attractive rates, there'll always be new competitors in the market. our job is to continue to set the pace as it relates to the value that we deliver to our members and our customers.
and we think we've been pretty active in doing so over the last year.
operator
your next question is from the line of robert jones of goldman sachs.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. yeah. i guess just looking at the revenue guide and the disclosure about, you know, more than doubling the customer base, and appreciate the insight on how to think about 2nd.md, it does look like revenue per customer in the legacy accolade businesses is down a bit.
i was just hoping maybe you could share a little bit more insight into size of customer mix, you know, average pmpms, what type of offerings the newer customers might be turning on versus maybe like the legacy customer base? just anything around kind of bridging that gap between, you know, the overall revenue and the number of customers would be helpful.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure, bob. thanks for the question. steve. yes, as we've grown the business over the past couple of years, and you've seen our customer number accelerate, you've seen that happen across all of the segments, and we've talked a lot about how we segment the market into strategic customers, middle market and then enterprise in the middle.
much of the growth has happened on a pure logo count basis in the mid-market, which we consider to be customers with employees of about 500 up to about 5,000 as we've built out those distribution capabilities, formed partnerships with companies like humana and others to reach customers of all sizes. so you will see a bit of revenue per customer compression there by design. it's our job and our intention to be able to reach a broader set of the market. we also, from -- over the past couple of years, have introduced this multiproduct suite that has different price points.
so oftentimes, but not always, when we're reaching some of those smaller customers, we might start with a total benefits or a total care that's at that lower price point. the part that gives us great confidence, bob, about what we're doing there and the take rates is, we see consistent renewals, the very high retention rates that we talked about, and the wins that we're having in the market that's showing up in terms of the growth in this year's revenue, this past year revenue and the acv number headed into fiscal '22.
operator
your next question is from the line of ricky goldwasser from morgan stanley. you may ask your question.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. hi, good afternoon. so a couple of questions here. first of all, on 2nd.md, i think you're talking about growth of 35% to 40%.
it's a little bit higher than what we were modeling. so does this 35% to 40% includes cross-selling benefit? or is it the stand-alone growth profile of 2nd.md? and then my second question related to behavioral health. i mean, our channel checks and what we're hearing from payers and employers, there is real strong, especially post covid, demand for behavioral health. so one, what kind of demand are you seeing for your offering with the employer base? is it helping you win new clients? and then do you have any data points maybe to share with us around how behavioral health helps lower medical expense because i think you're always focused on, we really have to kind of like quantify it and do the study.
so if you can share any of those, that would be great.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
sure. let me jump in on this one first, ricky. first of all, thank you for being here, and thanks for the question. this is raj.
and steve, maybe you can jump in if you've got anything to throw on top. the -- first of all, as it relates to your question regarding 2nd.md, i think, positively, 2nd.md is a -- demonstrated an attractive growth rate in its core business, in large part because of its differentiated service it's delivered. and those capabilities are what attracted us to the company, the capacity to deliver a consult within three to five days, make it a live consult with an expert as opposed to a written consultation like the rest of the market. it has given the 2nd.md team a capacity to deliver great differentiation and competitive win-loss.
incrementally to that 35% to 40% growth rate, certainly, there's a little bit of cross-selling or there is a modest amount of cross-selling or upselling factored into that number. but -- and no doubt, we expect that over the years to continue to grow. as it relates to the bh question, first, let me jump in and give you a little color commentary on why we think it's so powerful within the context of what we do. and then i'll turn it over to shantanu to speak a little bit to the value that it delivers from a clinical perspective.
in our view, bh has long been wrapped into everything that we do. we've -- accolade's core advocacy and navigation services have always included behavioral health specialists as a part of our process. one of the reasons plushcare was so attractive to us was that it embedded a behavioral health element or a mental health element into the way primary care physicians were practicing, all of which is geared around the idea that higher-risk populations have a higher propensity to deal with behavioral health issues. and if you can deal with both the physical health issue and the mental health issue in tandem, you have an opportunity to materially improve outcomes.
shantanu, let me turn it over to you to talk a little bit about our clinical philosophy there.
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, absolutely, and i love the question. you know, a core part of the strategy, clinically speaking, was, you know, we wanted to get to the right members, right? we know that with mental health, one of the big challenges is that oftentimes those conditions go unrecognized and underdiagnosed. and that there's significant signal with them. so getting to the right member was a core part of it.
the second was, was that right decision, right? that Â you know, our perspective is that we just want to get people to the best possible provider for them. and so with mental health, you know, that might be a virtual provider, that might be a brick-and-mortar provider, that might require medication therapy, that might not. and so really getting to that best decision was critical. and then finally, the right path, that we know that often these folks don't necessarily follow up on the next steps, that sometimes that longitudinal support that they need to really be able to get through the entire recovery process is lacking.
and so we wanted to make sure that we're with the member every step of the way, ensuring that things don't fall through the cracks. and so what we're seeing in the very early data is, you know, this is a new solution that's been out for us less than a year, is that we're starting to see real traction among -- along those dimensions that we're pretty excited about.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
and ricky, this is steve. i just want to circle back to close the loop on your question about 2nd.md and their growth rate. and i think your point was cross-selling. you're right, 2nd.md is a rapidly growing business as well on its own.
we are very deep in the integration of combining the capabilities and accolade's capabilities into an offering that is receiving early strong feedback from the market. but it is early, and there's a relatively modest amount of assumed cross-selling in the numbers that we provided about guidance for this year.
operator
your next question comes from jailendra singh of credit suisse. you may ask your question.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. thank you, and thanks for all the color on acv on stand-alone accolade and 2nd.md. i know you have shared in the past how on stand-alone accolade side, you have captured acv across various quarters and how that is split across various buckets of fixed and operational performance and savings. can you provide similar split for 2nd.md acv, how should we think about the quarter capture there and the split across various buckets?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. jailendra, it's steve. with -- as we mentioned in the comments, 2nd.md's model is a bit different. they don't have the same types of pgs as accolade.
it's typically either a pmpm or in some cases, case rate. so the pepm model or that $37 million that i spoke about in 2nd.md's acv number is similar to accolade in the sense that it's a number that we would expect to earn. it's roughly members times a pepm rate on the books at the end of the year. and most of their revenue is generated -- 2nd.md's revenue is generated from that model.
there's certainly an additional part that is case rate and variable, price times quantity. that would be on top of that. and so that's included in the guidance, the revenue guidance, that is p&l guidance for fiscal '22, but that case rate portion would not be in the acv number.
operator
your next question comes from jeff garro of piper sandler. you may ask your question.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon. congrats on the results. i want to ask about your go-to-market approach. with the new acquisitions and the cross-selling opportunity that you've spoken about, just curious how you expect to balance the full vision you have for navigation plus expert medical opinion, plus virtual primary care while making sure your salespeople don't get too far ahead of themselves on the timeline for the step-by-step operational and technology work to achieve that vision.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, jeff. this is raj. and i appreciate you being here. and i appreciate the question very much.
at the core of the value we deliver to our customers, and we -- and i talked a little bit about this in my prepared remarks, is the foundational element of building a relationship, a trust-based relationship with a huge preponderance of the population powered by a data set that we think is extraordinarily differentiated. everything we add from there, whether that's second opinions, primary care, our own clinical programs, are all geared around adding incremental value to those populations by improving their outcomes and lowering cost. and so what you'll see in our integration strategy is, first and foremost, we're investing in integration. we want there to be seamless workflows, and we want the process to mirror the needs of the consumer as opposed to the silos that exist in healthcare today.
secondly, you'll see us embedding primary care and expert medical opinions in each of the core platforms that are a part of accolade's -- that are how accolade lands with customers today because we fundamentally believe both expert medical opinion and primary care add value to any member that we're serving regardless of the platform they're working with us on. and third, we're -- one of the things we really looked at in both of the acquisitions that we've taken part in, in the last couple -- in the last year, are technology stacks that allow integration to occur at pace. meaning, we talked at length about the idea that we wanted teams that were culturally aligned, services that were built around longitudinal relationships and tech stacks that allowed us to integrate at pace at scale. we expect that, that's true on both of the companies that -- one that we've already closed and the other that we expect to close next month.
and so we expect to be able to deliver these integrations at pace. and obviously, our sales teams are anxious for us to do so.
operator
your next question is from the line of ryan daniels of william blair. you may ask your question.
jared haase -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. this is jared haase in for ryan. thanks for taking the questions. raj, maybe for you, i was hoping to just, if you could talk a little bit about just generally the key themes that are coming up in discussions with the client base.
so curious if that's still largely kind of focused on sort of the return to work, getting people back into the office post-covid? or if you're starting to really see kind of a shift toward more of the clinical offerings, obviously, that you've added through m&a and things like that. just any thoughts there around the themes that you're hearing in the pipeline from clients.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yeah, of course, happy to. very clearly, more and more of our clients are returning to work right now to be sure. but i agree with the premise of your question or the sort of the direction you were leading me with your question around where the conversations are. healthcare spend is returning at some level across the country.
our customers are seeing that spend return. there's an acknowledgment that healthcare trend line in 2021 is going to be higher than the trend line that we saw in 2020. how customers are budgeting for that and how they're dealing with what we think are a profound set of needs in undertreated chronic conditions or in terms of behavioral health, are opportunities for our clinical programs, for our enhanced clinical programs to drive material value. it's a good opportunity for me, if you don't mind, to kick it over to shantanu nundy as well, our chief medical officer.
shantanu actually just published a book yesterday that's written about covid called care after covid, that's really about how we're actually dealing with a new wave of needs in the healthcare system post the pandemic. shantanu, do you want to talk about the clinical needs that our customers are facing that might be a little different than they were just a year ago.
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah. happy to, raj. and i absolutely love the question because i think you're right. i think, you know, for a little while earlier in the year, employers were largely focused on the pandemic, right, and just managing the uncertainty of that.
i think we're definitely seeing a turn in the conversations where our customers are increasingly sort of, you know, getting ready to get back to normal, which means they're concerned about those postponed elective care. and so that's where they're interested in, in second opinion. i think they're interested in getting -- get a handle of chronic diseases, you know, which many things sort of fell off during the pandemic. but i think the way that they're coming at those conversations is different, right? i think that during the past year, what they've seen is that health isn't just an hr benefits issue, it's also a business continuity one.
and that it's sort of magnified for them that the core challenges we have on the supply chain of healthcare are far more stark than they had imagined even before this. so issues like the access to primary care, the fact that 20% to 40% of americans don't have it, and that the reimbursement model for primary care makes it very fragile, right? the fact that mental health is core to what they need to be able to provide their employees, i think the opportunity that virtual provides. so i think what we're seeing, you know, early evidence of in the customers is a real change in mindset and sort of a larger aperture for getting even more involved in care delivery and for really connecting all the different pieces of the healthcare equation for their members.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hannah baade of d.a. davidson.
hannah baade -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
just a quick question on your growth in your customer base. i saw on the deck that accolade increased the target customer base from 21,500 to 30,000 for self and fully insured employers. can you unpack the delta between these? and maybe what portion is attributable to 2nd.md? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. it's just an additional data source on the number of target companies in the u.s., hannah, as opposed to a reflection on 2nd.md per se. it's more about the sizing of the mid-market of target customers, which as the level at which you can self-insure given the availability of stop-loss insurance at affordable rates even for small companies, has grown that market. so today, we're sizing it a bit larger than we were back at the time of the ipo in the range of 30,000 available companies.
operator
your next question comes from richard close of canaccord genuity.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
so, i'm still in. great. thanks. a couple of questions on competition and collaboration.
raj, i just wonder if you could address the view that employers are overwhelmed with all these different offerings, definitely referring to this week's journal article. are you guys hearing stuff like that from your customers in your discussions? and is that something that could impact the signing of new customers, especially, you know, as we think about large enterprises?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
richard, i appreciate the question very much. and i think, you know, there's certainly been a lot of conversation about the journal article. i'll say this. when we read the headline of that article, which spoke to benefits buyers being overwhelmed by the number of solutions that are being presented to them every day, it was as if they've been pulled off of our website or out of our presentation.
ultimately, the value proposition we deliver for our customers and for their employees and their families is to give them a single place to go. so if they're unsure of what benefit they should use or how to go about leveraging their benefits, all they have to do is ask accolade. our trusted supplier program is built around the idea of pulling all of their disparate programs together in a way that actually leverages our engagement engine, drives engagement and adoption up, and improves outcomes by getting people to leverage their benefits programs as well. and so do we agree? yes, we fundamentally agree with the headline of that article.
benefits buyers are overwhelmed. they would like to go to a single place to be able to manage their vendor relationships. and to the degree, they can reduce their vendor relationships by finding more value, and value is the critical term here that i'll expand on in just a moment, with a single vendor, they'd like to do so. but that value isn't about per se the right cost price per unit pepm or pmpm.
that value is about clinical value and about driving cost down. it's about improving member satisfaction. and if you can do those three things by weaving offerings together in the nature that we are, we think you have a winning proposition for the customer, reducing the number of vendors that they're dealing with, building longitudinal relationships with their people to make them happier, improving clinical outcomes and lowering cost. that is fundamentally aligned with the value proposition accolade has been talking about for 10 years.
operator
your next question is from the line of david grossman of stifel. your line is open.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thank you. i'm wondering if you could just remind us of how the integration of 2nd.md and plushcare get factored into the risk element of your revenue model. should we assume that once the integrations are fully completed that in fact, you can guarantee a higher level of savings post integration?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
first of all, thank you for the question. i think when we think about adding capabilities to our platform, like expert medical opinion, like primary care and specifically, with things like primary care, where we think we're adding value to a wide variety of our longitudinal relationships, we absolutely assess every one of those incremental capabilities with an eye toward, will it improve clinical outcomes, will it reduce cost and will it improve member satisfaction. we believe that's true for both of these capabilities. and we believe when embedded with -- in our platform, we can drive engagement for those solutions up in a way that improves our capacity to deliver incremental cost or value.
in my prepared remarks, i talked about the idea of driving negative trend line. we do fundamentally believe we can eat into the waste that exists in the system by delivering an integrated experience in a longitudinal form like the one we have today. how will that manifest for our customers? well, we've been putting our fees at risk since the beginning of the business, meaning we've been putting a percentage of our fees at risk since the company was founded. and today, for preponderance of our customers, a percentage of our fees are at risk associated with the savings we deliver.
we'd expect that to continue into the future, and we expect that we can yield more value from those relationships as we drive more cost savings for our customers.
operator
your next question comes from stephanie davis of svb leerink. you may ask your question.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. with the addition of the second opinion solutions and the virtual primary care announcement, i'd be curious if you're seeing any change in market perception from your employer clients. so two parts. one, are you seeing employers open to contracting directly with you for care? or is the market perception still leaning toward accolade as a third-party navigator that has value via its independence? and secondly, are you seeing customers open to shutting off their third-party virtual care in favor of yours? or is it more of an additive component to their overall care suite?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
i'm going to let shantanu jump in here because i know he's got five things that he wants to add to whatever answer i give you, so shantanu get ready. our strategy fundamentally is, and this has been true in terms of our customers' perception of us since the beginning, has been about improving clinical outcomes, reducing costs, and making people -- and driving engaged members who are happy with the service we deliver. and so in answering your question around customer perception, customers expect us to continue to deliver new value to them and are quite, in fact, excited about the new capabilities we've been bringing to their doorstep over the course of the last six months. second point i'd make there is, as it relates to our care delivery vehicles and how we collaborate with the marketplace, and this is where i'll turn it to shantanu, our strategy is fundamentally about improving outcomes for the people we serve.
and that means we will collaborate where that's appropriate. we're always going to get the people -- our members to the right place at the right time, including to our partners or to the brick-and-mortar healthcare system that exists. and so we're not really talking about replacing things. we're talking about enhancing a system that already exists in order to drive to better outcomes.
shantanu, do you want to jump in and speak a little to that model?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, absolutely. i think as you said, i mean, i think fundamentally, our sort of philosophy, right, is that we want to get our members to the right doctors and help them empower that patient, empower that doctor to get to the right decisions for them. and i think sometimes that may be providers that we have, that might be providers in brick-and-mortar, that might be through our partners. but ultimately, our north star is really making -- helping members make the best decisions so that we can get them to the best outcomes.
and i think where will you see second opinion, you see primary care is if you look at the healthcare system and you look at where are the places that often sort of fail patients the most, right, those are the places where we see an opportunity for us to connect the dots and ultimately help drive those better decisions, right? when you look at how many people that have cancer or that have surgeries that don't even have the right diagnosis or don't have the right treatment plan and how often when we get a second opinion that, that diagnosis or treatment meaningfully changes, right, that's a place where we see immense leverage for us to be more part of that solution. same thing for primary care, right? the statistics show, right, that 20% to 40% of the americans don't have a primary care physician. but if you dig deeper into what percent of patients don't have a strong primary care relationship and then if you go on the other side, i still get a chance to practice medicine and primary care every week, the challenges that i, as a primary care physician, have being able to provide the care that my patients need, right, simple things like i don't know what medications they've actually filled, i don't know if they were in the hospital recently, i -- when i prescribe a medication, i can't tell them how much that medication costs before they leave my clinic, those are the places where we see a tremendous opportunity for us to leverage the navigation service that we have, the data that we've built, the relationship we've built to really empower those physicians and, again, take a part of the healthcare journey that just is simply not working for enough people. and again, sometimes that might be our own and sometimes that might be brick-and-mortar doctors and really augmenting and supporting them in getting to those better decisions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david larsen of btig. you may ask your question.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
hi. can you talk a little bit about your relationship with tricare? it's my understanding that tricare has about 9 million lives in total. you've a pilot program going on with about 100,000 lives. and i was hoping to hear about sort of more in-sell potential with that particular client.
just any thoughts there around timing would be very helpful. thanks a lot.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
hey, david, thanks for the question. we are in now entering the second year of our tricare pilot. you may recall that last year, we announced we signed a three-year pilot with tricare that needed to renew at the end of each year. that renewal process has taken place, and we are now into our second year serving members and continuing to see great early indicators of the value we can provide, extraordinary satisfaction, and an opportunity to guide people to the right outcomes.
our belief is, to your point, that we have an opportunity to extend that value to more of the tricare population with the success of the pilot. and obviously, the extension of the pilot for another year is a great indicator of the opportunity to extend the relationship. and we don't have a lot to tell you today around incremental opportunities or the size of the incremental opportunity beyond the fact that we have 100,000 members today. and there's 9 million members in the broader population.
but we do like the leading indicators associated with the service we're delivering.
operator
your next question is from the line of ryan macdonald of needham.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. great. thanks for taking my questions. in regards to 2nd.md, you obviously talked about the mix of revenue being a combination of pepm, but then there's also sort of price times quantity case rate component as well.
as you look at the outlook that you've provided for 2nd.md, how should we think about the mix of revenue contribution between those two? and is there any potential tailwind to the case quantity amount as we look at a return of potential elective procedures throughout the year? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
ryan, thanks for your question. it's steve. yes, the case rate component is outside of that acv, number one, while the majority of the revenue that 2nd.md generates is on a pepm basis. you could think of it as a quarter to a 30%, a third, something like that of potential around case rate.
and as people are coming back into the healthcare system and more cases, there's potential tailwinds there. so we've included it in the guidance what we think is an achievable number, but there certainly could be that opportunity for upside. as we all know, we're all trying to figure out exactly how quickly people come back into the healthcare system. so we're taking -- we think it's a very prudent approach there, but certainly could be some upside on volumes as we move through the year.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the accolade 4q '21 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to hand the conference over to your host, todd friedman with ir.
thank you. you may begin.
todd friedman -- investor relations
thanks, operator. welcome, everyone, to our fiscal fourth-quarter and year-end earnings call. with me today are our ceo, rajeev singh; and our cfo, steve barnes. shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join us for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
let me first start by saying i apologize, we actually omitted the q4 table, although it has the summary numbers and the rest of the tables are correct in the release. so we'll issue an amended release shortly with the full table details for you. before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important in evaluating accolade's performance. details on the relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that's posted on our website.
also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results for accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on the call. for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh. 
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thank you, todd, and thank you all for joining us here today. fiscal 2021 was a year of transformation for accolade. we were extremely well-positioned at the outset of a global pandemic to be a source of help and guidance for our customers and for our members. and that led to opportunities for us to grow and to innovate.
we took advantage of those opportunities. among the highlights for the year were a consistent investment in innovation, which yet again yielded incredible value for our customers and our members. we delivered new offerings like accolade covid response care, intelligent provider matching. and a suite of integrated care offerings with partners that started with mental health with ginger.
additionally, it was our first full year deploying accolade total care and total benefits. combined, these offerings dramatically expanded our solution footprint. we can meet customers wherever they are, and we can grow with them as they evolve. that innovation paid off with a strong organic growth rate across all market segments, strategic, enterprise and middle market, which led to strong financial performance.
we doubled our customer base again to more than 100 logos covering more than 2.1 million members. and annual contract value increased 31%. additionally, we launched our pilot program with the defense health agency this past year. and very recently, we learned that we have received approval for the second year of our pilot.
this renewal is obviously a positive signal. accolade will now have a chance to continue demonstrating value in order to expand our presence with the tricare select population. we thank you for your support in our capital-raising initiatives this year as well, from our ipo in july to our follow-on offering in october to our convertible note offering in march. we were able to leverage that stronger balance sheet to close our acquisition of 2nd.md in march and to announce our intention to acquire plushcare in april.
2nd.md doubled our addressable market and added approximately 300 customers and 7 million members to our base. we've quickly moved to a more integrated model where expert medical opinion is now being sold together as a part of accolade total care and in add-on conversations with existing customers, we're seeing great traction with our customers for cross-sell and upsell opportunities. we're in the early days of integration and the acquisition is going as well as planned. upon closure of the plushcare transaction, we'll have grown our addressable market yet again to between $200 billion and $300 billion, more than 10 times our opportunity from the beginning of fiscal '21.
accolade today is an even stronger company than the one that went public in july. we're bigger in our size, broader in our footprint and attacking a materially larger addressable market, and most importantly, we're deeper with our customers and our members than we've ever been. and that's reflected in our record fiscal '21 financial performance. steve will, of course, give you far more details on the results, but a quick recap shows we came in ahead of our preannouncement on both the top and bottom lines.
for the year, revenue of $170.4 million grew 29% year over year and adjusted ebitda was a loss of $27 million compared to a loss of $33 million in fiscal '20. while we're pleased with fiscal '21, we see even more opportunity in growth in fiscal '22 and beyond. our vision is clear. we build long-term high-trust longitudinal relationships with members and their families, and we improve clinical outcomes and we lower healthcare costs.
those relationships are powered by our frontline care teams and an extraordinarily differentiated data set. aon has now independently validated twice in the last four years that we deliver on that vision with demonstrated results. as we add more value to those relationships via our own innovation, via partnership and via m&a, we further improve outcomes, and we drive better financial performance for our customers. it's as simple as that.
yet perhaps it's simpler for accolade rather than for others because our foundation is built on advocacy and navigation, a space that we pioneered and have led for years. advocacy and navigation are the building block services that create engagement and trust between our members and our frontline care teams. everything we do, whether it's in our core offerings or new areas like expert medical opinion and primary care, is made better by that trust. since our founding, we've invested significantly in building long-term relationships with a significant percentage of the members we serve, not just the high-cost ones.
when a member suffers an acute event or experiences some condition-focused inflection point in her healthcare journey, our success is rooted in the fact that we were already building a relationship with that member long before that event. it's an approach that differentiates accolade and is the bedrock of the results we deliver. our mission is for every person to live their healthiest life. our vision is to achieve the quadruple aim: better outcomes, lower costs, and delighted members and care teams.
our strategy for achieving that objective is innovation, partnership and m&a. looking at the year ahead, we see great opportunities on each of those vectors. our innovation road map will now include new clinical programs delivered both via partnership and internally. additionally, we'll be adding electronic medical record data case notes and test results to our already differentiated data set, further powering our artificial intelligence-driven next best action capabilities.
from a partnership and collaboration perspective, we expect our existing relationships with companies like ginger and virta, among others, to continue to thrive as we grow. and while we're at it, let's talk about collaboration with the ecosystem more broadly. healthcare is a $3 trillion ecosystem. no single vendor is going to solve the entire problem.
instead, our job is and always will be to do what's in the best interest of the people that we serve. that means we'll be collaborating with brick-and-mortar health systems, digital health providers and everything in between to get the best outcomes for our members. we will never stray from that principle. on the topic of collaboration continued, a brief aside here on carriers.
with the acquisition of 2nd.md, our already fruitful partnerships with carriers like humana and blue shield of california have now been joined by partners like optum, aetna, cambia, and others. increasingly, our capabilities are being viewed as opportunities for carriers to differentiate themselves, and we expect that trend to continue to play out in fiscal '22. and it is on the back of that success that we're taking the next step to realize our vision of reinventing healthcare with the addition of plushcare. our integrated care teams, now including primary care physicians with unprecedented data at their fingertips and proven support teams behind them, will be in a position to impact outcomes and deliver value for our members in a way that is unprecedented in the industry.
in the future, we expect to be able to reliably and measurably improve clinical outcomes for our customers while at the same time, delivering negative trend line, actually eating into the waste and misuse that plagues our system today. and we expect to share the value that we create for our customers when we do. our first discussions with customers regarding this pending acquisition and our offering strategy have been extremely well received, and we look forward to updating you on these conversations after the transaction is approved and closed. to turn this vision into reality, we're focusing on integrating these capabilities tightly with our core services and on retaining the incredible people who have joined or will join accolade as a part of these transactions.
our mission is to achieve the quadruple aim, and we are on our path to doing so. now i'll turn the call over to steve barnes, our cfo, to cover our results and forward outlook before returning for some closing remarks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, raj. i'll start with a report on our results for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and then provide a first look at our fiscal '22 guidance. we generated $59.2 million in revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter, representing 33% year-over-year growth, and $170.4 million for the full year or 29% growth over fiscal '20, both ahead of our initial and updated guidance ranges provided in january and march. as a reminder, we closed the 2nd.md acquisition after the quarter and fiscal year ended, so all of the revenue and growth reported is from core accolade performance.
revenue outperformance and growth in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to better-than-forecasted achievement of performance-related revenue and customer membership headcounts, including the airlines. fiscal q4 adjusted gross margin of 53.8% compared favorably to 50.8% in the prior-year period. remember that fiscal q4 gross margin is positively impacted by the recognition of performance-related revenue. overall, adjusted gross margin for the year was 45.6% compared to 44.6% last year.
adjusted operating expenses increased slightly to 49% of revenues in q4 of fiscal '21 versus 46% of revenues in the prior-year period. for the full year, adjusted operating expenses improved to 61% of revenues for fiscal '21 compared to 70% for fiscal year '20. with respect to future spending, fiscal '21 was an atypical year with lower-than-planned spending. in particular, we slowed down hiring at the start of covid and t&e spend was virtually nonexistent, offset somewhat by the increase in g&a costs associated with becoming a public company.
those areas will naturally revert back to normal in fiscal '22, including a bit higher on public company costs. even before we account for the integration investments in our acquisitions, i would expect spending to be higher as we catch up with that underspend in fiscal year '21. adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $2.7 million, which compares to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. this is a significant outperformance relative to our initial guidance provided in january and was significantly driven by the overperformance in pg-related revenue, which carries a high margin contribution.
and for the full year, adjusted ebitda loss was $26.9 million or 16% of revenue, which compares to a loss of $33.1 million or 25% of revenue in fiscal '20. turning to the balance sheet. cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year totaled $434 million. after the quarter ended in march of 2021, we paid $236 million related to the 2nd.md acquisition and received $245 million in proceeds after estimated expenses from our convertible notes offering.
so on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $443 million walking into the first fiscal quarter. next, i'll update you on our accounts receivable balance. ar decreased from the end of the third quarter to $9.1 million at the end of q4, representing about 14 days revenue outstanding for the quarter. this change primarily relates to a decrease in receivables from our airline customers.
and since the end of the fiscal year, the remainder of the airlines' ar balances have been collected in full. on a go-forward basis, we expect dso to normalize in the 20 to 30 range. finally, we had about 55.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of fiscal '21. and post the close of the 2nd.md transaction, we have approximately 58.7 million shares outstanding.
note that these do not include any shares related to the 2nd.md earnout or the proposed acquisition of plushcare. turning to the metrics that we report on annually. while our business continues to grow and evolve, the key business measures that we use internally to track our business progress have not changed. annual contract value or acv and gross dollar retention, or gdr, continue to be critical items for understanding the foundation, growth and health of the business.
the acquisition of 2nd.md and the proposed addition of virtual primary care will add new layers to the story, and we'll modify our ongoing disclosure as appropriate. and as always, our goal is to provide meaningful color that aligns our disclosures to the way we run the business as well as provide visibility into the foundation of our forecasting. one change that we will implement this year will be an update to acv, customers and member counts that we'll provide on the q3 earnings call after the primary selling season has concluded and we started the traditional january go-lives. and as of year-end fiscal 2021, stand-alone accolade acv was $211.5 million, 31% higher than a year ago.
2nd.md has a slightly different model with the majority of the revenue in a pepm model like accolade and a smaller portion in a case rate model. we will report the amount of annualized pepm revenue as acv in order to align to our historical disclosure. on that basis, 2nd.md adds approximately $36.3 million to yield a pro forma acv of about $248 million, representing an increase of 54% over the year-ago number. and gross dollar retention was 99%, equal to a year ago and above the level we typically forecast, representing another year of incredibly strong customer retention.
finally, we had 112 customers and more than 2.1 million members at the end of the year. and as we said before, 2nd.md adds approximately 300 customers and 7 million members to our platform. now turning to forward financial guidance. for fiscal '22, we expect revenue in the range of $260 million to $265 million, representing 54% growth over the prior year at the midpoint.
breaking this down further, we've said that we forecast the core accolade business at approximately 25% growth, and we expect 2nd.md to grow faster than accolade. so at the midpoint of this range, that represents approximately 35% to 40% growth for 2nd.md over their calendar 2020 revenue of $35 million, which we've reported previously. combining 2nd.md's $35 million in calendar year '20 revenue with accolade's $170 million in fiscal 2021 revenue, not a perfect science, but a good proxy would give you about 28% growth at the midpoint of the guidance range. i'll comment on plushcare in a moment, but we believe the addition of virtual primary care will enable us to maintain this higher growth rate beyond fiscal '22.
adjusted ebitda loss for fiscal '22 is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $42 million, representing an adjusted ebitda loss of approximately 15% of revenues at the midpoint. as we stated before, 2nd.md has gross margins that are similar to accolade and is not yet profitable on a stand-alone basis, and we are investing to accelerate and optimize the integration between our companies. for the first fiscal quarter ending in may, we expect revenue in the range of $54 million to $56 million, representing 53% growth over the prior year at the midpoint and adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $16 million to $19 million. now as you think about your models and our long-term targets, please always remember that maintaining a superlative member and customer experience is critical to our success.
when we make acquisitions, even as we invest in clinical process integration, distribution alignment and other operational needs, we will always have a primary focus on our frontline care teams, making sure they're equipped to serve members and customers at extraordinarily high satisfaction levels to drive favorable outcomes and cost savings. that means additional hiring, training, tools and technology to bring together multiple capabilities as we seek to reduce the complexity and cost of the healthcare system. these investments impact gross margins. so while our long-term gross margin target remains in the mid-50s, we expect to remain roughly flat in the mid-40% for the next year or two before progressing toward that higher target.
and i'll add one more comment about adjusted ebitda loss and the path to breakeven. adjusted ebitda loss improved year over year to negative 16% in fiscal '21 from negative 25% of revenue in fiscal '20, largely on the strength of our revenue growth, but also positively impacted by lower spend related to covid. with the addition of 2nd.md and the pending acquisition of plushcare, our tam will increase to more than $200 billion, and we plan to invest significantly in realizing that massively expanded market opportunity. in pursuing this even larger opportunity, we remain consistent in our bias toward top-line growth with attractive unit economics and a demonstrable path toward breakeven.
on that note, while we're not providing guidance for plushcare until our next earnings call after the transaction closes, we do understand that you're beginning to look at how this will impact the model. so let us provide a few comments. we've stated that plushcare's unaudited calendar 2020 revenue was approximately $35 million, and the acquisition will be accretive to our revenue growth rate. so you can consider plushcare about the same size and contribution as 2nd.md on an annualized basis.
plushcare's adjusted ebitda margin is closer to negative 20%, and we have said that we intend to invest on top of that in order to build out an enterprise virtual primary care business. prior to including plushcare, our guidance for fiscal '22 is for an adjusted ebitda loss of 15% of revenues, with a goal to improve that percentage each year to roughly negative 10% in fiscal '23 and then continuing to make consistent positive progress toward breakeven each year after that. so the addition of plushcare will likely raise those percentages slightly while maintaining that same goal of achieving attractive unit economics and consistent progress toward breakeven every year. and as i mentioned earlier, we believe that the addition of plushcare will enable us to maintain this higher revenue growth rate for the next few years at a minimum.
hopefully, this gives you a sense of how we forecast the business, run it with discipline and also show that our balance sheet is more than substantial to support a path to breakeven on a purely operational basis. and now let me turn it back over to raj for his concluding remarks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve. fiscal '21 was an amazing year for accolade, but we have even bigger aspirations for fiscal '22 and the years beyond it. i'll conclude by stating what is fairly obvious by now. the acquisition of plushcare and the addition of virtual primary care materially changes the contours of our business.
aside from opening a huge market opportunity, it opens the door for conversations with customers that will extend our relationships and deepen the value that we provide them. it creates a platform for us to lean hard on our track record of delivering value in the form of engagement, satisfaction and cost savings and change the way healthcare works in this country for our customers. as we've demonstrated with the innovation we've delivered this year with our fundraising activities and with two important acquisitions now, our aspiration is to play a material role in improving healthcare in this country for the people that we serve and to build a great and enduring business. we wake up every day and think about how to fix an industry that's responsible for half of all personal bankruptcies in the country, that represents 20% of the gdp and that grows at a rate that surpasses gdp, wage growth and most corporate profits.
if you're an investor in accolade, i think it's because you believe we have a chance to be that great and enduring company, and we truly appreciate the confidence you've shown in us. the past year has presented challenges that none of us ever thought we'd face, but we remain focused on our mission and on our vision to help every person live their healthiest life, and we're more motivated than ever to reach that goal. so thank you very much for being here. with that, operator, i'd like to open the call up to questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] please stand by while we compile the q&a roster. our first question comes from david grossman with stifel. your line is open.
david grossman -- stifel -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. you know, raj, you gave some observations about the selling cycle and, you know, what you're seeing, you know, year to date. and now that you've completed these two deals, i know you mentioned the integrated offering and going to market with that offering, but it's probably a little bit too early to comment on that.
but, you know, now that you've closed these two deals, you are meeting with customers at a point in time when they're making decisions. you know, what are their observations and questions about, you know, what it becomes and where their interests may lie going forward when we look at the integrated whole?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
yep. first of all, it's great to talk to you, david, and thank you for being here. i think it's a really important question you asked because our customers are just like we are, looking to the future. and in that look at the future, they're acknowledging that today they're oftentimes confronted with a complex healthcare system and too many solutions to weave together on their own.
oftentimes, our buyers today are carving out solutions from their local health systems and from their plans and looking to weave together their own ecosystem of solutions. and unfortunately, too many times, that's very difficult for them to do and they're seeing really low utilization rates. they hired us to solve that problem when they bought our advocacy services over the course of the years. what we've been able to do for the network of solutions that we've woven together that we have called our trusted supplier program is drive engagement not only for our own solutions but for the partners that we've brought to bear, and our customers see that metaphor.
they see that metaphor as it relates to primary care. they see that metaphor as it relates to expert medical opinion. and they can see how that metaphor is multiplied when that solution is under the accolade umbrella and going to be deeply embedded from a technology perspective, a process perspective, and a clinical perspective. and so, david, so far, our meetings with our customers have been extraordinarily positive.
they understand the hypothesis behind the acquisitions. they understand what they -- or what the long-term value proposition should be. and i think what they're looking for is more from us on the vision of how that integrations work, and that's what we're giving out.
david grossman -- stifel -- analyst
and then, as you kind of take that back to a comment you made also in your prepared remarks about, you know, offering stand-alone solutions for both, you know, 2nd.md and for plushcare, is that targeted at specific market segments or specific, you know, problems you're trying to solve for the customer, or is there more to it than that?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
you know, david, since we really got going here at accolade, the mission has always been to meet the customer where they'd like to be met. different customers are at different stages of their journey. and so three or four years ago -- or three years ago, we announced the various flavors of our advocacy offerings, meeting the customer at different price points with different engagement levels. we think the same story is true for expert medical opinion, where every single each of our buyer has that moment, where one of their employees gives them a ring and says some -- one of their family members has been diagnosed with cancer, ""what do i do?"" second, our 2nd.md or expert medical opinion solution gives them the answer to that question.
we think that same story is true on virtual primary care. our customers are looking for -- particularly, those who are wrestling with access and availability issues are looking for answers to questions like that. and as opposed to trying to shoehorn them into a particular solution, we want to solve their problem. and that's been the nature of the way we think about approaching the market forever.
david grossman -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you.
raj singh -- chief executive officer

operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael cherny with bank of america. your line is open.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
afternoon. congratulations on the nice quarter. i want to follow up a little bit on those selling season comments. raj, i think you made a comment saying that some of the cross-sell came earlier than you expected.
if you could characterize a little bit more about that cross-sell, is there any common traits that you're seeing between the customers and what's driving some of those -- that cross-sell capture an earlier pace than you would have expected? just trying to think through it. and also, think back to the expert second opinion deal you did where it seemed like you had a client there that was very excited about a potential cross-sell. i'm curious just to think about what we should be expecting and what's built into guidance as we move through the rest of the selling season and through fiscal '22.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
sure. let me take the qualitative part of that answer, and i'll leave the guidance part -- i'll leave the hard part of the question to steve. and i'll just answer the fun part. how's that? and the -- but first of all, thanks for being here, mike, and thanks for the kind words.
the -- interestingly, if you look at the mix of cross-sell customers that we saw in the first quarter since we acquired 2nd.md, we saw customers who were already in the process of evaluating 2nd.md, who were accolade customers, who made a buying decision. meaning, they were in the process of evaluating 2nd.md before the acquisition. we saw customers who began and close the evaluation after the acquisition began, and we saw customers who were looking at a -- or already on existing solutions and deciding to make a changeover since -- post the acquisition. so, all three varieties of types of deals closed.
and so, i think the good news is customers fundamentally understand that second opinion utilization is critical, that if you can get utilization rates above 2%, above 3%, that you can yield outsized value and extraordinary employee satisfaction, and that to the degree, they're not seeing that in some of the other vendors that they're working with, that they have a lot of confidence that they can do so with accolade and 2nd.md combined.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
and, mike, this is steve. i'll speak to a bit about the guidance and what's factored in. as raj mentioned, we're really, really excited about the early momentum with cross-selling that's occurring already. and we have, of course, factored some of that into guidance.
but remember where we are in the selling season, this really will become a more significant factor into fiscal '23, particularly with respect to revenue because as you know, most of our deals set up to be implemented during open enrollment and then launched on january 1. so, you could think of the revenue impact from cross-selling as fairly minor and at the $300 million to $305 million top-line revenue guidance we're giving for the year. really, has a lot more to do with core organic growth from accolade. and then, on its own, 2nd.md strong growth continuing there.
and then, plushcare as well. both of which you'll recall we signaled that -- those companies we expect to grow in the 35% to 40% rate on their own, so to speak, as we're bringing together that integration and coming to market, with accolade maintaining that growth rate on a core organic basis at 25% or so, which translates out to that guidance range.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect. then just one, hopefully, very quick follow-up. on the pull forward that you had on the at-risk revenue, the $1 million that you mentioned. can you just tell us, was that supposed to be part of the normal course of business that you would have recognized in 4q? just curious how pulled forward it was.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
that's exactly right, the way you described it there, mike. we expected it to occur later in the fiscal year, and we achieved that in the first fiscal quarter, and so recorded it there. so, we think it's important that you understand as you're analyzing those results. so, very strong first quarter for all good reasons around member accounts and pg performance on its own.
and then, you had that $1 million pulled forward from q4 into q1.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley. your line is open.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi. good afternoon. i have a couple of questions here. so, first of all, just trying to understand the upside on the quarter.
it sounds like, steve, that 1 million is from the pull forward of the performance payments. as we think about the remaining upside, what is from core and what's from upside to your estimates on 2nd.md performance in the quarter?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
great. hi, ricky. yes. a couple of things there.
if you peel apart and you'll see the 10q, which also either just got filed or will be filed imminently, we do pull apart the pro forma numbers for 2nd.md and accolade in the q. so, you'll get a chance to take a look there. you'll see the different components of it, and you'll see on a year-over-year organic basis that 2nd.md grew in the low 40s as a -- 40%, about 42% year over year. so, a very strong growth, big growth year.
and you could assume that that was -- we had guided toward a 35% to 40% range there. so, strong growth from 2nd.md. and importantly, with accolade, we're starting to see, you know, the negative effects of covid wear off a bit in a very positive way, meaning employee channels came up strong for accolade across our customer base, which is positive. and finally, with respect to pgs, as you know, we assume different elements of that around the savings pgs and the operational pgs.
and we've performed very well across all the different categories, customer satisfaction, engagement rates, and cost savings to the extent cost savings are booked early in the year. as you know, about 80% of the cost savings revenues do get booked in the fourth quarter. but some of those do get booked during the year. and so, it was a strong q1 across each of those different categories.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then, can you help us quantify the size of the investments that you're making to integrate the businesses? and as we think about those investments, should we think about them happening in fiscal year '22, or should we model elevated level of investments spilling over to 2023?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure, i can help you with that quite a bit there. if you think about -- let's work backwards from the guidance that we just presented. and i'll bounce it off of what you had seen previously. so, with the $300 million to $305 million top-line guide and the ebitda or adjusted ebitda loss guide of $49 million to $54 million, if you look at that step-up from what we provided last quarter prior to the acquisition, what you would see there is a few different elements.
one, we're investing significantly in the integration across the frontline care teams and the technologies that are supporting that, so that we can create an incredible experience for the consumers, who -- or the members, who are customers of the business, and for our frontline care teams to bring together each of these complex elements. so, where does that show up in our p&l shows up in the form of cost of revenues or gross margins, which has a lot to do with why we signaled to expect roughly flat gross margins this year. some of that investments happening on the frontline care teams. you'll also see it in product and technology.
so, we'll continue to invest fairly significantly there. so that number ought to be in the low 20s as a percentage of revenue. another area we're investing in, ricky, is across distribution. so if you look at the sales and marketing line this year, that number we expect to go up from what was in the high-teens in fiscal '21 into the low-20s as a percentage of revenue this year.
and that has everything to do with building out and expanding our go-to-market teams, the business development teams, and the underlying marketing teams who are building that broader story that raj spoke about in his prepared remarks and was just answering on a further question, which is piecing this all together in a way that would be completely integrated connectivity between navigation, advocacy, and primary care, and 2nd.md expert medical opinion elements. so, it really shows up across the p&l in those different ways bringing the adjusted ebitda loss into the 16% or 17% of revenue range this year and we'll continue that investment while we chunk down toward break-even over the next couple of years. so, that's very intentional that we continue to capitalize on the growth opportunity in front of us, while we also maintain that discipline toward break-even over the next couple of years.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you, steve. and if i could slide one last one, when i think about plushcare and when i think about who are you competing with or who are you replacing, it seems that the platform is quite extensive. so, should we think about plushcare is competing not just with primary care and behavioral health, but also urgent care?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
you know, ricky, i'll grab that one. it's great to chat with you. we fundamentally position our offering to our customers with the belief that the highest value we can provide is from a primary care and behavioral health perspective, and that that solution, of course, is in a position where when delivered and when implemented on behalf of the customer can also serve the needs of helping in urgent care situations. oftentimes, one of the things we see is that urgent care is in the lead in event that leads to a primary care relationship.
and so for our customers, i think that the baseline positioning in the umbrella under which we're delivering the offering is certainly primary care, but we expect that it will lead to urgent care and emergent care situations where we'll drop visits that way as well.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan daniels with william blair. your line is open.
ryan daniels -- william blair & company -- analyst
yeah, guys. congrats on the strong start to the year. just wanted to have a follow-up question on the sales pipeline. i know, again, this is a heavy part of the year for you and i'm curious if you're seeing more momentum toward the core products given the return to work and maybe a need to reengage a workforce after being absent for a year, or perhaps trying to keep a workforce engaged that's still working remotely to kind of drag cultural aspects through the organization.
is that helping you with conversions or in conversations with clients? thanks.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks again, ryan, and thanks for the question. in fact, you really hit on some of the macro tailwinds that we think are a part of what's happening in corporate america today. first, employee engagement is fundamentally a challenge for companies who are wrestling not only with return-to-work but a variety of other issues that have to -- have their employees and their families distracted. second, with return-to-work, there are a number of clinical and healthcare needs that are front and center to employees and their families.
and figuring out where to find them and help in a system that over the last 15 months has gone through a lot of shock is another tailwind and driver. and so on a macro basis, we think there are tailwinds that are driving what we continue to see as a growing pipeline and growing -- and a continued opportunity for the business.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jailendra singh with credit suisse. your line is open.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, and congratulations on a strong quarter. i want to go back to selling season discussion and thanks for highlighting and congrats on those contract wins. it seems selling season has been going really well for you guys. my questions are around, are you guys seeing any changes in the way employers like evaluating the alternatives on latest offerings given all the consolidation and changes over the past 12 months? even insurers are aggressively expanding and pushing for their own heart partner digital health solutions.
i'd also like -- related to that, curious on your costs around if you're seeing employers looking for best-of-breed blended approach or you're coming across employers having vendor fatigue and looking for a more comprehensive solution. just give us a little flavor around that.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, jailendra, for the question, and i'll try to wrap every element of that question up in one answer, and if i missed something please follow up, and we'll make sure to cover it all. as it relates to -- let's start with how our buyers are approaching the selection process in 2021 and how has that evolved from 2020. i think the single largest area that we point to is that increasingly, we're seeing buyers come to the table with the -- with a value orientation and a clearer understanding of what that value orientation is.
buyers understand that when you're seeing hundreds of solutions in the marketplace, that differentiating the pretenders from the real value drivers are going to be measured by value, clinical outcomes, lowered costs, and employee satisfaction. and that, increasingly, there is a demand that contracting vehicles and measurement and success measures are all geared around those value drivers. so, that's point one i'd say. that's certainly more profound in '21 than it was in '20, and we obviously believe that plays directly in our favor.
and, you know, incidentally, on that point, the idea of being able to prove that value with documented savings and documented reports is obviously very important as well. part two of that -- of the question i think is our companies are increasingly looking to find their answers from a single place where they can drive a compelling healthcare experience with deep integration, particularly around core drivers around longitudinal relationships navigation, primary care being two really good examples. and so, we think we're see -- that trend was -- has manifested with a wall street journal article a couple of quarters ago that talked about this, but that trend is manifesting across the industry, particularly i'd say, while it's absolutely true in strategic and enterprise accounts still under, middle-market accounts do not have the staff to really work through and understand the depth of all the solutions that are on the market. and i think those are two -- those, i would say, are two things that are evolving as '21 -- as we hit the midpoint of the '21 year.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, that's kind of you actually covered my -- the follow-up question because i noticed in your earnings release that some commentary around your value-based model for the plus times, so i just wanted to clarify that. i mean, can you give some examples to be more specific like how these contracts might look like and maybe to levels that you can have any value-based or restraining contracts with employers.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
well, jailendra, as you know, we take risks with our customers, about a third of our fees are at risk on an ongoing basis today. and so in that regard, do -- are we taking risk with any employers? every one of our employment -- our employer agreements today has that element of taking risk, and i think to the -- more of the point of your question around value-based arrangements, here's what we would point you to. we think the future is about extending that capability and tying it out to not just cost reduction but clinical value. and that is fundamentally going to be the future of the employer space and so we'll give a little bit more detail about how we're thinking about contracting when we deliver the integrated offering, which would be a little bit later this year.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then one quick question for steve. do you have got cash flow outlook for fiscal '22?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
we do. i think, jailendra, for us, you can consider that adjusted ebitda number to be a pretty good proxy for free cash flow. maybe a bit higher than that this year to the tune of a few million dollars for -- related to timing, but it's in that same ballpark.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
all right. great. thank you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, jailendra.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff garro with piper sandler. your line is open.
jeff garro -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. so, you've spoken about the, you know, very possibly about your health plan partnership.
i'm curious about what's driving success with those channel partnerships. and the second part of the question is over time, i would expect some efficiency, some leverage from using those sales channels. but are there still upfront investments to build those relationships that are part of the sales and marketing investments that you mentioned earlier?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
hey, jeff, great to talk to you. yes, there are some investments in building out new channel relationships with our carrier partners. we continue to be bullish on the opportunity to grow that channel and we continue to see organic expansion within those channels that have already been solidified clearly. once the relationship is solidified, we have an opportunity to grow within their customer base.
and yes, we absolutely believe that can be an efficient customer jet -- customer acquisition strategy and ultimately, you're seeing that in terms of even while steve mentioned the increase in sales and marketing spend this year, we're still seeing really extraordinary customer acquisitions, ltv ratios in the business. so, we're still very efficient from a sales and marketing perspective, and that's part of the reason why. i think the reason for our success with those channels is fundamentally in offering strategy that meets the customer where they want to be met. and so, we started with multiple forms of advocacy, that advocacy delivering core differentiation for carriers who might otherwise be unable to deliver that blend of technology, clinical capabilities, and advocacy.
we've been adding expert medical opinion in virtual primary care, we've added two new solutions that are really core to what customers are looking for, and therefore, added new tools that our carrier partners can take to their customer base to differentiate themselves. so that -- the breadth and depth of our services, i think, is one of the things that really attracts partners to what we do.
jeff garro -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
all right. i found that that helps. great to hear the differentiation, as well as continued focus on unit economics. so, second question from me.
just, you know, thinking about the outlook and the contribution from 2nd.md. maybe you could revisit the variable component of that business and how much seasonality you expect out of the business as we think about, you know, rolling forward the contribution in the first fiscal quarter throughout the rest of the year.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. and jeff, this is steve. great to talk to you again. so, 2nd.md, through their revenue model, has a couple of different ways that as part of accolade that we go to market with that expert medical opinion offering.
sometimes, it's a pmpm offering, sometimes it's a case rate price. but it oftentimes has a performance guarantee associated with it. and as you'll recall, the returns on an expert medical opinion service through the 2nd.md offering is very substantial. you know, it's something like $5,000 on average and it can exceed $25,000 or $30,000 when a surgery is involved.
so, it's quite an attractive return for the paying customer. the way that those pgs show up though is that unlike accolade, where we're deferring a lot of that savings-based revenue to the fourth quarter, 2nd.md recognize -- we were able to recognize those typically as the year goes on because it's a different construct. so, what you're going to see with accolade over time, jeff, is that fourth quarter, which today has a much more significant portion of a year's worth of revenue, it will start to flatten out a bit as we bring on-board. 2nd.md for a full year, plushcare, we just closed that transaction as you know, as you see that in this year's fourth quarter.
and then next year, when you're looking at that on a year-over-year basis, you'll see the seasonality of the revenue recognitions start to flatten out a bit, so it won't be as dramatic as it has been with accolade.
jeff garro -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
great. thanks for that.

thank you. our next question comes from richard close with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah. great. thank you. congratulations on the acquisition as well as the first quarter.
maybe just to, you know, hit on a couple of the questions that have already been answered or addressed but could add a little to it. with respect to, you know, talking with customers in the pipeline and, you know, the conversations around value and, you know, maybe some of the other companies that are, you know, looking at navigation, is -- are customers or potential customers confused at all? is there a lot of noise out there that you guys have to sort of educate the customer on? just curious, thoughts on that, first of all.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
raj. so, thanks for the question and i appreciate you being here. i think the best way to this -- i think your question is really, you know, let me try to rephrase your question make sure i'm capturing it, and then i'm going to come back to it with my view on it. the market is ripe with new entrants, innovation.
and sometimes, that noise can be confusing. is that noise confusing prospect buyers in the market, and how are they responding to that confusion? did i capture that well, rich?
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
correct. correct.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
ok. perfect. and so, i think you're absolutely right. the macro -- or the meta issue that you're discussing which is the plethora of solutions in the market is creating some confusion for buyers.
and it's not just buyers, it's consultants and brokers, and even carriers, who are struggling under the weight of having to keep up with the innovations in the market. we believe fundamentally that that part and parcel of why we're finding success in the market. it's not the only reason but it is a part of the reason customers view us as the platform for weaving together their healthcare ecosystem. the example i'd give you today, mckesson was -- that we mentioned on a call.
obviously, a large pharmaceutical company. mckesson purchased both accolade total health and benefits and expert medical opinion. you're seeing more and more companies look at the breadth of offerings from a single location where the -- it is the -- offerings can be integrated. we know they're going to be utilized, and we know one person is responsible for all of that value.
that confusion, we think -- confusion and noise in the market accrues to the value of platforms where we are in our view the right platform for our customers to weave all that value together.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then maybe, steve, if i can ask some question. i appreciate the flattening of the fourth quarter with 2nd.md and now plush being included.
but if more customers are moving toward value, wouldn't you have, you know, that value coming in, like you said, predominantly in the fourth quarter, you know, as value becomes a greater mix?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hi, richard, and i think i completely understand the question. it's early days yet for getting to the point where raj i think in answering jailendra's question is it's early days for us to move to a different type of contracting than we have today around value-based contracting and call it, you know, the next generation of that as we bring all of these capabilities together. so as we come back to you toward the late -- latter part of this year with more visibility around how that looks, we'll give you some color about the expectations around the financial model. but i wouldn't expect that to have a material impact certainly in fiscal '22 being the current fiscal year.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. i just wanted to clarify that. thank you.
congratulations.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, richard.Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, richard.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephanie davis with svb leerink. your line is open.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey, guys, congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question as always. i want to dig in a little bit about this trajectory toward an integrated care offering. how should we think about the value of a physical footprint? and this is something that you either think you can supersede as an m&a opportunity, or is it something that would need partnerships, so you can sell that last mile of care?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
i tell what, let me take that, excuse me. stephanie, it's great to talk with you.Â 
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
it's good to chat.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
sorry. i had a peanut right before you ask your question, and i'm choking.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
we've got to get that last mile of care to you now. or if you do.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
[technical difficulty] maneuver, raj, and a --
raj singh -- chief executive officer
seriously, i got so excited about that question i almost choked on a peanut. so, stephanie, first, great to talk to you. thanks for the question. the last mile of care is extraordinarily important.
let me take the first part of that question, and then i'm going to ask dr. nundy to engage and talk a little bit about the power of collaboration in terms of our model. for us, we do fundamentally believe that in a $3 trillion, $4 trillion ecosystem, the capacity to collaborate across the industry is imperative. we will be working directly with bricks and -- brick-and-mortar healthcare systems on the ground that are servicing our existing customers.
we think -- importantly, stephanie, and just after this, i'll turn it over to shantanu. importantly, one of the things that's so powerful about our model is that we can deliver the concepts of value-based care while running on the chassis of a fee-for-service healthcare system that doesn't require our customer to make radical change around the platform that they're currently running. and that's really important. we're not taking away choice.
we're not forcing them to make radical changes to their existing infrastructure, which they fundamentally would struggle to implement. instead, we can bring this really powerful concept to them and leverage everything that they're already using. shantanu, you want to jump in there and maybe speak to how we're thinking about that?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, absolutely. and, stephanie, i think it's such an important question. you know, i think, you know, from the clinical perspective, right, i think -- we think about the most -- the highest leverage point is the decision -- the clinical decisions that people make in their lives, right? and that decision is really upstream of the service itself. and so when you think about that number story that we started with of the number with, you know, with diabetes and the liver function issues, it really where the system falls down the most for that person is what we call the interstitial space, right? it's like the space between visits where people have to go home and now make those decisions every day about their health and well-being.
and so for us, that's where, you know, we thrive. that's what, you know, we've done and traded over the past decade-plus. and so we think that sets up a really nice way to collaborate with the ecosystem where it's really saying, hey, we're going to help people get to better decisions, we're going to be accountable for that. we're going to guide them through, you know, the 5,000 hours that they're not in a physical brick-and-mortar environment, but we absolutely see the need for that brick-and-mortar service.
we just want to make sure that people are ultimately getting the right care that they need to get to the outcomes.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
i guess to follow up on that one. do you read the kind of venue of care up to the client, or is this something where you might want to steer them toward some of these more hybrid or risk-on models that are starting to appear just given their claims of improved roi and cost-saving?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
again, we'll tag team this one. i think it's -- stephanie, one of the things that we pride ourselves on is our capacity to get people to the right care by leveraging the tools that are in our tool bag as it relates to our intelligent provider matching capability that weaves together cost, quality, and appropriate care measures. our expert medical opinion capabilities, which allow us to ensure that we're on the right track in decision support. i think the addition around areas that are focused on quality and cost and focused on measures like the measures that we're focused on with our customers are clearly going to be interesting to partner with us on behalf of our customers.
shantanu, would you add anything there?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, i think i would add i think part of -- i think what you're getting at with your call of questions, stephanie, i believe is really, you know, that as, you know, brick-and-mortar sites move to value-based care as many employers have, you know, onsite clinics or they have particular brick and mortar or local assets that they've developed partnerships with, you know, how does that fold into our model, i think that's maybe part of your question, and i think --Â 
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
you're reading my mind. that's exactly it.Â 
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
ok, perfect, perfect. yeah, and i think the short answer is absolutely. i mean, already, you know, today, we have a number of customers that have, you know, onsite clinics. i think absolutely as the market continues to move toward more value-based providers, i think there's real opportunities to be able to provide differential value, getting members to those environments.
even those that are getting care at those local accountable care organizations, they're still missing a lot of the data that they need to really serve those members. and those members are still going to have other care needs that may or may not be best served by those local providers. and so we absolutely think that building on the capabilities that raj talked about that, you know, we're going to be able to construct those ecosystems to ultimately get to the outcomes that employers are looking to get to.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
very helpful. thank you both.Â 
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david larsen with btig. your line is open.Â 
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
hey, congratulations on a good quarter. can you maybe talk a little bit about your long-term expectations for gross margin? i fully understand that there are investments going into integration this year for plush and 2nd.md, but as we think about like fiscal '23 and beyond, where would you expect gross margins to trend? what will get you there and over what time period? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
david, this is steve. great to talk to you. you're right. absolutely, taking gross margins up over time is part of our plan and expectation while we invest in that part of the business this year and into next year.
roughly flattish this year. so think of that as mid-40s with a long-term target into the 50s, call it the mid-50s over the longer term. i think what you're going to see though is this year and really into next year, similar types of gross margins in that mid-40s range to bring all of these capabilities together to great -- create that fully integrated experience that drives the kinds of health outcomes and cost savings that we think are critical that are driving the growth in new customers and the very high retention rates we have with existing customers. now, over time, how will we take that from the mid-40s up into the 50s? it'll be through a few different things.
very importantly, continuing to build out the technology platforms that create integrations that help our frontline care teams be more efficient. so it's leveraging the ai and machine learning engine to do something we call the next best action to help our frontline care teams know what would be the next best thing to recommend or were someone to direct -- where to direct a member elsewhere in the ecosystem. that all, as we automate that more, makes our teams more efficient. by the way, raj alluded in his prepared remarks, we'll have a segment -- an analyst segment on data coming up over the coming weeks that will go deeper into that.
and then secondly, as we cross-sell and upsell, there's leverage and operating leverage on the business overall, including on the gross margin line. as we are successful with transactions like raj mentioned with mckesson and selling total health and benefit and expert medical opinion. that combined offering, there's certainly leverage that we have on the frontline care teams that equates to improving gross margin at the margin if you will. so there's opportunities there.
those are two big factors where we think of driving gross margin improvement over time.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks. that's very helpful. and then we've heard from a couple of health plans like, first of all, they're very large health plans that are very much aware of accolade.
and we've heard a comment here and there like accolade is doing such a good job, they're taking away some potentially like fully insured business from us because if the, you know, employer groups can purchase a self-insured product at a lower price point then use accolade, they can get all the benefits. have you seen any large health plans sort of react to accolade and try to bring in some of the services themselves? have you seen any i don't know if backlash is the right way to describe it, but i mean, i'm assuming the answer is no given how good your sales are? but have you seen large plans respond to your efforts here in any way that's been unexpected lately? thanks.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
i appreciate the question. i think, you know, for us, and we talked about it a little bit earlier, we're finding increasingly that carriers understand, and i'm going to actually flip your question and take it in a positive way. they're looking [technical difficulty] and acknowledging that we can add value to them with our differentiation. and so we acknowledge as well, though to be clear, that they're going to be moments where there's a level of competition, where we're going to exist in a market and compete where they've got their own advocacy solutions.
but yet, when we win those opportunities, we have an opportunity to collaborate with them and serve the customer well. and so i think the short answer to your question is no, the longer answer i'll give you at the end of the call.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
ok, great. congrats on a good quarter. thanks very much.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan macdonald with needham. your line is open.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a great quarter. raj, you mentioned that, you know, behavioral health is continuing to have a strong impact on the selling season, and this is something we've heard similarly with the organizations that we've spoken with. but there's still this added layer of complexity there within the different behavioral care health models of trying to navigate that. as you look at the evolution of accolade and with your partnership with ginger and the mental or the behavioral health component that's included with plushcare, can you talk about how you're positioning those two as you start to integrate plushcare more directly into your selling model? thanks.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, ryan. glad you're here. i'm going to hand that question over to our chief medical officer. shantanu?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, it's such an important question because you're right, it's so top-of-mind, and we're seeing that come up over and over again from our customers, the concern about emotional health and mental health. i think the short answer is, you know, we don't think that there's, you know, a one-size approach, right? to your point, you know, behavioral health covers a very broad gamut from, you know, depression anxiety to emotional health, to substance abuse, to the more atypical psychiatric conditions. and so, you know, we think that, over time, there's going to be -- it's going to require multiple types of services integrated together to ultimately meet the needs. part of the challenge, as you know, is scale.
i mean, there's just, you know, there is a shortage nationally of therapists, shortage nationally of psychiatrists. and so really thinking about an approach that can meet our employers' very, very broad needs while also maintaining high quality in outcomes is really what we're focused on.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
excellent. as a follow-up for steve, steve, you know, it's obviously very early days in the integration of both acquisitions, but just curious to get your thoughts on maybe some areas of upside surprise in terms of synergies that you might have discovered that maybe you didn't expect sort of pre-acquisition as we think about the businesses being integrated. thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. hey, ryan. i think that the most positive upside we're seeing is on the go-to-market opportunity that really raj spoke about earlier. we're seeing very strong reception from our customers and prospective customers around the integration of the offerings and the opportunity we have to not only optimize but to drive more and better utilization of the services.
strictly, you know, the mckesson example with buying expert medical opinion along with total health and benefits is a great example, and we're seeing that across the business. and i think just in -- on the ground, the way we're working together with the teams with accolade and 2nd.md has been really incredible, like-minded, people with a common mission to improve healthcare -- massively improve healthcare has been really the backbone of the early success we've had there. and we're also seeing a similar with plushcare in the early days here. so it's mostly about top line and the tam expansion opportunity.
and it's been extremely positive so far.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thanks again.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the accolade first-quarter 2022 earnings results call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, todd friedman. please go ahead.
todd friedman -- senior vice president, investor relations
thanks, operator. welcome, everyone, to our fiscal first-quarter earnings call. with me on the call today are our chief executive officer, rajeev singh; and our chief financial officer, steve barnes. shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join us for the question-and-answer portion of the call later.
before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating accolade's performance. details on the relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements, as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results for accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call.
for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh. 
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, todd. and thank you all for joining us. it's an exciting time to be here at accolade. we're one month past the close of the plushcare acquisition and are well underway with the work of integrating accolade, plushcare, 2nd.md into a single business.
combine that with the excellent financial results to start the new fiscal year and the return of our first wave of employees to our offices, which we're very excited about, as well as a sense of normalcy returning to the communities in which we live, and there is a strong feeling of optimism at accolade today. my reasons for optimism are grounded in the simple belief that we can deliver differentiated value for our customers. when i joined accolade nearly six years ago, it was clear to me that the foundation of advocacy and navigation would be the cornerstone of a richer set of services that could one day bring value-based care to the employer of the healthcare market. advocacy provides the foundational platform of broad engagement, longitudinal relationships, and a rich dataset that makes every incremental service that you add to it better.
that evidence originally came in the form of partner relationships via our trusted supplier program and would eventually validate a bold acquisition strategy geared toward assembling the industry's richest set of tools for engagement, cost reduction, and improving clinical outcomes. most importantly, our customers have been energized by these new capabilities and their potential for value. we're deep into these customer conversations and hard at work outlining for each how our enhanced solutions will do even more for their specific populations. additionally, our integration and innovation teams are working feverishly to launch a fully integrated offering, one seamlessly combining advocacy primary care and expert medical opinion.
our mission is to create a healthcare experience that finally puts the consumers' needs first, and we cannot wait to show you how our vision for the future translates to an integrated offering. for today, i'll spend time talking about our early progress, initial successes, and high-level plans to change the industry. first, a quick review of the quarter. revenue and adjusted ebitda were both ahead of our guidance.
revenue of 59.5 million was 66% greater than last year, and an adjusted ebitda loss of 12.8 million reflects some of the investments we told you we planned to make in integration and the launch of a new enterprise primary care business. steve will provide more color including some high-level comparisons to account for the impact of our 2nd.md acquisition. from a business standpoint, i want to touch on a few key highlights from the quarter, including the integration of 2nd.md and plushcare, a positive start to the early selling season, and the growing importance of behavioral health. i'll start with 2nd.md.
in just three months since we closed the acquisition, we've signed our first cross-sell customers with organizations like the city of fort worth and a fortune 50 insurance company, adding expert medical opinion to their existing advocacy services. these early cross-sell went more rapid than even we expected, along with 2nd.md's continued new business success validates our hypothesis of the transaction very clearly. additionally, as we announced when the transaction closed, an expert medical opinion is now a core component of our total care offering. the value proposition, and more importantly, the measurable impact on employee well-being and health outcomes have immediately been apparent to our customers.
not only have we seen cross-selling success, but our first joint customer went live on july 1st. we're optimistic about the pipeline of expert medical opinion deals for the remainder of the year as well. most importantly, members' nps scores for expert medical opinion remain at historically high levels above 90. it's july, so we're in the prime summer months for the traditional healthcare selling season.
for those of you who are new to our company, large employers tend to make big decisions related to their healthcare and benefits plans in the summer in anticipation of fall open enrollment and a january 1 launch. as we've told you before, with our addition of new capabilities and expansion of our target customers to include businesses of all sizes, we are selling throughout the year. however, it's still an important time in the industry and we've had a very positive set of success with both renewals and new business. we signed deals in the first quarter in each of our customer segments -- middle market, enterprise, and strategic.
in addition to some of the notable deals i mentioned for 2nd.md, we also signed mckesson, a fortune 50 pharmaceutical company, for total health and benefits, our premiere offering. we also saw key expansions in the populations we're serving with humana, as well as notable customer wins via our new health plan partners would establish relationships with 2nd.md prior to the acquisition. one, in particular, was a fortune 100 financial services firm that has been served by two national health plans. i note the multi-carrier dimension because while it is one customer selecting 2nd.md, our ability to meet the needs of their full employee base relies on the strength of our relationships with multiple carriers.
one other note that i will call your attention to, one year ago when we went public, we outlined the multiple flavors of advocacy offers we bring to market with the belief that customers who choose our lighter touch offerings might begin to upgrade more fulsome solutions down the road. in fiscal q1 we saw our first upgrades from total benefits and total care to total health and benefits. one of those was the pepsi-cola and national brand beverages group, which is the second-largest franchise bottler and distributor for pepsico covering the mid-atlantic. finally, we're continuing to see an increase in interest in mental and behavioral health.
this past quarter, we signed more customers to our mental health integrated care solution with ginger. incrementally, we're incredibly excited about the embedded mental health capabilities in our new plushcare primary care solutions. as covid has exposed the incredible mental health crisis in the country, we believe our ability to provide a multifaceted behavioral health solution to customers integrated with the most critical touchpoint, primary care, is going to be very meaningful to our customers, their employees, and their families. and that's a good segue to transition to plushcare.
first, while it has been less than 30 days since the acquisition has closed, we've already had the current plushcare solution, as well as our expanded primary care strategy in front of a number of significant customers. our field teams have all been trained on plushcare and all our new solutions, and we're actively executing on a cross-sell upscale strategy that is looking very positive. when we announced the plushcare acquisition, we talked about a parallel strategy of continuing to focus on the existing direct consumer business while building out an expanded accolade primary care strategy that leverages the core strengths of our navigation, advocacy, and expert medical opinion offerings. the core plushcare business has continued to perform very well.
in fact, while traditional urgent telemedicine providers talked about a post-covid return to lower growth level, plushcare has continued to grow subscriptions and visits. we'll share more about that when we report our first combined quarter in october. on the broader enterprise primary care model, that work continues, and we plan to roll out that strategy in the near future. one thing we haven't talked about previously is our plan to operate fully featured solutions for primary care on a stand-alone basis to customers in the quarters ahead.
for many customers, especially those in the middle market, the existing plushcare platform is a powerful primary care offering that our customers can begin using immediately. it's a testament to the combined execution of both the plushcare and accolade teams that we're able to move this quickly. next, i'd like to share a member story from a plushcare position that i think is a good allegory for our broader primary care strategy. this story centers on a member who lives in a rural area far from a medical office, a problem for many of our customers' employees, by the way.
suffering from stable hypertension, she had reached out to plushcare for help refilling one of her three blood pressure medications. the member was complaining of fatigue, but she didn't want to go to the hospital because of covid. a typical transaction-focused telemedicine provider might have simply refilled the medications. the plushcare primary care physician built a relationship and convinced the patient to have a home blood testing kit sent to her.
the testing kit revealed something serious and a requirement for more tests. her glucose, liver, and kidney levels were very elevated, and her a1c was twice the normal level. the members thought her hypertension medication was out of balance, but in reality, she had undiagnosed advanced type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. at this point, you can see the incredible difference in the plushcare approach compared to traditional urgent telemedicine.
the plushcare position discussed a number of potential therapies including medications and lifestyle changes. the plushcare nursing staff guided the patient on glucometer use and self-monitoring for type 2 diabetes. the plushcare off staff engages with the patient, the pharmacy, and the physician to ensure that the correct supplies were ordered and delivered to the patient. the patient refused insulin, so constant monitoring, follow-up, and testing were necessary.
after one month, the patient had adopted new behaviors recommended to her by her plushcare team, including installing a treadmill in her home and changing her diet. her blood sugar levels dropped by half. three months later, her a1c levels had dropped by half, and her kidney and liver levels were back to normal levels. her blood pressure also dropped, so the physician was able to discontinue two of the three medications.
at the next follow-up, her levels had dropped even further to the point that she was no longer even considered pre-diabetic, and her blood pressure was in a normal range. this was a terrific example of a patient who had clinical success despite having limited insurance coverage in a rural area with no close access to specialty care. and arguably, she was successful because of the virtual care approach since access to a brick-and-mortar facility was a barrier. those barriers exist across the country.
it could be related to location or socioeconomic factors or race. we have the opportunity to break those barriers and change the way care is delivered. when the plushcare primary care doctor that delivered this care told this story, she talked about the difference that would have been made if the member had been engaged with accolade before she knew she had this issue. this member, with her hypertension and multiple medications, would already be on accolade's radar through our ongoing monitor plans, and likely actively engaged with the help of an assistant or nurse.
when the member reached the plushcare physicians, the doctor would instantly have all of the patient's medical history, list of medications, critical insurance information, and all the other benefits that the member's employer might be providing. an integrated medical expert opinion specialist might have been engaged sooner. and when it comes to the necessary supplies and follow-ups for this treatment and beyond a comprehensive ongoing relationship, a physician in the plushcare care team would now have the extended capabilities that come with the accolade frontline care team. as we look to what's next, this real-life example clearly outlines our opportunity to fully integrated a data-driven approach to improving the well-being and overall health of our members is the goal, and we now have a rich set of assets to achieve it.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to steve to cover financials.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, raj. first, i'll recap the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. keep in mind that we closed the 2nd.md acquisition on march 3rd, just a few days into our first fiscal quarter. where appropriate, i'll provide color on the year-over-year comparisons beyond the tables in the press release.
the plushcare acquisition closed in june after the first quarter ended, so there's no plushcare contribution or impact in any of these results. we generated $59.5 million of revenue in the first fiscal quarter, representing 66% year-over-year growth on a gaap basis over the prior-year period. in our 10-q, we provide pro forma results for the combined business that shows 35% growth year over year. as we provide pro forma results per sec requirements for the rest of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that we're selling our solutions both together and separately.
so while the reported pro forma revenue growth and profitability numbers are intended to reflect the acquisitions as stand-alone, it may not always be a perfect representation of how we sell to customers and run the business overall. as a quick example, we sell expert medical opinion as part of accolade's total care, as an upsell, and as a stand-alone solution. some of that would be reported as 2nd.md revenue for pro forma purposes and some would be recognized as accolade's revenue. the revenue outperformance relative to guidance was largely attributable to solid execution on multiple fronts.
both customer member accounts and performance-related revenues exceeded the expectations built into our fiscal q1 guidance, including the timing of achievement of a customer performance guarantee that pulled forward approximately $1 million of revenue into the first quarter, which also positively benefited adjusted ebitda. fiscal q1 adjusted gross margin of 14.2% compared favorably to 38.3% in the prior-year period. as stated on the q4 call, we expect the adjusted gross margin to remain relatively flat this year. adjusted operating expenses decreased slightly to 62% of revenues in q1 of fiscal 2022 versus 65% of revenues in the prior-year period.
and adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with a loss of $12.8 million, which compares to $9.4 million in the prior-year first fiscal quarter. turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the first fiscal quarter totaled $425.5 million. note that during the quarter, we paid $236 million related to the 2nd.md acquisition and received $245 million in proceeds after estimated expenses from our convertible notes offering. and after the quarter ended, we paid approximately $53 million related to the plushcare acquisition.
so, on a pro forma basis, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were approximately $373 million, heading into the second fiscal quarter. accounts receivable increases from the end of fiscal 2021 to $15.3 million at the end of fiscal q1, representing about 24 days revenue outstanding for the quarter, consistent with our last update on the expectation that dso is normalized in the 20 to 30 range. and the increase in ar over the prior quarter relates primarily to the acquisition of 2nd.md. finally, we had approximately 58.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of may 31, 2021.
and note that this does not include any shares related to the 2nd.md earnout or the acquisition of plushcare. so, for your models, you should include approximately 7.1 million shares issued for the plushcare acquisition in june. additionally, there are up to approximately 2.2 million shares related to the 2nd.md earnout and up to 1.4 million shares related to the plushcare earnout to be issued in calendar 2022. and now, turning to guidance.
for the fiscal second quarter ending august 31, 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $69 million to $71 million, which includes plushcare revenue from june 9, an adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $22 million to $25 million. and for the fiscal year ending february 28, 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $300 million to $305 million, representing 78% growth over the prior year at the midpoint of the range. breaking this down further, we've said that we forecast the core accolade business at approximately 25% growth, and we expect 2nd.md and plushcare to grow faster than accolade. if you assume a full-year plushcare contribution and combined plushcare and 2nd.md's calendar 2020 revenue with accolade's $170 million in fiscal 2021 revenue, it would give you about 30% growth at the midpoint of the range.
adjusted ebitda loss for fiscal '22 is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million, representing an adjusted ebitda loss of approximately negative 17% of revenues at the midpoint. this is consistent with the color we provided last quarter and at the plushcare close to expect approximately negative 20% adjusted ebitda margins from plushcare and incremental investment as we build our enterprise primary care business. and now, i'll turn it back over to raj for his concluding remarks.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we take any questions, a couple of quick announcements. please keep an eye on your inbox for a couple of upcoming events. we heard good feedback following our deep dive session on expert medical opinion.
so, we're planning the next session later this month, which will focus on data. we're also getting ready to host our annual customer event again in september. attendance will be limited to customers, but we do plan to webcast the keynote and host an analyst q&a session. please reach out to todd for more info if you don't get an email with those save the date details.
operator, with that, i'd like to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from jailendra singh of credit suisse. your line is open.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for the color on the economics. but i want to better understand the economics for accolade one around how value-based pricing is going to work. so will you be taking any downside risk? or is it going to be all upside potential? and i know you talked about accolade one will not contribute until fiscal '24. but i was wondering if any early feedback or interest level you can share from your customers at this point?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
jailendra, it's steve. let me start off with the pricing model and have raj weigh in a bit on some of the early customer feedback, and we can hit some of the expectations on when we'd expect that revenue to flow. so think of accolade one as the comprehensive offering with the integration of all of our capabilities, ok? and as raj mentioned in his comments, this is likely to start as an upsell to customers that are already taking advantage of some of our solutions. the revenue model, let's compare it to accolade total health and benefits because i think that's a good way to start.
importantly, we want you to think of this as a fees at risk model. this is not to be thought of as a fully capitated medical risk model like a medicare advantage model. think of it more this way. if you think of our typical total health and benefits customer, having something like 70% of our pepm fees fixed with 30% on a performance basis and about 10% of that on a savings basis, what we're looking to do is as we drive more savings for the customer, is to have accolade participate in that additional savings to the upside.
now to your point, on the downside, we think about it roughly this way. we may go something like 50% fixed instead of 70% fixed. and then have some upside to call it, 125% or 130% to take advantage of that additional savings on top of the 100%, if you want to think of it that way, on a gain share basis. importantly, jailendra, we go back to the point that we have a track record of earning 95% of our pepm fee and view that downside risk as highly manageable and on the upside, the opportunity to participate in the additional savings that we would expect to occur because we're going so much further beyond just the advocacy offering into clinical areas around virtual primary care, mental health and expert medical opinion that we think ought to drive that additional savings.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
and just a follow-up to that. great to talk to you. thanks for being here. this is raj.
just jumping in on the customer interest. we obviously have two customers already that we've announced as vanguard customers. those two customers are actually in process of preparing for deployment, going into the pilot period. we also have significant interest coming out of evolve, where a number of our customers have reached out to us and scheduled time to go through what accolade one is, how the integration will work and how the model will work.
and so it's a little early to give you much color on how many customers will embrace it. but what we can tell you is feedback from evolve, interest in terms of generation of pipeline has all been positive.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then my quick follow-up on the ebitda guidance update. can you provide more details on what are the new incremental costs you're reflecting in second half, which is resulting in full-year guidance unchanged despite ebitda coming in better in the quarter? is it related to all kind of labor market situation? or is there something else going on? just help us understand the ebitda guidance update.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. primarily, jailendra, it reflects additional investments as we're thinking about the combined offerings and taking them to market. so you'll see in the fiscal second quarter results when you look at the opex line, you'll see the sales and marketing line growing a bit into the low 20s -- low to mid-20% range as a percentage of revenue. that reflects go-to-market investments that we're making.
you also see some of that spend in the product and technology line. and certainly, there are some impacts around wages and labor that are flowing through there as well. i wouldn't point to that as a material factor. i would really point to the investments we're making around the new offerings.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from michael cherny of bank of america. your line is open.
mike cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
appreciate again all the details as well. raj, you spent some time at the beginning talking about some of the marquee wins you had both within the core and then obviously, you talked about the vanguard wins in accolade care. can you give us a little bit more qualitative big picture overview on what was going on in the selling season? what activity levels tended to be like versus previous years? and at least in terms of how you were thinking about the rollout and some of the wins that you've been able to generate, do you feel comfortable with how things shook out versus where your plan, your team, your sales force was incentivized to go?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
mike, first of all, great to talk to you. thanks for making time for us. we're about now a little bit into the third quarter of the year. and what we found, i think a couple of things that i tried to call out in some of my prepared remarks.
first, by entering the care delivery space, we've materially expanded our market. and so we actually both saw two vanguard customers for accolade one but also two customers for accolade care, an offering that we actually just announced in late september. and so the idea that we're seeing that pipeline develop, we're also seeing expansion to that pipeline, we're really excited about. also, in pointing out that we actually saw customer signings in every core segment across every one of our products or offerings, also pointing to the fact that we're looking at the demand environment, seeing an expanding pipeline, seeing continued wins with major customers.
one of the major customers, i mentioned a major hospitality corporation. we just got approval to say their name. it's hyatt corporation. it just happened a little bit before we published our press release.
and so we're seeing great wins with marquee brands. and what we're really seeing, mike, in my mind, is an increasing alignment with large employers and small, looking at the idea of platform to weave together everything that they do with an acknowledgment that the point solutions in the market are somewhat overwhelming for buyers to manage. our capacity to weave together that personalized healthcare platform, we think is boding really well for us today and will do even more for us tomorrow.
mike cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and you actually dovetailed nicely into what my follow-up question was going to be regarding that complexity you're seeing on the digital health benefits. obviously, accolade has historically been focused on your ecosystem partners, the trusted supplier, the terms that you use. as you think about a go-forward basis, how is that evolving in terms of parties that want to work with you versus parties that might want to go out on their own? and how does that factor into the value proposition that you're able to deliver in terms of the pitch forward for ongoing new customer wins?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
i'm going to take the first half of that question, mike, and i'm going to let shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, who really drives all our clinical partnerships take the second part of that question or speak to how we're selecting partners and working together. from our perspective, this is very much a customer-driven need. customers are coming to us and saying, ""what we want is a manicured set of partners that you can bring to bear, where you can warrant for us the engagement levels that will be driven, the clinical outcomes that will be driven and a sense of stability or capacity from a financial stability, security perspective, et cetera, on that particular vendor."" and so we're not seeing a lot of partners say, ""i want to do something separately."" in fact, the demand for partners into the platform is pretty high. shantanu, will you add a little around how we're thinking about partners moving forward?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer -- analyst
yes, absolutely. it's a great question. when we think about personalized healthcare, right, i mean the whole idea -- the third pillar around value base, that's really our north star, right? so i think as we think about the different categories we're looking at, what are the cost drivers, right, that employers are dealing with. we're thinking about what are the clinical outcomes that they're able to warrant.
we're also looking at that member experience. we know that's really critical and that's a huge challenge and top of mind for employers as they think more and more about the employee experience. and so that's really driving a lot of our partner selection decisions and allowing us to continually warrant better clinical outcomes.
mike cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from david grossman of stifel. your line is open.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. maybe i could just start with a quick financial question. i don't know if i did my math right, but it looks like the implied fourth quarter revenue guidance implies a pretty significant deceleration in year-over-year growth even if you add that $2.5 million of performance fees.
is my math right? or if not, if it is, can you provide some color on kind of what may be going on that may be impacting that comparison?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure, david. it's steve. thanks for the question. and absolutely, we'll walk you through how to think about that.
first of all, when you think about the first half of the year and like the performance we had, the solid execution, raising the guidance, we did pull forward that $2.5 million. we also, last quarter, pulled forward about $1 million. so if you take that pro forma growth rate and add that in, add that $3.5 million you get back up into the territory of where i think you would probably be expecting to see. that all said, one of the very important things we're doing here today is similar to where we were this time last year, unfortunately, given the delta variant, tight labor markets.
we are taking a measured approach to the full year, to the rest of the year. and given sometimes the lumpiness of the quarterly revenues and the bookings, we really do guide you to think about the full year growth rate. and when you look at it from that perspective, we're looking at a high 20s on a pro forma basis, call it, 28% growth rate, which gets you to that point we've talked about before, 25-ish percent for accolade, the legacy plushcare and 2nd.md business is growing on a plus 30 basis. but what you're seeing there, translating out for the fourth quarter, is that bit of our view to take a pragmatic approach while the markets are a bit volatile right now and that's where you see that guide coming in.
david grossman -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for that clarification. and maybe if i could just sidestep over to some of the conversation about accolade one. and i'm just curious, i know you only have a short window of experience in talking to customers about this product and sounds like you got a couple that are going to go into a pilot phase.
but as you're talking to them, how does this impact -- and when they talk to you about the product, how they view their traditional payer relationships because so much of what early offering is really a new and different way and disruptive way of delivering something very similar. so just curious if you have any feedback thus far.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
absolutely, david. one of the things that we're most excited about is that we're able to approach our customers with a value proposition that checks a lot of boxes that they've been thinking about for a number of years. when you think about accolade one, we're improving access to care. we're improving the affordability of care.
we're solving some health equity issues associated with that access to care issue in markets where it's been a profound problem for most of the customers that we serve. in all of those respects, david, i would say we're solving the problem in a brand-new way and not in a way that they perceive with the responsibility of their carrier, meaning they're looking for broader, more holistic solutions that weave together longitudinal relationships that then solve access to care problems on the front end and that solve clinical outcomes on the back end. that's a shift in the mentality of buyers moving away from transactional care, moving away from condition-focused care and moving to that longitudinal model. we think that more and more, those very same customers are coming to us and saying, ""what you're doing is giving me the capacity to deliver on the hypothesis of value-based care without changing the fundamental rails of the system i've already built my entire ecosystem on.
i don't have to change my carrier. i don't have to change my plan design. i don't have to change my network, and i can get all this value."" and so i might flip that on its head a little bit, david, and say, in fact, what we're really doing is enabling for our customers and their payer relationship the opportunity to let the status quo remain while delivering outcomes and results that materially improve the status quo.

our next question comes from rivka goldwasser of morgan stanley.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my question.
so i wanted to unpack a little bit more sort of some of the near-term trends you are seeing. so first, maybe if we can start, i think we've seen 32% year-over-year revenue growth on a pro forma basis. can you just give us the color on, of that 32%, what's the year-over-year growth for core versus the year-over-year that you've seen from the acquisitions. and then secondly, this can count as my follow-up question.
clearly, there are things that were better in the quarter, that trended better than you expected and hence, the upside. but then to your comment, you're seeing headwinds from deferral of surgeries. it's impacting second opinion. it sounds like potentially retention, at least in the near term in employers could be an issue.
so can you just help us kind of like unpack and maybe kind of like help bridge between and quantify on what the upside was? and then kind of like the offset. i think that would really help us as we think about our modeling not just for the second half of the year but also the comparisons into next year.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. ricky, it's steve. a couple of things. so when you look at the 32% pro forma growth rate, it's actually healthy across the three businesses.
you'll see in the q where we unpack that for accolade's core business. it's in the range of that 32% number, and for each of the 2nd.md and plushcare, it's in the 30% as well. so very strong performance that way across the board. meaning, when we reflect on those comments about membership and labor markets, it's really thinking prospectively, when we think about the second half and where we may see some impact of the variant and the labor markets.
now with respect to expert medical opinion, i will note that -- into that point, with some of those expert medical opinions are down a bit as we're seeing fewer elective procedures happening in parts of the country. so there's some there that you'll see the 2nd.md sequential quarter growth is fairly flat. on the flip side, virtual primary care visits, we saw be very strong through the plushcare direct-to-consumer platform. and as raj was just noting, the bullish view we have toward the opportunity with the enterprise around virtual primary care comes from that as well.
so interestingly, our diversification of it within the platform is showing up in the sense that the virtual primary care visits have been positive where there's been a bit of headwind on the expert medical opinion side at the moment for those reasons.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from ryan daniels of william blair. your line is open.
ryan daniels -- william blair -- analyst
yes. thank you for taking the questions. this is a little bit of a follow-up on an earlier one. but i'm curious as a lot of the point solutions appear to be coalescing around the navigation space and providers, i think it's driving a lot of m&a in the space.
i think we saw virgin today buy welltok and some other m&a activities. so i'm curious what you're seeing as you go to the sales pipeline on the competitive front, if that's changed a lot or if your acquisitions and continued innovation have really allowed you to stay ahead of the curve there.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, ryan. i do. we do fundamentally believe that this concept of personalized healthcare and the idea of personalized healthcare platforms that are built forward on human relationship, powered by data and everything that, that implies around artificial intelligence and machine learning and measurable around value-based outcomes, that, that is fundamentally differentiated and continue to be differentiated in the marketplace. the way we've always talked about this, and i know you might have heard this from us before, ryan, to break up the competition in multiple forms.
you mentioned welltok. there are those companies out there that are digital forward solutions really geared around driving digital only or highly digital engagement and there are a category of solutions like that, that traditionally drive lower engagement levels and aren't willing to warrant real cost savings on a population basis. there are also companies in the traditional navigation space who have focused on navigation as a whole, but not necessarily woven together some of the other components of the story around provider selection, around the virtual primary care and mental health and around things like downstream expert medical consultations. in those regards, we think we have an opportunity to materially improve the performance of the delivery of value-based care and savings and engagement levels.
there's also a category of competitors out there. as you mentioned, there's a wide variety of players in this space who are episodic in nature, who are looking at transactional care or looking at moments in time where consumers are entering the healthcare system and attempting what can help those consumers during those moments. we think those episodic solutions have value, but are unable to manage population health and long-term cost reduction on a population basis. and then finally, there's on-site near-site providers in the space who are also really, in our view, focused on those transactional moments where, without access to claims data, without access to the data set underneath that longitudinal journey, they're unable to provide the longitudinal care necessary.
and so summarizing all of that, ryan, the categories of competitors have certainly expanded. different companies are acknowledging the value of navigation, the value of a data set that we've spent 10, 12 years is accumulating and the value of longitudinal relationships. we're pleased with the idea that many of these concepts are ones that we've been talking about for the last 10 years and that we're building everything that we've acquired and built on our own on top of those principles.
ryan daniels -- william blair -- analyst
that's very helpful color. i appreciate that. and then maybe as a follow-up and taking a different twist on this, does it actually open up with your broader capabilities, new market potential for you? you mentioned near-site and on-site, we talked about value-based care and some of the providers taking on ma risk or provider groups entering into acos or commercial shared savings. as they take on that risk and evolve their models, they may look to someone like an accolade that can help them with engagement and second opinions and network management, kind of everything that you do for your core employer customers.
so do you see that as a market that could also open up for you longer term given the capability set and some of the needs that they have to stay competitive? thanks.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
yes. i think it's such a great question, ryan. and in part, because it really points to the fact that what we've really put together, both through our own innovation and the innovation of the companies that we've now made a part of the accolade family is a suite of capabilities that range from primary care to finding the best doctor using cost and quality data to consuming benefits data at scale so that we can make you aware of the benefits programs in your ecosystem, to being able to process millions of claims per day, per week so that we can understand where you are in your journey and understand what the financial impacts of all of these healthcare incursions are. each of those capabilities are interesting to our partners on a stand-alone basis.
and for some of our partners, they're interested in our offerings as a whole. what you've seen from us over the course of the last two or three years is we've gone from a company that really sold exclusively directly to employers to now a company that derives a material portion of our customer relationships from relationships with health plans and others who are looking to take advantage of those capabilities in a way that give a significant value to the remainder of the ecosystem they've assembled for their customers. so i'm not speaking specifically to the examples that you gave, ryan, but we built an architecture and a set of capabilities that allow us to be extremely partner-friendly with partners who share our value orientation and who share our desire to fix healthcare. and so that was a long-winded way of saying yes.
ryan daniels -- william blair -- analyst
i appreciate it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from richard close of canaccord genuity. your line is open.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yes. thanks for the questions. congratulations on the results. i appreciate the comments on being bullish on the virtual primary care.
i'm curious how you're thinking about the competitive environment in this subsegment. you said you were selling all of the products on a stand-alone. and i'm curious whether you're bumping into the likes of teladoc or any others and how these conversations are going with potential customers?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, and i appreciate you being here. let me give you a color on the competitive landscape. certainly, in the virtual primary care and mental health space, which is where we play with accolade care, we would be bumping into the competitors that you might expect who have staked a claim in either telemedicine, urgent care or in primary care in some way, shape or form. so that list of competitors is unlikely to be different than the one you might expect it to be.
where we differentiate in that respect is at our core, we've added to the capability to deliver primary care and mental health a set of capabilities underneath that, that you might more often equate or associate with navigation. we can help you understand what your benefits are and then actually prescribe those benefits, right from the doctor's visit. we can help you understand which physician you're supposed to see using data so that when we send you to that physician and we book that appointment for you, we know we're getting you to the best possible doctor. those capabilities, which previously have been under the cover or auspices of our navigation tools, are now also available in our accolade care offering.
that's fundamentally differentiated. and so to us, what we're really excited about is the pipeline is growing there. we've done our first couple of deals faster than we expected to, which has now happened twice. the same thing happened with expert medical opinion a quarter ago, is we're seeing demand from new prospects, and this is very exciting, we're seeing customers, particularly after our evolve conference just two weeks ago, raising their hand and saying they want to know more.
and their familiarity with our existing solutions and those existing navigation capabilities make the accolade care offering even more sensible to them. and so that pipeline continues to grow. and i think maybe to your point, those are a set of transactions or deals that we didn't get to play in, in 2020. so here we are in 2021.
that's a brand-new category, and we're excited about the fact that we're starting to see victories in that brand new category.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks. very helpful there. and i guess my follow-up, going back to one and the two companies that are going to pilot that. respect that you guys aren't announcing who those actual clients are.
but can you give us a little bit of a description of maybe like the scale of the companies or sort of any characteristics specific to them?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
absolutely. two parts to that story because there's two customers. one, we're unable to give you the exact name, but we can tell you it's a company that you would call in the fortune 500. a very large business that's leveraging the solution.
they're an existing customer who chose us, to be one of our vanguard accolade one customers. and really leveraging it, and this is maybe a little bit more color than we've previously provided, leveraging it not just for all the capabilities that we've talked about but leveraging it at its core as a part of an initiative within their business to address healthcare and equity. and that's something really exciting for us. this idea that our solutions can be at the pointy end of the spear for a company that has a corporate initiative around inequity and addressing inequity and healthcare and equity being right at the front of that for them was one of the drivers of them embracing accolade one.
the second customer i can actually name today because they've begun talking about it publicly. it's a company called metasource. and so it's a smaller company with, we call it, several thousand employees. smaller than this, obviously, this global 500, not a small company.
but what we try to do with the vanguard customers was pick one large customer and pick one midsized customer so that we could demonstrate this value with the different needs of customers of those sizes. what we're hearing in terms of interest from our customer base, though, is across the book. and so we see mid-market enterprise and strategic customers raise their hand to learn more about where we are.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you very much. that's very helpful. thanks.

our next question comes from jeff garro of piper sandler. your line is open.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. i want to ask about your channel partners. so two parts. the first is just if you could give any color on the contribution this selling season from channel partners.
and second part is looking forward, are channel partners excited about offering accolade one and accolade care and what kind of education is needed to really arm those partners for success there?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, jeff. great to talk. we are seeing continued traction. so when you talk about partners, there are multiple varieties of partners that we work with.
we certainly work with plans who are offering our solutions to their customers. we also work with brokers and consultants who are recommending us to their clients and/or working with us to educate their teams on the value proposition that we deliver. our health plan channel continues to strengthen. we continue to see value in working with plans to accentuate or drive value to their solutions by leveraging our engagement and clinical capabilities, and we expect that part of our business to continue to grow over time.
i think the core of your question, jeff, is, are those health plans or other partners, finding value in accolade one and on accolade care. and what we can tell you definitively is the need from our partner community to find virtual forward healthcare solutions that address things like access and affordability of care alongside longitudinal care journeys is very, very real. and so absolutely, the interest in that partner channel has expanded in part because we've got a brand new value proposition that we can deliver to them with expert medical opinion and virtual primary care and mental health, those are conversations we could not have with many of our plan partners and other partners in just six or nine months ago. those conversations have opened up brand-new paths for us to add value, and we're excited about where they might lead.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
excellent. that helps. and my follow-up, to switch gears a little bit. it's been another interesting year in terms of healthcare utilization.
so i'm just curious where visibility is toward achieving performance fees related to the calendar '21 period that will impact your fiscal fourth quarter at this point in the year and how that's been factored into the guidance.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. so jeff, a quick reminder for everybody that for our total health and benefits customers, that point of, call it, 10% or so of the pepm fees is savings-based and you've got another 20% on performance-based guarantees. performance-based -- operational pgs are things like clinical outcomes, engagement rates, customer satisfaction. we're typically measuring those as the year goes along.
and for savings, you measure that typically on a calendar year. contract year typically goes january through december. i would say this, we've got about six months or so of data here halfway through the year. claims data lags by a couple of months.
so we're looking at six or seven months of data. what we're doing in our guidance there, jeff, is factoring in -- taking a really pragmatic approach again to the end of the year, knowing we've got a track record of earning 95% of the whole pepm fee, typically in high spend and low spend environments. mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's a bit unusual with healthcare spending going on right now in the world. so we are going to just factor that in with a bit of a measured approach to the year.
and again, a similar approach to what we would have taken this time last year.

our next question comes from ryan macdonald with needham. your line is open.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. raj, maybe first one for you. obviously, you're servicing a lot of inbound demand right now for the new products and the rebrand. but given how much the portfolio of offerings has evolved over the past 12 months, as you start to think about next year and proactively going out to market and you're getting past that inbound demand servicing, how are you educating or structuring the sales organization in terms of what they'll be leading with, with this greatly expanded use cases.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
that's a great question, ryan. thank you for being here. first of all, i think the first important element for us was an acknowledgment that by virtue of the expanded capabilities of the company, it was imperative that we redefine not just who we are, but what we think the industry is demanding and therefore, what we're responding to. that's personalized healthcare.
and the idea of personalized healthcare is we believe all of our solutions fall into that umbrella. that umbrella of human forward, whether you're buying our advocacy solutions, our expert medical solutions or our care solutions, you're going to find that we're going to deliver you a human relationship. we're going to power it with data. so we're going to be very smart about leveraging the underpinning data assets that we've been building for the last 12 years to guide our actions.
and all of it is going to be built around this value measurable orientation. everything we do, whether that's performance guarantees, incentives or fees at risk, put us in alignment with the customer, which as all three of those things, we think, are fairly unique in the industry, and so all of our solutions are built around that idea. the reason that's important, ryan, is we've been talking about this since we've been public, our mission is to meet the customer where they want to be met. and an acknowledgment that some customers are looking at access to care issues or looking at primary care deserts and thinking this is the problem i have to solve.
and for those customers, our teams are going to be really smart about positioning accolade care as the right solution for them. others are looking at solving other problems around more acute conditions, cancer treatments, etc., those might be customers looking at expert medical opinion. and of course, we've been leading the advocacy or navigation space for the last 10 years. and we expect to continue to participate in all the rfps and all the evaluations that are happening in that space and really in many respects to be creating those.
and so we're not fundamentally restructuring the sales organization in any way, shape or form, ryan. we've got a sales team that's focused on plans. we've got a team focused on mid-market, on the enterprise segment and the strategic segment. what we've done is really giving them more tools in their bag, so that as they understand the customers, which is what they're really trained to do, discover what the customers' pain points are, that they have in our view, the biggest bag or the largest -- or the greatest breadth of potential offerings for those customers to solve their problems with that orientation around those first three values that i talked about.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
very helpful. and then just a quick follow-up. the healthreveal acquisition, the technology there looks pretty unique and differentiated. i'd just love to know a little bit more about how that functionality can expand upon what you've got with the true health engine already.
thanks.
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer -- analyst
yes. that's a fantastic question. this is shantanu nundy. we're super excited about this.
as you alluded to, core accolade has been our best action capability, right? so this idea of using all the data that we have, translating them to insights and putting that right into our workflow so that our frontline care teams can guide members on what's the clinically most impactful next step for them. what healthreveal does, what they figured out is really how to deliver a much deeper set of clinical insights using not only claims data and some of the data that's actively historically it's had also electronic health record data. and so for us, this was a capability that was on our road map. and for us, we really think of this as a huge accelerator to be able to, again, bring a lot more of those evidence-based clinical insights to our physicians and also to the rest of our frontline care team, which we think aligns really well with personalized healthcare, the full second pillar around being data-driven.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks again.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from stephanie davis of svb leerink. your line is open.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions guys. i want to continue on an earlier thought. if we want to roll forward the idea that care navigation is becoming table stakes, and it's a bit more commonplace in general for some of these digital platforms to have a care navigation play inside of it. have you ever thought of taking advantage of that trend, selling an instance of your platform and gaining a new revenue stream as a navigation as a service infrastructure play? or is that just too out of the box?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
first of all, stephanie, great to talk to you again. thanks for being here. i think when we talk about navigation and any time we put an umbrella term on a set of capabilities, it's imperative that we kind of break that down and speak to what those capabilities are. a number of companies, yes, are out there speaking about the fact that they deliver navigation today.
we would say the number of companies who have accumulated the claims, rx, insurance information and interaction data as well as clinical data associated with medical -- electronic medical record data as the underpinning of the platform to be able to navigate through benefits, navigate through claims, drive people to the best position, et cetera. i mean, all the things that we've been doing for the last 10 years is still a very, very, very small number of companies. a lot of people use the word navigation. not a lot of people actually deliver navigation.
that would be point number one. point number two would be i think you're absolutely on to an idea that speaks to the point -- i think it was ryan's question earlier. we've architected our solution around the idea of delivering capabilities. now we weave those capabilities into offerings.
those capabilities are available to our partners. now who would we partner with around those capabilities? the way we've always thought about it, stephanie, is we'll partner with people who share our mission, who are aligned in our vision around improving healthcare for the people that they serve and who are aligned in our belief in the idea of personalized healthcare. and so i don't know what that means in terms of potential partnerships with navigation vendors down the road but i can tell you, we believe that our capabilities architecture is unique in the industry and gives us an opportunity to be a really productive partner for many.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from david larsen of btig. your line is open.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
hi. congratulations on a good quarter. with regards to accolade one and accolade care, it seems to me like even though the clients you have might be charged a slightly higher pepm rate, the overall cost of healthcare for them would actually decline more given that you'd have a more comprehensive solution. just any thoughts or color around that? and can you put any numbers around that, like the incremental percent savings that they might be able to realize?
raj singh -- chief executive officer
hi. thanks for the question, david. and absolutely, we believe and a core to the value proposition of accolade one that we're taking to our vanguard customers and then to the customers beyond it, is the idea that when we move together all of these incremental values, things above and beyond the advocacy solutions that both of those customers have purchased from us in the past, that we'll improve clinical outcomes and that we will continue to lower costs above and beyond where we are today. the amount of cost that will improve on a year-over-year basis based on those incremental services is going to vary by the population that we serve and the makeup of that population, just as it does if you were to buy a core navigation service today.
and so it might be too early for us to speak to those incremental savings. what we can say is we feel so confident in those incremental savings that, as steve mentioned earlier, our revenue model creates the opportunity to take a little more risk while adding upside to the opportunity that we think is really material and could be really high-value, high-margin revenue.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one more quick one. with the delta variant, it sounds to me like the impact there was with 2nd.md, some delays in elective procedures.
can you confirm that 2nd.md revenue still grew by at least 30% year over year in the quarter, and that there wasn't really any other drag that you saw from the delta variant in terms of like the sales cycle? and then it also sounds to me like the delta variant will become an easier comp or a tailwind in fiscal '23. just any thoughts there would be helpful. thank you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hi david, nice to talk to you. yes, i can confirm with 2nd.md, year-over-year growth rate is in that just north of 30% range. on sales cycle, we're going to come back to you all at the end of the next quarter, and we'll give you a sense of how that's coming through. but for 2nd.md, for sure, that 30% year-over-year growth was achieved.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from aris long with berenger. your line is open.
unknown speaker -- berenger bank -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so just one on accolade one. because it's a value-based care model that's quite new in the employers' benefits market.
i'm wondering, should we expect slightly a longer sales cycle. i'm also curious how much education needs to be done so that employers are comfortable with the value-based model and also a higher upfront pepm fee.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you. it's a great question. i appreciate the opportunity to talk a little bit more about accolade one.
when you think about accolade one, the first thing i think, and steve mentioned this earlier in his remarks, and i think it's imperative that we point out. when we talk about a value-based model, what we're not talking about here is as a medicare advantage sub-capitated risk model like some other companies are out in the industry talking about. in fact, self-insured employers have rarely been given an opportunity to participate in a model that will warrant clinical outcomes, warrant cost reduction while improving employee satisfaction. when we think about this value-based model, what we're essentially going to the customer with is a brand-new set of capabilities or a brand-new offering that they haven't been approached with in the past that speaks to all of those vectors.
the reality is self-insured employers today are very rarely being approached with numbers associated with clinical improvement, with numbers associated with cost reduction and measurable value while at the same time, improving satisfaction of employees. that said, i mentioned in my prepared remarks that you're absolutely right. we think that the preponderance of the interest in accolade one is really going to be in our existing customer base. customers who have taken advantage of navigation, expert medical opinion for accolade care in the past and who built off of that trusted relationship and the data set that drives the measurability of the healthcare we've delivered for them will be very interested in upgrading or moving forward to a broader accolade one solution.
and so in a way, that implies a longer sales cycle, which i think is a little bit different and maybe i might paint that picture a little bit differently, but i think it gets to the same outcome.
unknown speaker -- berenger bank -- analyst

our next question comes from vikram kesavabhotla of baird. your line is open.
vikram kesavabhotla -- baird -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. just one quick point of clarification on healthreveal. i was just curious, did that contribute at all to the second quarter on revenue or ebitda? and is there any impact from that contemplated in the fiscal '22 guide? and just anything there around the financial profile, if there's something to note.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. vikram, thanks for being here. first of all, the acquisition just closed, so it's post second quarter. and there's not really any revenue to speak of there.
it's really about the intellectual property and the team that we acquired and the value that's contributing that shantanu spoke about earlier, along with raj's existing remarks. and with the team that's coming over, we're factoring that in as part of our guidance in fiscal '22 from a spend perspective.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to rajeev singh for any closing remarks.

please go ahead.
todd friedman -- senior vice president of investor relations
thanks, gigi. welcome, everyone, to our fiscal second-quarter earnings call. with me on the call today are our chief executive officer, rajeev singh; and our chief financial officer, steve barnes. shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join for the question-and-answer portion of the call later.
before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating accolade's performance. details on the relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results for accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call.
for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. and with that, i will turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh. raj? 
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and thank you to everyone for joining us. the second quarter was another strong quarter in our continuing growth and expansion as accolade reinvents the healthcare market. revenue and adjusted ebitda were both ahead of guidance, and we added many new marquee customers across all of our solutions and segments. and we demonstrated the accelerated integration of our acquired companies with the launch of two new solutions.
steve will give you more details on our financial results a little bit later in the call. i want to spend some time today discussing our new solutions and the continued evolution of our strategy and the growth of our target addressable market. before i do, let me review some highlights of our execution since last quarter. the demand environment for our solutions remains strong, and we added new customers across all market segments and in new sales, upgrades and cross-sells.
we added new customers and signed upgrades this quarter with well-known companies like tory burch and artisan partners as well as a global financial services brand and a global hospitality brand, to name a few. and our health plan partners also continue to add to our customer base. we also signed our first customers for accolade care, the primary care and mental health solution we announced at evolve in september. given that we only announced this new offering last month, we're clearly pleased with our progress, and our pipeline continued to expand.
we're also excited to announce that we have two existing customers committed to be the vanguard customers for our new accolade one solution. since our ipo just a year ago, we've expanded our addressable market by 10x to more than $200 billion. that is manifesting in new opportunities for our business and represented by a growing pipeline across every market segment in these new categories. two weeks ago, we challenged the healthcare industry at our annual customer event, evolve21.
we told our customers, our partners and the industry that it was time to move forward. that simply applying new technologies to tired old business models only serve to perpetuate the inefficiencies of a healthcare industry that now makes up nearly 20% of gdp and deliver subpar outcomes at rising costs for employers. our challenge included introducing a whole new category called personalized healthcare designed to deliver against the quadruple aim, better patient experience, improving health outcomes, giving physicians the tools they need to serve their patients and lowering healthcare costs. and we announced two new solutions that specifically answer the call for personalized healthcare.
these new solutions, accolade care and accolade one, bring together the capabilities of advocacy, expert medical consoles and primary care and mental health. employers of all sizes recognize that a positive healthcare experience is critical to delivering a superior employee experience. you're seeing this play out in loud voices across the country as millions of people leave their jobs, seeking something that works better for them. sometimes, that's a shorter commute.
sometimes it's a better boss. but more than half of all people who leave their jobs today cite a poor healthcare experience as one of the main reasons they quit. this isn't just about cost reduction. it's about employee engagement in an era where employee engagement is a strategic imperative.
employers need a better way. i'd like to spend a minute now briefly outlining the category of personalized healthcare and then tell you more about accolade care and accolade one. for starters, there are three key attributes for any offering in personalized healthcare. first, it's personal.
we have to put the humanity back into healthcare. we hold the view that having a long-lasting personal relationship matters. too many have tried to replace people with technology inappropriately. innovation and technology are good, and they can make the experience better, but nothing can replace the human experiences in healthcare.
two or second, it is data-driven. we must harness the power of data to make healthcare better, to make smart recommendations, to build personalized health plans, to equip physicians with the most current clinical guidance. machine learning and ai should be leveraged to make the experience more personal, not less. and lastly, it is value-based.
it's time to replace fee-for-service healthcare with value-based care. it's time that we measure quality, outcomes and satisfaction like we do in every other industry. every accolade solution is built on these core tenets, and these beliefs are foundational to who we are as a company and who we've always been. with the introduction of accolade one and accolade care, we now offer three different sets of solutions to our customers.
first, advocacy solutions that we've been leading the market in for more than 10 years; second, expert medical opinion solutions like accolade expert md, formerly known as 2nd.md; and third, our new care solutions, accolade care and accolade one. this set of solutions unique in their breadth allow us to meet customers with where they'd like to be met and serve the need most important to them in the current time. all of these solutions are built on a next-generation technology stack that allows us to seamlessly weave capabilities across all of the offerings. accordingly, capabilities like a true health engine and action plan, which provides the ability to process volumes of healthcare data determine the next best action for one of our members can be blended with intelligent provider matching, which matches a physician to a member based on cost and quality information.
or with benefits plan management the ability to ingest benefits plan documents at scale and translate them into plain english. every solution capability can be delivered via any of our core offerings. this nimble technology architecture, coupled with our market-leading data set and ai capabilities, make all of our individual solutions uniquely powerful. when we choose to develop or acquire new technologies, like the healthreveal capabilities mentioned in our press release that will strengthen our true health action plans, our technology diligence is critical to ensuring that new capabilities will work and scale within our architecture.
we are building an operating system for the delivery of healthcare at scale, and we believe this is a long-term competitive moat for our company. now let's talk about these solutions that we're so excited about. accolade care represents a leap past the last generation or generation of one of the telemedicine solutions on the market. this virtual primary care and mental health solution is unique because it not only blends primary care and mental health via a unique collaborative care model.
it also incorporates the capabilities of accolade's advocacy solutions, things like driving benefit solutions adoption, intelligent provider matching and care coordination. we expect accolade care to be a solution that's appealing to both new prospects in every market segment and a cross-sell opportunity for our existing customers. accolade care is available now, and as noted earlier, already has its first customers. pricing for the solution is on a pepm basis plus visit fees with performance guarantees consistent with our contracts in the past.
accolade one is our most comprehensive offering, delivering an integrated value-based model to employers that includes a combination of nearly all of accolade's capabilities including a number of new innovations that are either available today or in development and demonstrated at evolve. we expect accolade one to be a significant upsell opportunity for customers that are already taking advantage of some of our solutions. while we will certainly present the solution to new prospects, we expect most prospects to choose to start with one of our core offerings before expanding their relationship with us. pricing for the solution will be built off of our existing relationships and include value-based gain sharing as we deliver incremental savings and improved clinical outcomes.
it will be generally available next year, and we'd expect revenue contribution in our fiscal 2024. at evolve, we also announced a rebrand for accolade expert md, which previously sold as 2nd.md and accolade advocacy, our total health and benefits, total care and total benefit solutions. the rebrand highlights the evolution of our offerings to include more capabilities and bring together the acquisitions into a more unified portfolio. accolade advocacy, as always, will still be sold in tiers, and that bundling will continue under the[audio gap]one last note on evolve21.
it was an inspiring event. we were able to showcase both our customers and our partners as well as introducing our customers to our new integrated leadership team. partners like virta, rx savings, sword, carrot and ginger presented and a great list of customers also presented on their accolade experience. lastly, before i turn the call to steve, i want to touch on one other piece of news in our today's press release about our acquisition of materially all the assets of healthreveal.
healthreveal's capabilities address one of the most critical gaps in care delivery today, which is trying to ensure that all physicians are working with the most current evidence-based guidelines when recommending courses of treatment for their patients. today, that is a highly manual process, largely done through print guidelines or hard to access online libraries. when delivered via accolade's true health action plans, healthreveal's recommendations will help ensure our primary care physicians are operating according to the most up-to-date evidence-based guidelines, reinforcing our commitment to high-quality personalized healthcare at scale. with this acquisition, we gained competitively differentiated ip and an extraordinarily talented team that we're pleased to welcome to accolade.
while this is very modestly sized acquisition, it's a good time to refresh on our core principles of m&a, innovation and partnership. we're building a virtual forward personalized healthcare platform, so members always get the care they need when they need it. our innovation engine continues to be a primary source of new capabilities, and we will continue to fund that engine. our partnership engine is aligned to integrate partners who share our value orientation, are interested in meaningful integration and are committed to improving clinical outcomes in chronic conditions or specialty areas.
our m&a focus is on virtual forward solutions that either materially improve our current capabilities or add new capabilities that impact the broad populations we serve. all of that is underpinned by a disciplined approach regarding valuation and p&l profile that are the foundation of our commitment to our shareholders. with that, i will now turn the call over to steve barnes, our chief financial officer, to discuss our results and forward-looking guidance. steve?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thank you, raj. first, i'll recap the results for the second quarter of fiscal '22. keep in mind that we closed the 2nd.md acquisition in q1 and the plushcare acquisition in early q2. where appropriate, i'll provide color on the year-over-year comparisons beyond the tables in the press release, and you will find additional pro forma detail in the 10-q.
first, we generated $73.3 million in revenue in the second fiscal quarter, representing approximately 100% year-over-year growth on a gaap basis over the prior year period and a $2.3 million beat against the top end of our guidance range. in our 10-q, we provide pro forma results for the combined businesses that showed 32% q2 growth year-over-year. as we provide pro forma results per sec requirements for the rest of the fiscal year, keep in mind that we are selling our solutions both together and separately. so while the reported pro forma revenue growth and profitability numbers are intended to reflect the acquisitions as a stand-alone, it may not always be a perfect representation of how we sell to customers and run the business overall.
the revenue outperformance relative to guidance was largely attributable to solid execution on multiple fronts, including favorable customer member counts and positive contributions from plushcare's direct-to-consumer business, both of which benefited adjusted ebitda. i'll also note that plushcare achieved a significant milestone this past quarter, having crossed the threshold of 100,000 subscribers on the direct-to-consumer platform in just two years after launching the subscription element of that offering. we are bullish on the growth opportunity of our virtual primary care business, both via the direct-to-consumer model and to enterprises via accolade care and accolade one. fiscal q2 adjusted gross margin of 40.9% compared to 43.3% in the prior year period, reflecting investments in staffing our frontline care teams to support growth and integration.
as stated in prior earnings calls, we expect adjusted gross margin to remain relatively flat on a full-year basis compared to fiscal 2021. adjusted ebitda in the second quarter of fiscal '22 outperformed guidance with a loss of $19.4 million, which compares to $8.7 million in the prior year second fiscal quarter. turning to the balance sheet. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of fiscal second quarter totaled $384 million.
note that during the quarter, we paid approximately $34 million net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments related to the plushcare acquisition. finally, we had approximately 66.3 million shares of common stock outstanding as of august 31, 2021. this does not include approximately 3.6 million shares to be issued in calendar '22 related to the 2nd.md and plushcare earnouts. and now turning to guidance.
for the fiscal third quarter ending november 30, 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $74.5 million to $76.5 million and adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $21.5 million to $24.5 million. as noted in the press release, revenue guidance for fiscal q3 includes approximately $2.5 million from performance guarantees that have been earned and we expect to recognize in fiscal q3 rather than fiscal q4. and for the fiscal year ending february 28, 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $303 million to $307 million, representing approximately 79% growth over the prior year at the midpoint. we are reiterating adjusted ebitda loss for fiscal '22, which is expected to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million, representing an adjusted ebitda loss of approximately negative 17% of revenues at the midpoint.
and before we open up the call for your questions, i'd like to address some of the top items we've been getting from investors over the past few weeks. first, i'll provide some color about the macro environment, particularly around the labor market and the delta variant impact, and then i'll talk a bit about the financial model for our new solutions that raj mentioned. i'll start with a broad remark about accolade's business. we have never felt better about our company, our solutions, our people, our customers and our market opportunity.
coming off of evolve, we are hearing feedback from customers that not only validates the personalized healthcare category, but tells us that our relationships are going to progress in a significant and positive way over the coming years. we'll continue to invest against that opportunity, balanced with financial discipline as we've consistently said. and with all of that said, we see the same things that you do in the macro environment. the labor market is tight in many areas, and the delta variant is still creating an unusual healthcare spending environment.
we've seen virtual care continue to grow as people avoid doctors' offices and become more accustomed to virtual care but we've also seen pressure on second opinion volumes as people defer elective procedures. as you can see from our guidance, we raised our top line to reflect the q2 outperformance. but much as we did last year in the early days of the pandemic, we will continue to take a measured approach to our outlook through the end of the year. now with respect to our new offerings, accolade one and accolade care, we'd like to outline some key points on our revenue and pricing models.
raj addressed the pricing models for these solutions, and i'd like to give you some quick model color. first, in our view, there is no need for changes to models at this time. from a timing perspective, we have initial pilot customers for accolade one and we'll be marketing accolade one and accolade care as part of our portfolio during calendar year 2022 for what we'd expect to be january 1, 2023 launches. so we expect no impact to the current fiscal year and a relatively small financial impact in fiscal '23 and then growing in fiscal '24 albeit still relatively small compared to the full accolade business and our core advocacy solutions.
we expect over time that as we drive this incremental value, we will earn more revenue per customer and contribute to our goals of gross margin expansion. and second, we reiterate our expectations for the long-term operating metrics that we've outlined previously, particularly revenue growth in the 25% range, gross margins greater than 50%, and long-term operating margins as measured by adjusted ebitda in the 15% to 20% range. on pricing, accolade care will consist of pepm revenues and visit fees from virtual primary care visits, mental health support and some advocacy services and include performance guarantees. accolade one will go a step further, employing a value-based care model that will include upside elements to our revenue that will allow us to share in the benefits of improved outcomes and incremental savings that we expect to drive for our customers.
this is consistent with our history of putting a portion of our fees at risk. as you know, our current contracts for accolade advocacy generally include about 10% of fees at risk for cost savings and an additional 20% at risk for the achievement of various value drivers such as member engagement levels and satisfaction. we've consistently demonstrated success in these measures, having historically earned more than 95% of that total pepm fee opportunity in our advocacy offerings and through third-party validations of our cost savings, including two in-depth studies by aon. we have strong conviction based on our past success that weaving together primary care, mental health support, expert medical opinion and other clinical programs will enable us to drive materially higher cost savings for customers via accolade one.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to raj.
raj singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve. i'm going to close the call by thanking our newly formed team. six months ago, we were three completely separate businesses executing against different strategies and different objectives. to this team come together so quickly and deliver a three-day customer event, speaking as a single team with integrated solutions and a single voice validated not only the strategy behind the acquisitions, but more importantly, validated our judgment about the quality of the people across these organizations.thank you to the team.

yeah, guys. congrats on the strong quarter. thanks for taking the question. steve, maybe one for you.
you highlighted just the traction you're seeing in organizations selecting multiple offerings and that laying the foundation for accolade one and accolade care. so i'm hoping you could dive a little bit more into the pipeline and outlook there and maybe even tie into that some of the recent executive hires. i think you added your first customer success officer and chief customer officer. so i'd love to hear how that ties into the growth story as well.

ryan, we're excited about the growth profile of the company and the continued demand in each of the market segments that we're performing in. and so you'll recall, three or four years ago, the company made its choice to expand into the middle market where we're seeing continued growth, both from a logo expansion perspective and from an acv perspective. the enterprise segment, same story. and so you're exactly right.
we've actually invested in a chief customer officer by the name of eve stacey, who we think is going to do amazing things in helping us scale the services that have delivered really outstanding customer satisfaction levels over the last 10 years to the next level as we go to -- from a couple of hundred customers to 600 to more than 1,000 soon. and then, of course, as well, we added a chief marketing officer, carolina lobo, who joined [inaudible] rich history of, i mean, in the healthcare industry, helping us build out and grow our expansion plans across every one of those segments. and so the really positive news in our mind, ryan, is that the space itself is continuing to show growth and that customers are embracing this expanded value proposition of personalized healthcare. and that's yielding acv growth that steve just talked about and the growth of the team that you mentioned in your question.

thank you. our next question comes from glen santangelo with jefferies. you may proceed with your questions.
glen santangelo -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. thanks. steve, i just want to follow up on some of the ebitda comments. i just want to make sure that i'm doing the math right.
if i kind of play your numbers through your guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like you're sort of modeling ebitda for the full year to be a loss of somewhere in the high 40s, maybe around $49 million. and then if i use your guidance and the percentages you provided for fiscal '23, using the midpoints, it looks like we're -- you're expecting about $44 million, $45 million in the ebitda loss. so a little bit better. but, you know, as you think about the path to profitability, it certainly looks better on a percentage basis than an absolute basis.
i'm just trying to make sure that i'm looking at all those numbers correctly. thanks.Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the question, glen. and i think fair to say you're spot on. for this year, fiscal '22, you can think of that -- the midpoint of that ebitda range for this year is $50 million on the $306 million to $309 million revenue number we gave.
and then for next year, about $44 million, that's a good number to be. we're -- it's early yet as far as the guide for next year's preliminary guidance. but think of it in that mid-40s range and the improvement in absolute dollars but also on a percentage of revenue basis as we're growing the business top line 25% year over year, we think, is very healthy. and then importantly, laying out that multiyear period all the way out to breakeven in fiscal '25 as we make that steady step-down toward breakeven was very important to us in the longer-term guide.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from craig hettenbach with morgan stanley.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thanks so much. and i appreciate the transparency about the customer that you're walking away from and implications on the business in terms of lower margin. can you maybe just touch on, at the same time, you're talking about rapidly expanding and growing tam and the opportunity set.
and just maybe weaving those two things together, like the ability to kind of be more disciplined because there's a lot of growth opportunity in front of you and how you're managing the business in terms of growth versus margins as we go forward.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question, craig. thank you for the question. thank you for being here today. the transparency provided as it related to the customer that we decided to move on from is really built around this idea that we had started serving that customer, call it, five years ago in really serving exchange population on behalf of that customer.
and over time, we began to realize that it was a noncore platform, not an area that we were going to spend an extraordinary amount of time growing. and it was operating on a platform where we didn't believe that was our core platform. and so i think the decision to move forward is really one of -- we're targeting all of our investment on our core platform. we're targeting all of that investment around innovation that we think appeals to employers and to the tricare business that we're so excited about.
and that in that business, we can not only deliver outsized innovation, incredible engagement rates, and clinical outcomes, but we'll also see the kind of margin expansion that steve outlined over the course of the next several years. so you're exactly right. two are very correlated. this is about the discipline of our investment, the discipline of our execution, and the discipline toward our asset profitability.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael cherny with bank of america. you may proceed with your question.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. congratulations on the nice results. i want to ask one clarification question and one bigger picture question. i'm going to squeeze them both in, in case i get cut off after.
just i want to make sure, relative, steve, to the $9 million you mentioned that you walked away from, assuming -- i mean that is basically not in the baseline for next year versus this year. so you can assume the growth rate would have been closer to the high 20s. in the event that that's the case, i just want to confirm that. and then, raj, i want to dive a little bit into some of the early feedback you're receiving from the customers that chose to select some of your new platforms.
obviously, i know for anyone that went live on one. we're not going to actually know how it's going. but as you're going through that launch period, and especially implementing newer solutions, newer go-to-market platforms, what were some of the learnings you took out? and what were some of the pieces that your customers really want to make sure that you got to the finish line that you are able to deliver for them?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, mike, and i appreciate you being here. i'll -- let me take the second question first and let steve answer your first question right after that. immediately upon bringing new solutions to the marketplace with our customers, we saw traction. obviously, with expert medical opinion, we outlined that.
and as statistically laid out in the call, we saw 20 customers buy both advocacy and emo together or accolade expert md together. we also saw another 20 or so buy emo on top of accolade advocacy. here's what every one of those customers said, and i think it's the same thing that we're hearing from customers on accolade care. they're not interested in district products that deliver different value propositions.
what they're interested in is integrated engagement hub that drives value for everything that connects to it. and very clearly, they expect that the things that are coming from accolade should drive an outsized engagement level than what they would have seen from other vendors potentially. and so that expectation is starting to manifest in actual reality in terms of statistics we're seeing from customers around engagement rates. so that's part one.
customers don't just want multiple solutions for the same vendor. they want integrated solutions built up the same technology platform and with a [inaudible] engagement statistics and value. then i think point two of that story is that has to manifest in integrated care teams as well. and so when we're talking about delivering value, we're talking about the capacity that seamlessly transfer from our frontline care teams to our primary care physicians and to our expert medical opinion capabilities without having to lead the interaction, without having to lead the software interface.
and we think that's a really important part of what customers want and/or ask for. steve, do you want to take part two -- or part one of that question?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure, absolutely. so mike, the clarification there on that $9 million, you're correct. that contract, we let that go at the end of december calendar year, 12/31. so that's $9 million impact.
think of it as about a 3% headwind on growth rate in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal '22, $9 million on that 307.5 midpoint.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jailendra singh with credit suisse. you may proceed with your question.Â 
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on a good quarter. just following up on fiscal '23 outlook. thanks for all the color there and a good clarification there from michael. on the 2nd.md expectations, now you're expecting 20% growth versus 30% plus what the business has seen in the past.
maybe remind us again how that business is split between like pepm and case rate. and what your underlying assumptions are with respect to electives as we are seeing the trends now? are you expecting trends to stay at the same level or get worse? and kind of related on the margin improvement you expect in fiscal '23, is that all operational leverage or you're expecting some improvement in these recent acquisitions? if i can just one related part, i can ask. if electives do recover in fiscal '23, do you -- driving some upside to your fiscal '23 revenue, would that have any impact on margins in fiscal '23?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey! hi, jailendra, it's steve. and yes, i'll get that one. and so you hit a few things there. let's start though with the trends as far as volume.
jaile, you heard us talk about 200 added customers on 400-or-so customers taken together post the acquisition. so we've had significant growth in customers. many of those are buying expert medical opinion either on stand-alone or together as a suite with advocacy. that's very important to us.
we're hearing over and over again from the market that customers highly value it, particularly when it's tied to the accolade engagement engine. so we're very bullish on the category overall and the opportunity to weave them together. the volumes, yes, we're seeing procedures down for sure. you'll see a roughly flat quarter-to-quarter growth from q2 to q3.
what you're seeing in the guide from us is and assume -- assumption that those utilization rates stay about where they are for now until we have better visibility into the future. so certainly, if those procedures pick up and there's more elective medical opinions, there would be some upside there. and then as far as the fiscal '23 guide goes, there is operating leverage on the opex for sure, but we're also forecasting that gross margins will begin to expand again. year over year, this year, fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21, we've been consistent in guiding to about flat gross margins.
we expect to see gross margin tick up next year in fiscal '23 and again in '24 and '25 on that march to breakeven. so it's a combination of both gross margin expansion with all the offerings taken together and operating leverage.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff garro with piper sandler. you may proceed with your question.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, guys. congrats on the quarter. i want to ask a couple around performance guarantee trends.
so the first one is whether the pull forward of performance guarantees so far in the fiscal year reduces potential volatility, i think mostly to the upside for your fiscal fourth quarter. and then just more broadly, is customer interest in performance guarantees as part of contracts increasing given your integrated offerings? and how would you expect that to layer into the portfolio over time?Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks for the question, jeff. it's steve. so let me hit that -- well, i'll start with the first part. on the pull forward and the earlier recognition of pgs, you're absolutely right.
it does reduce some volatility in the fourth quarter for us. i made a point in my prepared remarks to say this is a good thing. when we give guidance, we are -- it's very important to us that the investment community understands we're giving full year guidance. and then as we achieve pgs, if we achieve them throughout the year, we book them as they're earned, and that's a good thing because it takes some volatility away from the fourth quarter.
so perhaps that takes away some upside and some downside from the fourth quarter in doing so. again, that's, we think, a very positive trend. and then to your point about customers, over and again, it's very important that customers understand that there's an roi associated with the work that we're doing and the value that we're providing. and the fact that we have shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, on the line who's spending a lot of time with customers and the clinical capabilities that we've been adding, let me kick it over to him for a second because he's had some real recent interactions with customers on this front.
shantanu, you want to take it from here?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, sure. absolutely. and i think it's a great part of your question around the customer interest in pgs and clinical pgs in particular. and i think it's definitely a core part of our hypothesis.
you know, it's going back to the whole idea of personalized healthcare being personal, data-driven, and value-based. what we're seeing in market is that, you know, customers are really interested in how we're measuring our outcomes, and there's a lot of interest in those performance guarantees. and it's something that we think is going to be really hard for others to be able to replicate. you know, actually showing that we can deliver on those clinical outcomes is something that we've done in the past.
and i think that the customer interest in those, i think it's a really good sign that the core thesis behind personalized healthcare is ripe.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david larsen with btig. you may proceed with your question.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
hi. if a health plan were to come to you and say, hey, we want you to bear full risk for this cohort of lives for x dollars per member per month, is that something you'd be able to do? or is that a track that you might sort of beyond to do longer term? and then just any thoughts around in-person care with plush virtual is great. but i mean a lot of times, you need to draw blood. you have to have an in-person diagnostic piece to virtual care.
how are you addressing that? thanks very much.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yeah, david. thanks for the question. i appreciate you being here. i'm going to take the second part of that question to shantanu, our chief medical officer, to talk a little bit about how we believe virtual care can coordinate and collaborate with brick-and-mortar care, as well as a way to think about that in terms of the way we deliver services to our customers.
on the first topic, the way we're working most prevalently with health plans today is approaching their commercial populations with our service, either in tandem with other components of their clinical services or directly with our service in its entirety being a carve off for some of their member services and clinical services functions. we do that in both the reseller and a referral model and it's very complementary to our direct sales model. the question you're asking around would we be willing to take full financial risk in a carve-out segment of their population, think it's not something that you should model into, our business into what we're looking at for next year or even really for this year or next year, david. it's certainly something that we'll evaluate down the road as we continue to prove out our capacity to drive cost savings and improve clinical outcomes for our customers.
we certainly have a rich track record of doing so, but it's not something i've modeled into our plan. shantanu, do you want to hit the question about brick-and-mortar care?
shantanu nundy -- chief medical officer
yeah, absolutely. and it's a great question. you know, i think one of the things that we really liked about the plushcare platform is that it's really purpose-built for primary care, right? so that means that there -- we're able to provide comprehensive primary care. so to your point about lab draws partnering with national laboratories for that, same thing goes with partnering with pharmacies around the country around medications, delivering vaccines at the point of care within pharmacies.
and so i think really that point that raj alluded to around collaboration, that's really the key. as someone who still practices primary care and brick-and-mortar context, you know, there's a significant portion of my patients who need to see a specialist that needs to go elsewhere. similarly, if you're providing primary care virtually, you're absolutely right that it's going to be a portion of patients, perhaps 10% or so, who are going to need to have something done in a brick-and-mortar context. i think the question -- the key either way is really how are you enabling that collaboration.
and i think for us, that's where our data and technology platform comes from -- comes in. i think if you think about how we've built an ecosystem and all the different partnerships that we talked about earlier in the call, it's the same sort of concept that we believe is going to be really the key, and that's what patients are looking for ultimately. they're looking for us to deliver a service to them and for us to really put those pieces together in an experience that works.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan macdonald with needham and company. you may proceed with your question.
ryan macdonald -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. i appreciate the additional color on the long-term targets here. as you think about that progression toward breakeven adjusted ebitda and sort of the revenue threshold that you need to hit, as you look out the next couple of years, how visible -- or how much visibility do you think you have on to some of the areas around virtual primary care or expert md and sort of the consistency or the linearity of that progression when you think about the organic move toward that breakeven level? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, thanks for the question, ryan. appreciate it. it's steve. you know, one of the things we're seeing that we're really bullish about as we sit here in the fourth quarter is the power of the platform, the diversification of it, the fact that we're seeing strong contributions across the board from -- in terms of new customer growth in expert medical opinion to complement advocacy, plushcare, the direct-to-consumer virtual primary care business growing very nicely on its own, while taking care of some of the emo volumes that you see a bit being a bit soft.
as we head into next year, we have a strong base of contracted revenue that gives us confidence in that guide for the -- think of it as the advocacy and expert medical opinion, the b2b or enterprise business. and the plushcare business performing very strongly on its own, really, in all aspects in terms of new subscriber, acquisitions, visit rates, customer satisfaction, doctor satisfaction on the platform, all of that gives us confidence that the foundation is strong, and we get -- it gives us good visibility toward obviously next year. and then you think about the fact that most of our contracts tend to be long-term contracts, so three-year business-to-business contracts, so we've got good visibility there. we've got strong retention, high net promoter scores across our member base.
so all of those things combined with a strong roi for our customers is really the backbone that we build our business on and our revenue models on. so those all combined to give us the visibility.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from richard close with canaccord genuity. you may proceed with your question.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah. given the second opinion or 2nd.md trends, do you still expect the contingency consideration thresholds to be achieved? and then what is the timing again? i know you said calendar '22 for the shares to come in. but can you give us sort of the quarterly timing? i know since your february year-end, i'm not sure if it comes in, in the fourth quarter.Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. hi, richard, i appreciate the question. yes, so a couple of things. on the -- so each of the 2nd.md and the plushcare acquisitions had a contingent consideration or an earnout associated with them.
the plushcare calculation will be based on a calendar year 2021 basis. so we expect that to wrap up by the end of the fiscal year here, fiscal '22. and for 2nd.md, there's an earnout there as well, which will be based in large part on a january 2022 or this month run rate revenue. so we expect those to all be wrapped up, if not completely by the end of the fiscal year, certainly by fiscal -- q1 of fiscal 2023.
and you'll see a calculation in the q, in large part, those we expect to be earned fully, but we're doing those final calculations over the next month or so, and we'll have more to report on that in the next quarterly call.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from stephanie davis with svb leerink. you may proceed with your question.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi, guys. congrats on the quarter. i've got a two-part question on the out-year margin guidance. first specific and then a little more generalized.
so on the specific side, should we think about the ebitda margin as benefiting from a step-up in '23, given the contract wind-down that was unprofitable in a more linear path from '23 to '25? or is there any new ones in there? and then just more generally, what are the toggles that could get us above or below the preliminary '23 and '25 ebitda figures?Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
stephanie, thank you for the question. it's steve. would you mind repeating the first part about the specific point about ebitda? that broke up just a little bit, and i'm not sure i heard it clearly.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
no worries. i'm just saying for the '23 figure, does that benefit from a step-up in margins given the unprofitable contract wind down? or should we think of that as a more linear path as we get to '25?Â 
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
i understand now. yeah, on a, you know, marginal basis, that $9 million or so, our point there was that yes, it was essentially a lower gross margin bit of business. so there's some uplift there. i think overall, it's fairly minor.
the underlying key point for us is that gross margin expansion will be a contributor there. we expect something in the mid-40%, 45% range for this current year, fiscal '22, and expanding that up that we expect it to go up into the high 40s toward 50% by that fiscal '25 breakeven date on a somewhat linear path to give you some more color there. and then the toggles up and down against that certainly will have to do with the success level that we have with driving better engagement and more engagement of these case rate revenues on the expert medical opinion business and on visits on the virtual primary care and mental health side as we bring together all of the offerings and the offerings that we're calling accolade care and accolade one. and then finally, in the out-year fiscal '25 and beyond, you know, we've spoken about this opportunity for gain share revenues in accolade one.
we have not made any grand assumptions in our target models around that. we think it's important that we learn about how that goes, but there certainly would be upside there if we were to perform well against those gain share opportunities, and we'll report more on that in the coming quarters. thanks again for the question.
operator

rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and happy new year. i hope you're all able to enjoy time with family and friends during the holiday season. as we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we continue to make outstanding progress toward building a great and enduring healthcare company. in fiscal q3, we outperformed our guidance across the board and are again raising our forecast for the year.
steve, our cfo, will cover the specifics later in the call, including more detail on how to look at accolade now that we've diversified our offering portfolio, expanded our go-to-market engine, and become a more strategic enabler of our customers' people objectives when it comes to providing health and wellness benefits that drive employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention. but i couldn't resist a little teaser to first hit some key points. at our core, we're dedicated to consistently delivering on our commitments quarter after quarter. today, we're providing you with preliminary guidance for fiscal 2023, reaffirming our commitment to our long-term growth rate and our path to profitability.
our progress due to the hard work of our colleagues is nothing short of remarkable. i'll outline that progress for you briefly now before turning the call over to steve. as we entered the current fiscal year, accolade was an advocacy company serving about 100 customers, representing 2 million members with a $24 billion addressable market. today, we have more than 600 customers, representing more than 10 million members, and our market opportunity has grown 10 times to more than $200 billion.
with our integrated offerings and expanded partner services built on top of the market's leading healthcare engagement engine, we own the personalized healthcare category. from a business perspective, this has resulted in far more diversified foundation. at the time of our ipo, our single largest customer represented 25% of our total revenues, and our top four customers made up 60% of our revenues. today, no single customer represents more than 10% of revenues.
most importantly, thanks to our broad portfolio of advocacy, expert medical opinion, primary care, and mental health services, we are far more strategic and valuable to the customers and members that we serve. that's demonstrated in our performance. so far this year, more than 20 new enterprise customers bought accolade advocacy and accolade expert md together. more than 20 existing advocacy customers have purchased accolade expert md.
in less than three months after we launched accolade care and accolade one, our first tranche of customers have already gone live on the solution. additionally, our momentum in new customer growth continues with leading organizations like halliburton, choctaw nation of oklahoma, and choice hotels joining our customer base. these data points reflect both the strength of our strategic relationship with our customers and their belief in the vision of personalized healthcare that we set forth to the market. already, the combination of our services is driving higher utilization rates for expert medical opinion when delivered in tandem with advocacy.
we expect the same patterns to hold with our virtual primary care and mental health services, providing further proof points that services layered on top of our engagement platform will drive outsized engagement and performance. just as our offering suite, pricing model, and customer base are diversified and differentiated, so too is our go-to-market strategy. we have a long track record of reaching new customers via direct sales channel that has been remarkably efficient and effective. more recently, we've added health plan partners like optum, aetna, blue cross blue shield of michigan, blue shield of california, and humana as referral and reseller partners.
additionally, new partnerships with leading companies like plansource represent our commitment to meeting customers where and how they choose to buy. on that foundation, we are well-positioned for the future. as i mentioned earlier, looking at fiscal 2023 from a financial perspective, we're committed to delivering against our long-standing goal of 25% top-line growth into the foreseeable future and we will improve our adjusted ebitda loss in the year ahead, both on a dollar and percentage of revenue basis. and as steve will describe in more detail, we're projecting adjusted ebitda breakeven in fiscal 2025 at approximately $600 million of revenue.
at accolade, we believe that you can build a lasting healthcare company, a growth engine, and a disciplined business at the same time. that's how we're running our company. earlier this month, we shared our set of beliefs about how healthcare is supposed to work for people in this country. stealing the words of simon sinek, it's important for companies to have a just cause that brings its employees, customers, partners, and shareholders together.
our just cause is that we believe healthcare is a human right, and that everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status, should have access to the care that they need. we believe in treating the whole person by building long-term trusted relationships, not just the symptom or the transaction. we believe that mental health and physical health are completely intertwined to support the whole person. and we know that it's time for our industry to start getting paid for outcomes, not just for providing services.
you can find our credo in the we believe section on our website. we run our business with a further commitment to those beliefs every day. if the past two years have taught us anything, it's that we can only predict so much about the future, whether it's covid or government and policy changes or the labor market. our customers expect us to remain true to our mission and our beliefs and that's how we operate at accolade.
before i turn the call over to steve, one last point. health care today represents 20% of our country's gdp. it is massive, and it needs to do better at serving people. no single company will solve the problem.
but collectively, we can and we must strive to improve. we're committed to partnering with others who share our beliefs, with those who embody this deeper sense of purpose for the people we serve. through empathy, experience, and most critically, engagement and trust, we can light up those partner services on the basis of our open platform and the most advanced technology stack in the industry. in the last year alone, we added sword, virta, carrot fertility, vivante health, and employer direct healthcare to the industry's most comprehensive partner ecosystem.
our progress in each of these areas, new offerings, more innovation, more partners, and doubling down on the importance of advocacy at the heart of connecting the healthcare ecosystem is why we continue to grow and thrive and why all of us at accolade are so excited about the future. with that, let me turn the call over to steve barnes, our chief financial officer. steve?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, raj. first, i'll recap the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. keep in mind that we closed the 2nd.md acquisition in q1 and the plushcare acquisition in early q2. where appropriate, i'll provide color on year-over-year comparisons and [inaudible] additional pro forma detail in the 10-q.
we generated $83.5 million in revenue in the third fiscal quarter, representing a 117% year-over-year growth on a gaap basis over the prior-year period. this reflects a significant beat against the top end of our guidance range. you'll recall that after the second quarter, we indicated that we expected to recognize $2.5 million of performance guarantee revenue in q3 instead of q4. as a result of continued strong execution against our performance metrics, we recognized closer to $7 million of pg revenues in q3 rather than q4, inclusive of the $2.5 million in our previous guidance.
we also saw favorable member count and pg performance compared to our original forecast. on a pro forma basis, the combined business grew 44% year over year, broken down as 45% growth for accolade advocacy, 28% growth for accolade expert md and 53% growth for direct-to-consumer virtual primary care or plushcare. plushcare continues to perform strongly and benefit from the tailwind of covid pushing more people toward virtual primary care, while our expert medical opinion business was relatively flat on a sequential basis as fewer medical procedures than expected are contributing to a reduction in second opinion. i'll come back to this dynamic in my guidance for q4 and fiscal '23.
fiscal q3 adjusted gross margin was 47% compared to 41.8% in the prior-year period, which reflects the positive revenue fee, as well as investments in staffing our frontline care teams to support growth and integration. while q3 gross margin was favorably impacted by the revenue timing item, as stated in prior earnings calls, we expect adjusted gross margin to remain relatively flat on a full year fiscal '22 basis compared to fiscal 2021. adjusted ebitda in the third quarter of fiscal '22 was a loss of $11.9 million, which compares to $11.4 million loss in the prior year third fiscal quarter. this is significantly ahead of our guidance, primarily due to the performance guarantee revenue timing item noted above, as well as lower spending than planned in the quarter in some areas such as hiring and personnel costs.
turning to the balance sheet. cash and cash equivalents totaled $366 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter, and accounts receivable dsos were in line with prior quarters at about 24 days revenue outstanding. finally, we had approximately 66.9 million shares of common stock outstanding as of november 30, 2021. this does not include any shares related to the 2nd.md or plushcare earn-outs.
for your models, there are up to approximately 2.2 million additional shares related to the 2nd.md earn-out and up to 1.4 million shares related to the plushcare earn-out to be issued in calendar 2022. and now turning to guidance. for the fiscal fourth quarter ending february 28, 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $90 million to $93 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 138% and 13% on a pro forma basis to adjust for the acquisitions of 2nd.md and plushcare. adjusted ebitda loss for the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $4 million to $8 million.
to provide some context on the year-over-year growth rates in the guidance, keep in mind that we have recognized approximately $8 million of pg revenue through the first three x quarters that we initially forecasted to be recognized in the fourth quarter. this $8 million is comprised of the $7 million in q3 noted earlier and $1 million in q1. if you were to add that back to q4, the year-over-year growth rate in q4 would be about 25%, and q3 would have been 32% growth instead of 44%. as a reminder, we recognize pg revenues upon achievement of the underlying performance guarantees.
pgs include a variety of items such as member engagement rates, member satisfaction, clinical metrics and cost savings-based metrics. the mix and timing of pgs varies, but to be clear, achieving and recognizing pg revenue in early quarters is positive. as we establish a track record of consistently achieving our pgs and recognizing them more evenly throughout the year, it will have the impact of lessening our historical q4 revenue bump. also, those pg revenues typically come in at a much higher positive impact to gross margin and adjusted ebitda.
the net of all this is that we consistently point you to the full year numbers, which are not subject to the quarterly movements of pg revenue recognition timing and margin within a given year. moving to guidance for the fiscal year ended february 28, 2022. we expect revenue in the range of $306 million to $309 million, representing 81% growth over the prior year at the midpoint and 30% on a pro forma basis to adjust for the acquisitions of 2nd.md and plushcare. adjusted ebitda loss for the year in the range of $48 million to $52 million, representing approximately negative 16% of revenues at the midpoint of guidance.
we also provide a preliminary view of fiscal 2023 revenue guidance today. based on our current estimates and assuming no significant change in the healthcare spend environment, we project revenue will grow approximately 25% over fiscal year 2022 to about $385 million and expect adjusted ebitda loss will improve to about 11% to 12% of revenues as we continue on our path to profitability after pausing for a year on that progress while completing the acquisitions and making material progress on integration. to help you build your models and understand the components of the revenue growth, our guidance breaks down like this. we expect the core accolade business to grow approximately 25%, in line with our previous statements.
our virtual primary care business, which in fiscal '23 will be driven by our plushcare direct-to-consumer business, is experiencing strong growth, and we expect it will grow about 30% next year. and while we remain very confident in the expert medical opinion market opportunity and have driven significant customer additions in that space since the acquisition, until we see second opinion volumes return to historical norms, we forecast accolade expert md revenue will grow approximately 20% next year. underlying our guidance, of course, is the acv or annual contract value as of fiscal 2022 year-end. as you know, acv is not a final metric until the year is over, but as promised, we wanted to give you some color from the end of the selling season, particularly as it helps you build your models for fiscal '23.
as an important reference point, when we went public about 18 months ago, acv represented the near totality of our book of business, and as such, was a good proxy for modeling our following year's revenue. today, acv remains a very useful metric for modeling a large portion of our revenue. but given the changes in the business since our ipo, we will continue to evolve a metric to ensure it stays relevant as you build your models. more specifically, acv historically would not include emo case rate revenue nor would it include the plushcare consumer revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees, as well as visit fees.
given that we are evolving the business toward case rate revenues from pepm for expert medical opinion as we leverage the strength of our engagement platform, when we report in april on the final acv metric for the end of fiscal '22, we expect to include our estimate of emo case rate revenues, as well as contracted enterprise virtual primary care revenues. most importantly, our goal here is to help you understand the different inputs of our business to effectively model our growth. first, recall that acv at the end of fiscal year 2021 was approximately $248 million adjusted to include 2nd.md on a pro forma basis. at that time, we said acv did not include the portion of 2nd.md revenue that was built on a case rate basis.
you start with that base and then build. next, with the vast majority of new business signed, we are on track to sign between $50 million and $60 million of new business in the current fiscal year. year-end acv will include all pepm revenue plus our estimate of emo case rate revenue and enterprise primary care visit fees. then we add or subtract normal customer adjustments such as changes in headcounts or terminations.
and as we said before, we model for approximately 95% gross dollar retention, and we're on track for that this year. additionally, we have one unusual item impacting acv and revenue next year, which is that we made the decision not to renew a legacy health plan customer relationship that had become particularly low margin and nonstrategic as our business evolves. while that lowers fiscal 2023 revenue and acv by approximately $9 million, we believe it's a prudent decision to walk away from business that does not fit within our financial and strategic profile. and that's a framework that will get us to a final acv at february 28, 2022.
in order to build to the fiscal 2023 25% revenue growth projection, you would start with that acv which includes the advocacy, expert md and enterprise virtual primary care offering, add revenue for new business sold and launched within fiscal 2023, plus incremental partner revenue, adjust for timing of launches and add to that the fiscal 2023 plushcare or consumer virtual primary care revenue forecast. the net of all of that brings you to the 25% revenue growth rate in our preliminary guidance. now before turning to your questions, i'd like to highlight an important item, which is our path to breakeven, including a picture of the leverage in our pricing model as we add the new solutions to the portfolio. we've consistently stated that our goal is to make meaningful progress toward profitability each year on the strength of our revenue growth and attractive unit economics.
we also guided to a pause in that progress for the current fiscal year as we absorbed two significant acquisitions. and as you can see in our guidance for next year, we expect to continue making meaningful progress on that path. i'd like to go a little deeper to help you understand not just the timing, but also the underlying unit economics. for those of you looking at the slides on our webcast, you can see our historical march toward breakeven.
in fiscal 2018, accolade was a $77 million revenue business with adjusted gross margin of just over 30% and an adjusted ebitda loss of 56% of revenue. over the next few years, even while we invested heavily in technology, sales and distribution and added the cost of being a public company, our gross margins improved materially and the adjusted ebitda loss declined as a percentage of revenue from negative 56% to 41% to 25% and then negative 16% in fiscal '21 before flattening out this year. with our preliminary guidance for next year, you can see that adjusted ebitda improved from negative 16% this year to an 11% to 12% range in fiscal '23, then cuts in half the following year with a breakeven target in fiscal year 2025. and that improvement in fiscal 2023 would represent a reduction in the adjusted ebitda loss on an absolute dollar basis as well.
from a size and scale perspective, 25% annual revenue growth over that same period leads to a $600 million revenue target at breakeven in fiscal year 2025. it's also helpful to show you how the unit economics work for the legacy accolade business, as well as the incremental margin contribution from our new solutions. if you start with the legacy accolade advocacy business, you can see the unit economics in the chart that i just shared. pepm for our full suite was approximately $20 and the historical improvement in adjusted ebitda and gross margin was largely driven by the incremental gross margin from existing customers as we increase engagement and build deeper relationships with our members.
the new solutions we added this year, particularly expert medical opinion and primary care, are generally priced on a per visit or a per case basis. those visits and consultations are delivered at a higher incremental gross margin than the advocacy revenue, which we expect to further expand as we leverage our advocacy engagement investment with cross-sell customers providing additional lift to the model. on top of that, as we gain traction with our accolade one solution, there is additional opportunity for increased margin contribution from gain share performance. and lastly, we expect our partner revenue to grow nicely this year and into the future also at a higher margin than our advocacy business.
we are not changing our long-term target model today, but if you think about the expected growth and contribution from these solutions, you can begin to see the layering effect of adding higher gross margin revenue in the years to come. advocacy will remain the largest revenue contributor this year and next and we expect higher margin case rate and visit fees to grow in fiscal '24 and beyond. and we expect our higher margin gain share revenue may contribute in fiscal '24 and beyond as we expand beyond our initial pilot customers. as such, we believe we are building a business foundation and portfolio to drive growth and margin improvement for years to come.
and with that, we'll open the call to questions.Â

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] so our first question comes from the line of michael cherny from bank of america. please go ahead.
mike cherry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for all the color. i think, i want to dive in a bit on the differential in your commentary steve a little bit further and also make sure i heard correctly. so if you think about that bridging in the 25% growth that you had estimated on the last earnings call. comcast takes out a little more than 1% of that or 1.5%, i guess, based on the timing seems it maybe 1% on bookings? when you talk about the conservative nature of the rest of the business, how much of that is truly in year business wins versus how much is some of the dynamics around performance-based fees that you may expect or expect not to get versus how much is employment levels at your customers.
and that's a lot of moving pieces, i just want to make sure we can bridge a little bit better. and i just have one quick clarification after.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
so mike, thanks for the question. first, you're right that comcast and a, bit softness in the arr bookings in fiscal 2022 do come off the top for roughly a point headwind on growth. the remainder of the guide is across the various factors you mentioned we're softening the guidance across the board to recognize the macro environment. primarily, as it relates to being thoughtful around headcounts in a highly inflationary environment for sure being thoughtful around the timing of being able to book and launch new business in the year.
and in part, recognizing that buying decisions last year pushed a bit toward the end, which is what resulted in the prompter arr. while our win rates means strong when there is a decision we're thoughtful about the fact that-some of those decisions were slower. one of the very important points to ask mike as we address all of that was in looking at the revenue softness, we look directly to our spend and profitability and you see that we beat fiscal 2022 fourth quarter handsomely. in terms of bottom lines, as well as top lines, and we're rolling that forward to remain committed to the overall profitability structure from here through to fiscal 2025 positive ebitda.
mike cherry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and it's -- the one clarification, you talked about the 20% annual revenue growth excluding comcast. just want to make sure that's completely out of the baseline in terms of how to think about 2024 and 2025 i want to make sure i get that -- the math correct on and how you think about that given that the 2025 number came down by about $100 million overall?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
that's right, mike. so what we're effectively doing there. if you think about comcast in fiscal 2022 having been about $28 million of revenue take about five out you get to your fiscal 2023 number you have to back that out and then put a 20% growth rate on top of that compounding for the next two years. that's how you get to the approximately $500 million in fiscal 2025.
mike cherry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks.

thank you. [operator instructions] and i show our next question comes from the line of ryan daniels from william blair. please go ahead.
ryan daniels -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. i don't know how much detail you can go into this. but clearly a question we'll get is in regards to the comcast relationship, especially, it was an anchor tenant for the organization so clearly, good relationship.
you had 12 years with them multiple renewals? so they like the service, they got the roi, what was it that led to the change on a go-forward basis to kind of end that relationship was it -- what you talked about with competitive pricing, you indicated the pricing would have made it much less than 10% going forward under newer terms. so i just want to get a little more color on what you're referring to there and maybe what drove that loss? thank you.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yeah, appreciate the question, ryan, this is raj, a few thoughts first and foremost, i appreciate you pointing out the fact that the -- comcast relationship has been a really productive one over the course of 12 years and multiple contract renewals. we think over time and customers begin to evaluate different buying criteria in terms of what they're most interested in, and i can't speak specifically to all the rationale for comcast buying criteria. but i can say, we're really focused on servicing clients who are looking at improving healthcare outcomes while achieving that the return on investment that's associated with achieving those healthcare outcomes. and so, in terms of -- that specific instance i would say, we may have seen a divergence of those modes of admission there and for us it's imperative to just point out.
we've had a customer retention rate ryan of 90% on an ongoing basis for many years first and secondly that we view this as an isolated event does not one that we expect to repeat itself for the customer base.
operator
thank you. i show our next question comes from the line of jonathan young from credit suisse. please go ahead.
jonathan young -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. i guess, when you think about the 20% growth rate. when adjusting for comcast on a go-forward basis, how much conservatism are you kind of building into that because, obviously, the comcast relationship was a bit of a surprise to you give -- to us given how long that relationship has gone? so i'm just wondering how much conservatism is built into our top line and then come measurably with that when you think about that bridge to break to positive ebitda in 2025 given the current inflationary environment and kind of what's going on. are there any pushes and pulls on any of the hiring that you'll need to do to achieve that 20% and achieve that ebitda positive number that you're talking about? thanks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
i think, we're having a bit of a hard time hearing you. we'll trying to recap your question. i think that steve will go yes to pick that?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
we'll recap your question. please catch us, yes, catch us if we're missing it. i think, you asked the question how much conservatism is baked into the 20% growth rate, excluding comcast and what impact, if any, would the inflationary pressures have on our high rate ability to achieve that 20% growth rate.
jonathan young -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes, yes.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
ok, steve, sure.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
i'll get back, so johnson, first of all on the level of conservatism, i mean, 20%. when we look at it starts with our, with our pipelines as raj mentioned in his comments, the pipeline is strong and we're seeing a lot of interest in particularly in terms of rfp volume from customers, large and small, many of which had never purchased an efficacy offering. so based upon that relative to ratios that we see in terms of deals closed the size of the pipeline, we feel like that's a good estimate. and we are tempering -- a bit though, given the macroeconomic factors and the possibility that decisions will push.
so the 20% we put together on that is based on a really a pragmatic view, in a clearly difficult environment. in terms of people and inflationary environment, this is top of mind for us. obviously, we're really in inflationary environment, where we address that through a broad set of employee benefits, not just salary, but also saving with stock and attracting great people to the mission and business that we have here. that comprehensive package and i alluded to it in my comments of making sure we're aligning with employees across all of those vectors is built into what we see.
one last comment there as we look at managing our spending, and as we bring the growth rate, we look very hard at rigorous spending control opportunities that we have across the book. remember, we're still barely a year into two significant acquisitions, where we see more opportunities to lean into integration, etc. and then, finally, with a large customer transitioning, will we see opportunities there as far as reallocation is spent.
operator
thank you. i show our next question comes from the line of glen santangelo from jefferies. please go ahead.
glen santangelo -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. raj and steve, i want to flush out some of these comments on this revenue shortfall. because it seems like you take your revenue guidance down by call it roughly $35 million. and if we know comcast is i don't know a little more than $5 million of that for a couple months.
it seems like the shortfall, here's at least $25 million to $30 million? now you said that you had some expectation of new business about $50 million to $60 million. and half of that maybe didn't show up and i'm trying to figure out what happened from january 10. when you reported your last quarter, when seemingly you had some visibility on all the january 1 starts to kind of now. and then, if you could just roll into that you're sort of comments about the competitive landscape and some competition, lowering prices? i just want to make sure i understand the competitive dynamics and also the last part, and then i'm done or plushcare.
and second md are they performing up to your expectations or is any of that $30 million in weakness, coming out of either of those two businesses? thanks, and i'll stop there.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks, glen. and so, the bridge to the midpoint it's about $27.5 million to the midpoint. let me just take that break that down in pieces. first of all, comcast costs $5 million bucks.
on the arr shortfall from prior year, we came in at the bottom and essentially of that $50 million to $60 million range in the booking of about $55 million or so when you adjusted for pgas, at the end of about 50 figures. there's a another five to 10 there. all right. after that you're talking about really a broad, just softening particularly around the advocacy side.
the amo business continues to perform along the lines of what we described in the last call, although we're certainly cautious about what the procedures, as we spoken about the virtual primary care business remains in line with what we talked about. the advocacy business is really where we see because it tends to be a larger purchase for our broadest offering, where we are tempering our expectations around not just new business bookings, but also being super thoughtful around employment and other variables that go into the revenues associated with that book, given the inflationary and potentially recessionary environment we're heading into.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jeff garro from piper sandler. please go ahead.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i want to dive a little deeper in the comments on the macro environment and pricing. so i would ask if the predatory pricing or just aggressive pricing, is that on any particular offering or across all? and then, how should we think about performance guarantees and your ability to offset lower based pricing from peers with the promise of stronger results?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff, for the question. i think, in terms of when you think about pricing, i think we're clearly now having established a brand new category and personalized healthcare and it's establishing that the category is actually very interesting to customers while we are. but what we're looking at this year's revenues, and moderating those expectations, we are continuing to see a really strong demand environment from customers looking at personalized healthcare. because of that we've attracted as a set -- as you would in any space that's growing at this kind of clip.
we've attracted a lot of competition, some of them are approaching the space with lower print with materially lower price points, others who are looking at it from a materially lower service quality perspective. we think over time, those things iron themselves out ultimately, customers are seeking, as we noted in our prepared remarks. customers are seeking improved healthcare outcomes, and return on investment. we traditionally see that in our full service advocacy offering.
and what we're beginning to see already is the early stages of customers who having chosen in the past lower costs, lower engagement, lower outcome orientation solutions, are now coming back into our pipeline and revisiting actually solution as the chosen course or path. so i'd think you got the answer your question directly, we're really thinking more about the fuller service advocacy offerings as it relates to the pricing pressure. but we expect over time that that in the near term, that pricing pressure will alleviate itself, as customers choose value over price. and just as it relates to performance guarantees and the thoughts we have in our guidance here is always with performance guarantees for athletes, take that into two pieces.
first, you have the operational type performance guarantees that relate to engagement rates and customer satisfaction rates and other kinds of engagement and operational rigor that we apply. and we continue to have very good visibility there and apply that same type of view toward fiscal '23. savings based revenues similarly, although, as you know, those kind of bounced around a little bit, particularly coming out of covid healthcare trend has been a radical over the last couple of years. so we do apply some additional hedging there to ensure that our forecasts represent a range where we feel confident.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ricky goldwasser from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi, good afternoon. so it's a two-part question. the first one when you think about your forecast between now through 2025 and that cagr of 20% top-line growth. are you assuming any price pressure on that 20% or your assuming sort of a steady state and to your point that your customers will ultimately kind of understand the value.
and the second part of the question as we think about the -- your large employer book. can you just tell us what percent off the book is up for in your next couple of years?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
ricky, thanks for the questions. in terms of the first point, what we -- one of the things that we take the most part in is both the incredible demand environment and the number of evaluations that we're participating in today, given the long-term win rate of the business, and the continuation of that win rate into this fiscal year. the second part of that story from a pricing assumption perspective is we are receiving vendor of choice selections and new business wins right now, at price points that are very similar to where we've operated in the past. customers are aware of particularly in a space like healthcare, what we're talking about delivering healthcare services with doctors and nurses, and frontline care teams, that there is a cost of delivering services like that, and particularly customers who are focused on improving clinical outcomes, clinical quality, and return on investment, have continued to demonstrate the capacity and the wherewithal to choose solutions that may be higher price than others.
but are demonstrated value and a proven demonstrated value over the years. so that's part one in terms of our cover part go forward assumptions. in terms of customer renewals, we have customers every year who are up for renewal. and as we put it out in the past tricky for where, because of the incredible value of deliver for our customers, our renewal rates are our customer retention rates, if they're 95%, or at least the last five years, and probably longer than that.
and so, we continue to see them in fact, the vast majority of our customers renew their agreements with us because of the value we've provided and the relationships that we've built with their employees in the past.
operator
thank you. i saw our next question comes from the line of cindy matson from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
cindy matson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. yeah, just following up because on the revenue retention, i guess, what i'm feeling like is you're expecting maybe that would continue that, in the b2b market, it feels like some of this, maybe competitive pricing does not fly maybe it is more of a temporary thing like is some players try to win customers, but then in the end if you're running business and everything, you have to think about the sustainability of that whether they're going to be continue to be well funded and be around. so i guess, would you sort of say that this is something it sounds like that you think is more temporary? but then, i also just didn't want to ask a second one, just about the cadence of ebitda, because it looks like, obviously, it's better than we would have expected full year, you're expecting so i guess, not the next quarter, but it looks like it's going to be maybe positive through the third and fourth quarter anyway, if you could just give us something about the cadence there. and i'll stop and maybe ask one more follow-up.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, cindy. let me take the first question. and then, i'll let steve take the second question regarding it and the distribution of ebitda for the year. i think, they -- the answer to your question as it relates to the competitive landscape and customer retention is in line with the way you ask the question.
absolutely, we believe this is a isolated bet we intend. we've got great visibility in the customer retention on a year-over-year basis. and we expect that our retention rates remain on a midterm, long-term basis, in that very high 90% to 90-plus-percent range on an ongoing basis. but over time, there will be in any market, particularly when growing this path.
the majority of our evaluations, are evaluations for greenfield brand new customers who have never looked at advocacy or personalized healthcare before. that said there is on occasion, some customer trading. i referenced in my prepared remarks today that we've added customers from our competition where our customer are consolidating all love expert medical opinion, virtual primary care and advocacy into our relationship. and we've seen that in a number of different spots.
that said, by and large, we're really focused on continuing to grow the organic space that's here and we expect that that will continue for the foreseeable future. so if you want to hit the ebitda of what to be sure. so cindy, the cadence of ebitda for fiscal '23 -- fiscal or excuse me, the first fiscal quarter will be the low watermark if you will on the guidance be provided and then fiscal second and third quarter trend down, but still a negative and then a fourth quarter positive ebitda just send that up to the 37.5 million point.
cindy matson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. yes, now that makes sense. and then, i guess, i mean, if i could just add one more. so as we project forward, i guess, we see a similar sort of, like seasonality or way if i mean, if you have any color, that will be helpful.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
sure. yeah, that shade of on a quarterly basis is a good one to use. similarly, in fiscal '24. and we provided in the presentation there, you'd see that we expect that long the cut about in half by in fiscal '24, with a positive in fiscal '25.
but given the business seasonality in that persists as well.
operator
thank you. i saw our next question comes from the line of ryan macdonald from needham. please go ahead.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. steve, i think, you mentioned in the prepared remarks about gross margin impact from comcast coming out of the model, as it being a more mature customer being a bit of creative to gross margins. can you sort of walk us through what sort of expectations for gross margins are or the magnitude of that impact in fiscal '23. and then, as we think about the bridge to the adjusted ebitda maybe where some of those cost efficiencies can come into the model, as we think about the opex line.
thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
ryan, so on more mature customers when we ramp up a new customer, there's a fair amount of investments to be made. and in both on the opex side and on the frontline care team side, the cost service line. so that is a thought of a little bit north of the corporate average gross margin that will come out in fiscal '24. so fiscal '24 gross margin, you can think of as roughly flat to a bit of fiscal '23, we expect to take a little bit of a hit there.
but importantly, when we look across the business and look for opportunities, around cost savings, again, we just came off a year of beginning to integrate three businesses in which we see more opportunities to lean into those. and in transitioning contracts off particularly in the opex line, there are opportunities to reallocate that spend in other areas. so those are some of the target areas that we have for reducing some sense of growth areas as we lower our top-line growth rates.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst

thank you. i saw our next question comes from the line of sandy draper from guggenheim. please go ahead.
sandy draper -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks very much. just first, a quick housekeeping question. and apologies if i missed it, do you guys give the actual revenue breakouts between advocacy expert and the virtual primary care/plushcare?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sandy, this is steve. we haven't specifically though on the last call, we spoke to an expert medical opinion growth rate in the neighborhood of 20% and the virtual primary care/plushcare business close to the 30%. and what we're saying to you today is that that advocacy line is coming down to based upon the factors that we gave today. and those are how you aggregate that down.
and you'll see in the 10-k filing tomorrow, the spread, but if you can think of the business as about 65% or so advocacy today with the balance across expert medical opinion and virtual primary care.
sandy draper -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
ok, great. i'll wait for that on 10-k. appreciate that. and then, my broader question and it's sort of been asked in a slightly different angle.
just trying to think in this macro environment. if i put myself in the shoes of an hr person there's a lot of challenges there, they're being pressured with retaining people, hiring people, the paying maybe higher bonuses, high signing bonuses, retention, bonuses, etc. i can understand why they would maybe not want to commit to a new purchase or be hesitant to step-up. until, i'm wondering, have you seen signs of that? is that what you're factoring in? and maybe as a follow-on to that, is this a situation where someone's less likely to do accolade one and do the all in and say, yes, that makes sense but that's a much bigger ticket item.
we're just going to do have as advocacy. we're not going to do all three. i'm just trying to knock out the rois, there and longer term this won't happen. but maybe those are the pressures that are at play.
i'm just trying to get the additional commentary there. thanks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. i think, it's a really great one, sandy. and i think, here's the way we think about it. first, while we do see a really strong demand environment, and customers are really focused to your point, they're focused on retaining their employees in a market that at least today is a very full employment market.
and they're also focused on addressing issues like healthcare, equity, etc. that in the last year and fiscal 2022, we saw some defocusing of buyers attention based on their focus on return to office and those things covid and pandemic-related, and i think we're cautiously optimistic about the future this year, looking at the demand environment and the number of evaluations that were participating in. we're clearly looking to see the number of opportunities to progress and actually make buying decisions. when customers make buying decisions, we have a very strong win rate.
or when prospects make buying decisions, we have a really strong win rate, to the degree those buying decisions actually occur or versus customers choosing to kick the can down the road after an evaluation cycle, which leads to the second part of your question, which is why is there a likelihood that customers might be evaluating components of our solutions versus the entirety of our solutions and act like one. and i think, it's a various to point i think customers will continue to want to buy in components. and it's really a significant driver of the way we've architected our strategies to be able to meet a customer where they'd like to be met, whether that's an expert medical opinion, virtual primary care and mental health or advocacy, or in those cases where it's all of the above. so yes, i think, there may be a propensity for that type of buying to occur this year.
and we'll have a lot more data as we come is we come back in q2 and the q3 earnings calls.
sandy draper -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
great. really helpful commentary. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. i saw our next question comes from the line of stephanie davis from svb securities. please go ahead.
stephanie davis -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi, guys, thank you for taking my question. i was hoping to talk a little bit more about the forward evolution of your pricing model. we're seeing some pushback in the employer market around pmpm solutions. and i know you've talked about going more risk on some of your products.
so how should we think about maybe the mix of how you're selling and how you are looking at your follow-up pricing?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, stephanie. i think, we've consistently over the course of the last several years, we call it over the last five years. we've delivered to customers pricing solution, that gave them an opportunity to put a percentage of our fees at risk. typically, that number has been in the neighborhood of about 30% of our fees at risk.
that's been consistent year over year and continues to be fairly consistent in terms of the outlook of the existence of the transactions that are occurring in fiscal 2023. and our view on the, those customer contracts that we're most interested in pursuing in fiscal 2023. we believe that a percentage of our fees at risk associated with clinical outcomes return on investment, and employee satisfaction are appropriate for most of our customers. there will be those customers who take advantage.
and you've heard this before from us, stephanie, there'll be those customers who take advantage of all of our solutions, looking at advocacy, expert medical opinion, primary care and mental health and a suite of partner solutions, where we've got the capacity to be more proactively managing all of their population health and the choices that they're making across the ecosystem. and in those situations where we have a more pronounced control capacity, we're willing and able to take more fees more at risk. we don't think that's the preponderance of our customer base. when we expect that over the course of fiscal '23, you're going to see a customer breakdown that looks fairly similar or a new customer breakdown that looks fairly similar to the breakdown you saw in '22 or '21.
operator
thank you. i saw next question comes from the line of richard close from canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah, obviously, it's been a competitive business for some time. so i'm just curious, your thoughts on the pricing environment and maybe a timeline of when it deteriorated or is the pricing environment more competitive? as a follow-on to stephanie's question in turn terms of other people coming in and going more at risk. any thoughts there would be helpful?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
richard, i think, the -- we look at the competitive dynamic in the following ways you can tier prospects who are looking at solutions in our category, as those who are really focused on clinical outcomes, improving employee satisfaction and delivering return on investment, because they're improving outcomes. we think that's the preponderance of the marketplace. that marketplace is continuing to make buying decisions that are consistent with the way the market is always purchased. and we feel really great about our capacity to win the vast majority of those -- opportunities that actually transact.
there's another component of the buying cycle that's always existed. that's been more price conscious, it's been more focused on finding low-cost solutions that are either entirely digitally oriented, or that offer less in terms of services, or perhaps where the companies are more capable or willing to take lower profit margins. in those situations, we think that those are the deals that will we have always in the past shown discipline around and haven't necessarily pursued and will continue to behave that way.
operator
thank you. i show our next question comes from the line of them stan berenshteyn from wells fargo. please go ahead.
stan berenshteyn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. maybe on the 20% intermediate growth guidance, how should we think about the different components of advocacy versus plushcare versus expert opinion, and within advocacy, maybe as an add on is the expectation for pmpm to be flat and membership to be the growth engine there, or is the expectation for pmpm to be somewhat under pressure, given the competitive dynamics you cited earlier?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, stan, this is steve, so on a long-term basis, think about that 20%, as of being pretty similar across the different business segments expert medical opinion and plushcare are smaller in terms of lower base right now. exactly plushcare we've called out as grown a bit -- faster than that. but think of it as not just membership within customers. but most -- the majority of our business today is direct to employers, and therefore, a lot of that growth is being projected upon new customer logos, as well as growth within those employer bases.
in terms of pmpms and where those are coming in, we talked a little bit about in the last call or two about case rate revenues on expert medical opinion, there's a bit of a dynamic there were some that book is transitioned to case rate off of a pmpm, but taking it all the way back to raj's point. we think customers who are looking at these services, particularly advocacy an expert medical team. as we bring them altogether, they want to understand roi in a market that's extremely crowded with whether it be small-point solutions or other customers that aren't able to warrant that roi the way that we do consistently. and by putting a portion of our fees at risk and having had the roi externally validated.
we think that's ultimately the differentiator of why customers do buy and why they renew at such high rates. and so, that all we leave all that together and look at the growth of the breadth of the pipeline to tell us that we think that 20% growth rate makes sense across the different offerings and capabilities.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
and maybe to the last part of that question, stan. we believe over time that those customers and that -- and now those customers represent the preponderance of the marketplace, are willing to pay for value. and, and that that value will represent consistently pmpm fees to what we've represented in the past.
operator
thank you. i show our next question comes from the line of [inaudible] from berenberg capital markets. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- berenberg bank -- analyst
hi this is brendan for doug, thank you for taking my question. my question is what particular types of clients are you seeing the most demand from for accolade 1 is it more converting existing customer to sphere. have you seen new client demand and what are like the typical sales cycles on this? thank you.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. we continue to see great interest and traction from our existing customer base as it relates to looking at accolade 1 and that's really where the preponderance of our focus has been. we look at new prospects and this goes to the one of the earlier questions as perhaps looking at either the platform value or some of the individual solutions, accolade care or accolade expert md as a reasonable landing points for new prospects who are potentially just beginning to explore the opportunities in terms of healthcare reinvention. because that market is growing so fast and each of those categories are demonstrating such demand we want to simplify those sales cycles and meet the customer where they'd like to be met.
so going all the way back to the beginning, accolade 1 is really we're seeing continued interest in the customer base where we're really focused.
operator
thank you. i show our next question comes from the line of david larsen from btig. please go ahead.
aaron corin -- btig -- analyst
hello, thank you for taking my question. this is aaron on for dave. few questions from my end. so first, i guess, what do you see as the largest long-term opportunity from your tricare pilot in terms of revenue? and then, my next question is how much cross selling are you seeing from accolade advocacy, care and expert md? and how much cross sell revenue are you factoring into your 2023 guidance? thank you.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
guidance, i'll let steve answer that question at the end. let me first address the cross sell up-sell opportunities. and remind me of your first question besides cross sell -- the tricare opportunity. so i'll start with tricare.
we'll go to cross sell upsell let's see steve logistic question on that. as it relates to tricare, i appreciate that question. there's, a couple of components to that story. there's first the renewal of the tricare select navigator program.
additionally, i think, a quarter or two ago, we announced that we'd actually expanded into a new pilot called the autism care demonstration, capacity to deliver services to military families who's who are wrestling with children on the spectrum, that service is in pilot today to a small population in the mountains region. and we expect that that has a significant opportunity to expand across the country and to have material population, incrementally. the government is today in the process of choosing a health plan for the t5 contract that selection will be happening this year, that selection should go into place on 1/1/23 or perhaps 1/1/24, we have teaming agreements with a number of the vendors who are bidding that t5 agreement. and those teaming agreements give us an opportunity to deliver innovation as a subcontractor, with those plants.
so those are some of the factors that we think, are a part of a really exciting opportunity for growth.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
and aaron, to pick up on your question about cross selling, here's how we think about that. if i remember on our last call, we talked about 40 customers 20, who had bought multiple offerings out of the gate from accolade, and then about 20 that we have sold in one direction or the other, but primarily selling expert medical opinion into the advocacy base. so if you think about that, as representing on the neighborhood of 6% or 7% of the base, right out of the gate, and this being our first full year on the selling season. we would expect that it will break through and then 10%-or-so range of our total book and grow that over time.
but -- so we what we're seeing now when we go to market, we go to market with all of the offerings. so oftentimes, we are either starting with advocacy and then displacing or adding on other those offerings or selling a bundle right out of the gate.
operator
thank you. i show we have time for one last question? last question comes from the line of cindy motz from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
cindy motz -- goldman sachs -- analyst
oh, hi. i just had one last one. so on thanks for referring me to the presentation too, because i actually hadn't seen it. so where you break out all the expense items and the long-term ebitda margins is 15% to 20%.
so long-term, i mean, can i assume that's like in the 20% by 2029/2030 or i mean, is that what you're thinking like, is achievable and i appreciate the breakout for the expense items and lines as well. but any color they would be great?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
and cindy, first of all, the growth rate of 20% then that that's an adjustment to what we've seen in the past, but the overall p&l concept and you see the opportunity into that 15% to 20%. yes, i would think of that as the longer-term profile. so kind of five years-plus is the right way to think about that. and over the next three years is the outlook that we provided today, getting to breakeven, and then steady progression beyond that out, several years out.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yes, i appreciate you calling that out. cindy, i think it's imperative to note that with our updated guidance today, we've really tried to place a premium on the idea that we're evaluating our adjusted ebitda loss and driving improved efficiency in the business to get to adjusted ebitda positive and in fiscal 2025.
operator
thank you. that concludes the q&a session. at this time, i'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the accolade fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, to mr.
todd friedman, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
todd friedman -- head of investor relations
thanks, operator. welcome everyone to our fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. with me on the call today are our chief executive officer, rajeev singh; and our chief financial officer, steve barnes. shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join us for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating accolade's performance. details on the relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. there are also slides that accompany this conference call that are available on the webcast. the slides will be available for download later following the call.
also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results for accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh. 
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and thank you all for joining us today. today's call marks an important inflection point for our company. we've delivered eight consecutive quarters about performance and a remarkable evolution of our business. by being competent in the environment we're operating in and executing accordingly.
today, we're stepping back to acknowledge that the macro environment -- this has an impact on our business. and no doubt every business in our sector and beyond. this requires operating with even more discipline as it relates to profitability and growth. it is with this changing macro environment in mind that we're adjusting our go forward forecasts today.
we make these adjustments having just completed a very strong fiscal year, where we dramatically expanded our footprint and exceeded our financial targets. and we see a go forward environment supported by the largest sales pipeline in the history of the company. while there are tailwinds that we're excited about. there are also headwinds.
as you may have inferred from our press release, our relationship with comcast will effectively end in december 2022. given that timing is not a significant impact to fy '23 revenues. however, combining that customer loss with a challenging macroeconomic environment is worthy of evaluation. accordingly, we're moderating our annual revenue growth rates to 20% over the midterm.
while reducing our adjusted ebitda loss on our path to profitability. we're adjusting our spin to align with the revised growth rate and now expect to achieve full year positive adjusted ebitda in fiscal 2025. this is not about being overly optimistic or unduly pessimistic, it is simply about being pragmatic and clear eyed about the road ahead. our updated forecasts are a reflection of that pragmatism.
more on all of those points later. for today's call will follow the following agenda. i'll quickly highlight the q4 and fy '22 results. and then, we'll talk about what we're seeing in the customer and competitive landscape and how the pipeline looks for the year.
then i'll give you a broad overview of the steps we're taking to position accolade for both near-term execution and long-term positioning to deliver against those growth and profitability goals. steve will then give you more information on the financial results. i'll talk in a minute about comcast and how we plan to adapt to the dynamics at play in our industry. but first i'll recap the successes we achieved in fiscal 2022.
first, i'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts and commitments of our employees who delivered four quarters of our performance in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. these teams brought together four organizations in accolade, 2ndmd, plushcare and healthreveal while maintaining exceptionally high satisfaction ratings across all those customer bases. we went public two years ago with 1,000 employees, 50 customers and $130 million in revenues. we exited fiscal 2022 with 2,300 employees, 600 customers and $310 million in revenue and $366 million in the bank.
accolade today is more durable, diversified and set up for long-term success than ever before. before going any further, let's address the head of our comcast relationship. first, let me express my appreciation to the team at comcast for being our founding customer. and for the visionary leadership that chose to reinvent the healthcare experience for their employees and their families by partnering with a company that at the time had no customers.
that was 12 years ago, and through multiple contract renewals and changes in their bid, including me joining as ceo almost seven years ago, comcast has been a great collaborator. it's important to note that so much has changed over the years. in fiscal 2018, when we had fewer than 20 customers, comcast represented 45% of our revenues. today, we've got more than 600 customers, and comcast represents less than 10% of revenue.
and next year, based on the economic structure of their current evaluation process, that percentage would have been materially smaller. our roster of fortune 500 clients is the envy of the industry. for good reason, customers of this nature oftentimes lead the way with innovation in healthcare because of their volume, buying power, and population size. additionally, our customer retention rates have been north of 95% for many years.
while this isolated event is disappointing, it is just that an isolated event. in many ways, the diversification of our revenue stream, offerings, and customer base, we're all in preparation for an event like this one. well, we're always sad to say goodbye to an old friend, we wish comcast the best of luck. with that, let's turn our attention to the future.
our conviction regarding our strategy, our offerings, and our company remains very strong. first, we're in the midst of an exceptionally strong demand environment. we're participating in more rfps across every market sector, including the middle market, enterprise and strategic and government sector than ever before. our performance early in the selling season has been strong.
building off that point, we're in the midst of tricare select navigator program for the third year of the pilot. year one of the pilot resulted in us achieving a majority of our performance incentives and we expect our results in year two to be equally strong. importantly, we're well-positioned to grow in other areas of the tricare program as well, such as our early success with the autism care demonstration. second, our offerings are differentiated and compelling.
accolade is a personalized healthcare company that combines the strength of an advocacy platform with clinical capabilities like primary care, mental health support, and expert medical opinion. those capabilities increasingly tightly integrated, create a data-driven personal and value based healthcare solutions that healthcare buyers need. our customers and prospects agree, as our new sales and cross selling momentum remain strong. the utilization of primary care and mental health or expert medical opinion capability is exceptional when delivered in an integrated fashion.
importantly, we've replaced our competition in those categories and a number of existing advocacy customers or customers we're keen to work with their proven front door to healthcare for services of this nature. additionally, this broader portfolio is more interesting to help plan reseller partners who wants to take accolades capability to their member base. this month, we announced a partnership with priority health and michigan who's incorporating advocacy, primary care and mental health into their offerings. much as we already have in place for accolade expert md, we see health plans as a key distribution partner for accolade care.
third, our ability to address the inequity in healthcare makes our solution essential for employers where healthcare has fallen dramatically short is it providing care to those who don't have easy access to it. those impediments could be related to geography or social or economic factors. we're leveraging our deep customer relationships, clinical data, and expertise and machine learning to narrow those gaps. finally, our disciplined approach to building our business will differentiate us in uneven economic times.
our cash position provides the foundation to execute on our strategy. and our commitment on delivering -- and our commitment to delivering on our path to profitability is even further strengthened in our outlook today. i raised this point to address the challenge -- the changing macroeconomic environment and competitive behavior that we believe is not sustainable for the long term. our success over the years has attracted our fair share of competition, and our win rate has remained very high.
that said more recently, we've seen some of our competition begin to lower prices to levels where we believe they must either sacrifice fiscal discipline or quality delivery to members. in the end, strong businesses with a commitment to operating with discipline survive and thrive in environments like these. and we're positioning ourselves today to do exactly that. to that end, while the vast majority of our pipeline is made up of companies evaluating advocacy and personalized healthcare for the first time, we also have a meaningful number of prospects who previously chose a lower cost, lower engagement competitor years ago, and has now reopened rfps after coming to the realization that low cost, low engagement solution did not produce the outcomes experience and roi desired.
now i want to revisit how our core principles shape our view on go forward guidance. our company has always been focused on creating a new category of healthcare solutions that put people at the center of the service. and today our personalized healthcare solutions are doing just that for more than 10 million people. we've been focused on growing our business on the top line, while progressively improving profitability each year.
that commitment has been unwavering since we went public in 2020. that said as an operating team we are also committed to confronting the facts in a changing market. we believe it's smart business to moderate our growth expectations for the year. at the same time, we think fiscal discipline is important and are also reducing the adjusted ebitda loss for fy '23 and fy '24 from our previous guidance.
we expect to achieve positive adjusted ebitda for the full year in fy '25. our guiding principle in challenging environment is it to redouble our focus on execution and discipline. our addressable market is growing and our demand environment remains strong. with our focus on discipline and execution, we expect to emerge from this challenging environment, even further differentiated from the rest of the market.
with that, let me turn the call over to steve barnes, our chief financial officer.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
thanks, raj. first, i'm going to recap the results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 before providing more color on the changes in our fiscal '23 guidance. we generated $93.8 million of revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter ahead of the top end of our guidance representing 58% year-over-year growth on a gaap basis over the prior-year period. fiscal q4 adjusted gross margin was 54.4%, compared to 53.8% in the prior-year period, which reflects the positive revenue beat, as well as investments in staffing our frontline care team to support growth and integration.
adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 was $1.8 million, which compares to $2.7 million in the prior-year fourth fiscal quarter. this was significantly ahead of our guidance, primarily due to the revenue beat, as well as low versus lower spending and plan in the quarter in some areas such as hiring and personnel costs. for the full year, this rolls up to revenue of $310 million an 82% increase over last year on a gaap basis, and 30% on a pro forma basis adjusting for the acquisitions. adjusted gross margin for the full year was 46.5%, compared to 45.6% in the prior year.
adjusted ebitda for fiscal year 2022 was a loss of $42.4 million were 13.7% of revenue, significantly better than our guidance and compared to a loss of $26.9 million, or 15.8% of revenue in the prior year. turning to the balance sheet cash and cash equivalents totaled $366 million at the end of the fiscal year, and accounts receivable dsos were in line with prior quarters at about 20 days revenue outstanding. finally, we had approximately 67.3 million shares of common stock outstanding as of february 28, 2022. this does not include the approximately $3.4 million aggregate shares related to the 2ndmd and plushcare earnouts which will be issued in the near term, resulting in 17.7 million shares outstanding on a pro forma basis.
and now, turning to guidance. we're updating our guidance today for fiscal year 2023, as well as our midterm outlook. we are now forecasting fiscal year 2023 revenue will be in the range of $350 million to $365 million. with an adjusted ebitda between $35 million and $40 million.
this represents revenue growth of approximately 15% of the midpoint and then adjusted ebitda loss of negative 10% to 11%. the change in the preliminary guidance we provided in january is primarily related to a few factors. first is the comcast contract which will end in december and reduce revenue in the fourth quarter by roughly $5 million. secondly, you'll recall in january we expected revenue, excuse me, we expected between $50 million number and $60 million of new business signs in fiscal 2022.
the final result came in closer to the middle of that range, and we ended fiscal 2022 with annual contract value of approximately $286 million. we have also included some reservation on the lower end of our guidance related to the tricare pilot. as a government program, the pilot requires annual reauthorization. and while we fully expect a pilot to be renewed for the third year, and we are bullish on other opportunities with the federal government, we haven't yet received the official authorization.
and the last factor relates to our comments about the macro and competitive environment. as we said, we're having a favorable start to the selling season and our pipeline is strong. but with what we're seeing in the market, we have moderated our expectations, and we'll give you ongoing color about the selling environment as the year progresses. as it relates to our midterm outlook, we are now forecasting 20% growth excluding the loss of comcast.
but as you look out the onset for '23 if you grow the business 20% ex-comcast, you will get to around $500 million in fiscal 2025 revenue. importantly, we remain committed to our goal of consistent progress toward profitability. the loss of a more mature large customer like comcast will impact gross margin. while we won't try to recoup the entire gross margin loss at once, particularly in fiscal '24 when the impact is greater, we are adjusting our spend and now project positive adjusted ebitda in fiscal 2025.
one last note about spending in fiscal 2023. like all of you we see what's happening in the stock market, while at the same time are focused on employee recruiting and retention. to that end, we are incorporating a stock component along with cash for our fiscal 2023 corporate bonus plan. aside from providing a lever to manage cash, it also provides a clear incentive for the team to execute against our strategy, and even further aligned with shareholders.
this will result in a bump stock based compensation of approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. now before we take your questions, i want to align my comments today with the remarks we made in our january call regarding the revenue growth breakdown and modeling the path to profitability. the revenue impact i've just described primarily impacts the core efficacy growth rate. the one caveat i'd add is that plushcare finished fiscal '22 stronger than expected but given the macroeconomic volatility, we haven't changed our internal estimates of that revenue in fiscal 2023.
and therefore, the implied growth rate is a bit lower than we set in january. while this update of framework results in a lower revenue target, we're adjusting our spend to improve our path toward positive adjusted ebitda on fiscal 2025. finally, allow me to take one more step back. while we had some difficult news to report today, this event has also given us the opportunity to take stock of accolade from a broader perspective.
two, three or four years ago, this kind of event would have had a much deeper impact on our business. we have built accolades through internal innovation and m&a for growth and durability. just compared to a year ago, our customer base is far more diversified. we have growth opportunities across multiple factors, our revenue mix it spread across different sources and structures.
and we are solving more complex, meaningful healthcare challenges. we went public to create the foundation for the business we are operating today. we continue to be confident about the future and the value we bring to our 600-plus customers and 10 million members, even as we make adjustments to our spend to align our near-term business objectives with our path to profitability. with that, we'll open the call to questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ryan daniels from william blair. your line is open.
ryan daniels -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on the strong start to the year and thanks for the question. i guess i want to ask one regarding the second opinion solutions. you mentioned that several times during your prepared comments in discussing the pipeline and the end market.
and it sounds like that's an area you're seeing some particular progress with displacements and new wins. so can you go into a little bit more detail about why you're seeing such strong performance both in regards to net new adds and then displacements in that business in particular? thanks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, ryan. i appreciate the question. first, you're absolutely correct. we're really excited about that part of our business and each of the respective product lines that we deliver to customers, which what we find really exciting about the expert medical opinion business really starts with the differentiated capability for the offering.
what we loved about the 2nd.md offering when we acquired the company back in march of last year was that it was a personalized service that ended with a video consult with a physician as opposed to other competitors who might be pushing people more into their local networks or to written consultations delivered later down the road. that differentiation is beginning to play itself out across both our health line distribution channels that are finding great value delivering that to their customers and our direct selling motion where our accolade reps who previously were just offering advocacy and now have three offerings to deliver can deliver an extra medical opinion service that's highly differentiated. and so that's where we're seeing it. in terms of the replacement cycles, i think what we're finding, ryan, that i think is particularly heartening for the future is customers are embracing this idea, the commonality of what we deliver across all of our services.
a personalized service with a human touch is data-driven. and fundamentally, it's built around building long-term human relationships. and because our speech of our services does that, we're finding our win rates are improving.

thank you. our next question will come from the line of glen santangelo from jefferies. your line is open.
glen santangelo -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. rajeev, i just wanted to sort of follow up with a very high-level question. i mean it seems last quarter, the message was you're seeing customers starting to pull back because of the peer recession, you were seeing an elongation of the sales cycle.
and now we sit here 90 days later and the environment certainly hasn't gotten better and maybe has deteriorated even a little bit more. and now the message is we have more rfps than ever before, and we're seeing record bookings this quarter. like what changed in the last quarter? and how much visibility do you think you have at this point when you look at the balance of the fiscal year, just given how much it seems things have just changed here recently?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
yep. glen, thank you for the question. i appreciate you being here. if you go back to what we talked about last quarter, maybe i'll amend a little bit of the characterization.
i think what we talked about last quarter was a look ahead at an uncertain economic environment, and i believe that it was prudent to at least account for the idea that the market may slow down. i think last quarter, we talked about the fact that we saw more rfps during that quarter than we had seen last year or the year before. and what we really needed to see was now that we've seen the white of their eyes, are those contracts going to close? are they going to continue to progress through the pipeline? so that's the way we characterized things last quarter. this quarter, i think what we're saying is, hey, you know what, it turns out.
we actually closed more business this quarter than we closed last time -- last year this time. it appears that those deals are actually going to progress and continue to close. and so i wouldn't say that things have dramatically changed. but just i would say instead, every single quarter, we learn more about how that economic environment is going to impact the buying cycles of our customers.
we think, and as i mentioned in the script, we think that what we're beginning to understand is that those customers are interested in managing healthcare costs and seem to be very interested in continuing to pursue advocacy, care and expert medical opinion evaluations. we count all of that as positive news in terms of the performance of the first quarter. and we're looking forward to how that plays out over the course of the second quarter as well.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of richard close from canaccord genuity. your line is open.
richard close -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yes. thanks for the questions. congratulations. steve, i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the raising of the lower end of the revenue range.
was that primarily you signed the tricare deal? and thus, you took the discount out that you applied previously?
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
hey, richard. thanks for the question. the signing of tricare contract certainly contributed to bringing up the bottom of the range by $5 million, but it wasn't only that. we had provided some of the aspects in there.
we're also seeing along the lines of what raj is saying is some positive momentum around new bookings that gives us good comfort there. we also saw in the revenue beat member counts continuing to hold up, which contributed to the member -- excuse me, the revenue beat this quarter and positive performance on pg. so giving us more confidence and visibility there to raising the midpoint while at the same time, maintaining some balance given the economic environment that raj was just speaking about in his comments.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of michael cherny from bank of america. your line is open.
michael cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon. i want to dive in, i think, a little bit as well on the competitive dynamics. you talked about the improved close rates, which is encouraging, not just for your business, but obviously the broader state of the market. but last quarter, another theme that you talked about as well was this dynamic of the low-cost provider, the offset between offering something that's more, i guess, cut down versus something else and that being a key component of the comcast loss in particular.
as you think about that elevated rfp activity you're seeing this quarter, how much of the pitch that's being asked for is tied to not only value but also where can we cut and squeeze you on price?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, mike. i think if you were to look over the course of one of the things we're most excited about the business is that over the last 18 months, our win rate has been very consistent, if not improving. that win rate has been -- has delivered with pricing that's been very consistent. and so as you look ahead, the market, first and foremost, is a market that's looking for, in a market, particularly in a downturn or a potential recession like we're seeing right now, customers are looking for reduced healthcare costs.
and what we see in the rfps that we're responding to today, and i mentioned it a bit in my prepared remarks, mike, that the rfps are very specific about the clinical outcomes they want to prescribe, about the needs that they're expecting to be filled by the vendors that they're asking to respond to their rfp. and then that comprehensiveness that we're seeing in those rfps, we think is a reflection of customers embracing the value proposition that accolade delivers to the market. and so yes, i think there are other segments of the market that may choose lower-cost solutions. i think the other good news there, mike, is we do have lower-cost solutions that are available to customers if they seek lighter touch services.
and so long story winded to a shorter answer for you, mike, we're really bullish on our prospects and the win rates that we're seeing with price points that are very consistent with what we delivered in the past.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of cindy motz from goldman sachs. your line is open.
cindy motz -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. i did -- i was hoping maybe, steve, you could give us some more segment information, if you would, like the breakout of the $85 million in revenue between the core, expert, and plushcare. and just on that, it sounds like expert is improving or it sounds like just from your comments, it sounds like it's going better.
but yes, just if you could give us any segment information. and then also to -- just on the onetime $3.5 million, i guess, nonrecurring this quarter. are we -- should we expect to see that as well throughout the year? is that going to continue like for a couple of quarters? any information is good. thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
cindy, why don't i start with the second question first. on those, the charge associated with the onetime cost that will hit in the second quarter, you'll see that next time and to be in the neighborhood of $3.5 million. on the first part, the breakdown of the business is about two-thirds associated with the advocacy business with the remaining third split between expert medical opinion and virtual primary care with the direct-to-consumer being a bit larger than the expert medical opinion. and we're seeing healthy growth rates certainly on the consumer business.
raj spoke about it earlier, the plushcare business continues to perform. year over year, the business is growing in the mid-30s in terms of growth rate. the expert medical opinion business, a couple of points here. number one, as raj mentioned earlier, new sales volume is very encouraging, continuing to see not only stand-alone expert medical opinion wins, we're seeing knockouts of competitors, and we're also seeing bundled deals sell, which, as you know, very importantly to our model is that we believe strongly very much a strategic thesis around both acquisitions, is that when we can leverage the advocacy base and the relationship with a member to get that member to their needs, whether it be an expert medical opinion, one of our ecosystem partners for a virtual primary care relationship, we're starting to see that flywheel turn and starting to see strong utilization there.
and so we're at second quarter in a row of positive sequential growth on expert medical opinion after some slowdown that we saw a couple of quarters ago. so some positive news there. the 10-q, by the way, cindy, with this information around pro forma, information will be filed tomorrow.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jonathan yong from credit suisse. your line is open.
jonathan yong -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so it sounds like new wins are coming in better than expected. i guess does this give you enhanced confidence in the outlook and the possibility of achieving profitability sooner rather than later? and just on these wins, do they have -- are smaller, cheaper competitors pulling back given the current funding environment and that may be helping? or are they actually still out there and now they're just not winning anymore? thanks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, jonathan. i'll try to hit both of those. steve, please jump in if you've got anything to add. i think in terms of the competitive landscape, it hasn't changed dramatically, jonathan.
i think what we've done, we've traditionally executed really well at enunciating our value proposition of a comprehensive solution that engages broad populations, deliver the personalized service that's human-based and that's data-driven population health approach. and when we do a great job of using that value proposition, our win rates are strong and customers buy that comprehensive value. so there's no dramatic change in the nature of the competitive landscape, nor of our traditional win rates. i think as it relates to profitability, we're -- i think steve said it really well in his script.
we're really comfortable with our guidance and our capacity to achieve the path that we've laid out moving forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of craig hettenbach from morgan stanley. you may begin.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. i had a question just on the ebitda guidance, which you've taken up the low end of revenue and you kind of maintained ebitda, do you view that as just kind of conservative sticking with that or any other elements to be aware of this year? and then as it relates to that, just on the back of the cost cuts, perhaps speaking to some of the confidence in terms of the path to profitability on the back of that.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, craig, for the question. so first of all, around the cost cuts, i would describe this as very much aligning the business post having done three acquisitions, finding synergies, putting -- aligning cost against the priorities of the business against the 20% growth rate, which had previously been 25%. so that's a bit more on how we think about the cost cuts.
as far as this year, bringing up the midpoint of the guidance by $2.5 million in keeping ebitda where it is, that just has to do with -- we're here at the end of the first quarter, we had a positive first quarter. we want to obviously see how things go over the next couple of quarters with selling season but have good confidence in that 10% or so ebitda loss and then that continued positive trajectory from here to breakeven and then adjusted ebitda and cash flow positive in about two years.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of jeff garro from piper sandler. your line is open.
jeff garro -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question i'll ask one more on the selling season. i'm just curious, how is activity differing across your different customer segments of strategic enterprise and mid-market? and how are the distribution relationships that you referenced, both the plan and consultant side, helping across those different segments?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. appreciate the question. i think in terms of segments, we saw transaction flows in each of those segments over the course of the first quarter. so we continue to see traction across -- ranging from the middle market all the way through strategic accounts, that's point one, and we expect that traction to continue into q2 and beyond.
one of the things we're most excited about is as the company has diversified its capabilities of reaching potential customers is the idea that our direct-to-employer business is no longer the only driver of value in the business. and so while we -- what i just mentioned, the diversification across those market segments is exciting, our diversification across distribution channels is also exciting. so we saw good traction in the first quarter with our health plan partners representing both our advocacy and emo businesses. and then in that quarter, jeff, and i mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we also saw it for the first time, our relationship with priority health in michigan to offer our primary care and mental health services to power their virtual-first plan design options.
so those developments help us both diversify our distribution strategy and grow the business.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david larsen from btig. your line is open.
david larsen -- btig -- analyst
hi. can you talk a little bit more about the tricare contract, assuming you're doing good work for them and they like to return that they're getting. but when will we hear about an expansion of that contract? and what is the total potential revenue contribution of that and when would it actually flow into your p&l? and would that be enough to offset the comcast drag that's going to really start to impact fiscal '24? thank you.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, dave. we're excited to be able to serve the dha for the third year of the pilot. and so i appreciate you bringing it up because it's a part of the business that we're really proud of. when you think about pilots in the government business, particularly around the defense health agency and tricare, think about pilots as things designed to test new innovations, prove them out, and to determine if a service like this can drive value.
that value in this particular pilot is manifest in cost reductions, improved clinical outcomes, and member satisfaction. remember on this particular pilot, we're serving members who spend more than $100,000 a year on healthcare or have multiple chronic conditions. and so we believe that by virtue of the government signing up for the third option year of the pilot that we're proving that this service can deliver value. we'll do so again in year three as we execute well.
and what happens when a government pilot goes well, and there's a great article, by the way, in military medicine newsletter that we're happy to share with you post this call, that speaks to how those pilots then turned into standard innovations that may be a part of the t5 bid, which is the bid the government is running right now to select their carriers across both regions of the government. we're particularly excited about that opportunity because as these pilot capabilities embed themselves into t5, we have teaming agreements signed with three of the four vendors who are bidding t5. so our opportunity to become the service delivery engine for this type of innovation and others is pretty unique and profound given the nature of our -- the breadth of our distribution partnerships. so how will that manifest in the p&l? dave, i think one of the great parts of the government is the huge opportunity that tricare and dha presents.
and one of the realities of dealing with entities of this size is that it takes time. and so the t5 bid is scheduled to be awarded this year. i think for those of you who know the government business really well, the bid will be awarded, and then there's a likelihood of appeals to the bid and appeals to the process. and so the current schedule is for t5 to deploy on january 1, 2023, and then those innovations -- excuse me, 2024, excuse me, is to deploy -- january 1, 2024, and then for these innovations to begin deploying at the midpoint of the year.
and so that's when you could expect some of these to start to manifest in new revenues. but we think what's important is that the target addressable market here is significant. our leadership role is material and our distribution strategy diversified.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of ryan macdonald from needham. your line is open.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, raj and steve. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. i want to talk about the employment environment. obviously, the labor market continues to evolve since even the last earnings call as labs continue to pick up.
i would just like to know to what extent you're seeing that within your customer base and what type of exposure you have there? and then what assumptions are you making in the forward guidance for the employment outlook at your customers? thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the question, ryan. one thing to remind everyone on the call is we're fortunate to have a highly diversified set of customers on the corporate side across many industries, none of which comprises a material amount. so we don't have any individual exposure per se to one particular industry that is material.
and what we saw in the first quarter is positive member growth within the book that frankly created some upside, which contributed to the revenue beat. we've modeled and assumed as we head into a difficult environment here is that that will moderate for the rest of the year. and so we're not assuming that, that kind of growth will continue in our guidance. and so -- so far, we're seeing positive activity there with respect to members, but we're cautious given the recessionary environment that we're in.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of stephanie davis from svb securities. you may begin.
stephanie davis -- svb securities -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. just given some of the positive tone in your prepared remarks, i'd be curious as to how the accolade sales pitch has evolved as we've seen enterprise benefits budgets take a bit of a turn. is there anything new driving the traction? is that different than before effectively? and as a follow-up to that, i'd love to be -- i'd be curious as to any change in preference toward the three offering gears and if you're seeing maybe a land and expand strategy grow as much as titan?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, stephanie, and thanks for being here. i think traditionally, accolade has done -- has landed the value proposition associated with return on investment and cost reduction in healthcare really well. i think over the last couple of years, i think we've expanded that value proposition very clearly as we expanded our suite into personalized healthcare. but we began to talk more and more not just about cost reduction, but also about clinical value, improving clinical outcomes, and about improving employee engagement and environment when that is really important.
candidly speaking, our employers leaning in heavier on cost reduction in an environment like this one where most hr departments and cfos are being asked to take a hard look at the bottom line. the answer to that is yes. and so i think we're leaning into a muscle that we've developed over the years, and that's fairly well developed in our sales force. in terms of offering mix, i think it's actually quite interesting.
well, we do see what we call our core offering continuing to grow in interest. we oftentimes continue to see that growth happening in what we call middle-market customers, customers who are actually seeking an improved service and seeking lower cost but don't have the capacity to disrupt their relationship with the carrier in terms of carve-outs. and so in that situation, it's less about cost of the solution and more about disruption associated with the carrier. and then finally -- and then while the traditional flagship offering is actually trending really well.
finally, i think this idea around land and expand goes beyond growing the advocacy offering from core to our traditional offering and it also includes the idea that we're doing well, taking advocacy customers and adding expert medical opinion and care to our offerings or to their suite of capabilities from accolade. and that manifests in the fact that more than -- at this point, about 10% of our members have more than one accolade offering in front of them.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of stan berenshteyn from wells fargo. your line is open.
stan berenshteyn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. maybe first continuing on what you were just talking about. you mentioned earlier the rfp process has really been focused on staffing ratios, performance guarantees.
i'm curious, are there any changes in the level of performing guarantees that you're offering customers versus maybe a year or two ago?
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, stan. i think it's a great one because i think it reflects on the increased value that we continue to innovate on and deliver for our customers. if you were to look at accolade five years ago, i think you might have seen performance guarantees that we're very focused on cost reduction, which we've always been very good at, a reliable, sustainable basis. but also areas that might be about benefits, adoption or engagement with other programs.
what we're starting to increasingly be able to deliver and therefore, promote and deliver to our customers, our clinical outcomes, the capacity to engage with clinical populations in a particular condition and drive improved scoring on those populations. and that's something that we're really excited about moving forward as we think it's differentiated and important.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of dev weerasuriya from berenberg. your line is open.
dev weerasuriya -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question. i want to just circle back to ebitda and the cadence of that just over the course of the year here. ebitda guidance didn't move much and it looks like there's going to be some more leverage in h2 here.
but how should we think about the cadence? i know you guys mentioned some cost-cutting measures. are those mostly done with? or are we going to see more of that to our h2 as well? and which lines do we think, when you look at the opex that you'll see more leverage over the course of the year and thereafter? and then i think there was a comment on pg revenue and the impact on the q2 guide. just clarifying that would be helpful as well. thank you.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure, dev. thanks for the question. so on ebitda, the charge that we mentioned will hit in the second quarter. and you'll see really the benefit of that in the second half.
so you'll see that, to your point, you'll see some of that dropping to the bottom line on the second half, which is where the impact will be. as far as the pg revenue, my comment there was that in q1, we had some timing of performance guarantee revenue that was high gross margin and included in our guidance previously. the point there was that it contributed to the gross margin outperformance versus prior year by about five points. there was an element in their contribution from that pg timing in q1.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of sandy draper from guggenheim. your line is open.
sandy draper -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thanks very much. i think my question just kind of answered but just to clarify, i heard you say in the prepared remarks, margin or product mix impacted the gross margins. was that purely due to the performance guarantees? or is there anything on plushcare versus expert md or the base business that, that mix actually contributed? or was it really just performance guarantees? so i just wanted to clarify that. thanks.
steve barnes -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, sandy. actually, i'm glad you raised that to clarify because the contribution there was from both the pg performance as well as the offering mix. for one, plushcare operated at higher gross margins than the broader business, which contributed this year and was not in the number last year given the timing of the acquisition.
so those were both really contributors to that outperformance.
operator
thank you. and i'm not showing any further questions in the queue. i'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for being here, and we look forward to updating everyone again in our q2 call.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the accolade first quarter 2023 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, todd friedman, senior vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
todd friedman -- investor relations
thanks, victor. welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. with me on the call today are our chief executive officer, rajeev singh; and our chief financial officer, steve barnes. shantanu nundy, our chief medical officer, will join for the question-and-answer portion of the call.
before turning the call over to rajeev, please note that we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating accolade's performance. details of relationship between these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and the reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that's posted on our website. also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results of accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on the call.
for additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the sec, all of which are available on our website. and with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, rajeev singh. raj? 
rajeev singh -- chief executive officer
thanks, todd, and thank you all for being here. the first few months of the new fiscal year provides useful insight about the year ahead. today, we'll share with you what we've seen thus far and provide our perspective on the market and accolade's opportunities. let me kick off with our financial performance for the quarter.
we came in above the high end of our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted ebitda. i'll leave it to steve to cover that good news in more detail in his section of the call. we close -- turning to the commercial employer space in the early selling season. here's what we've seen in the first quarter of our fiscal year.
we closed more new business in fiscal q1 and has been our historical precedent. among the new advocacy deals, we signed a large west coast university system that became a customer that further demonstrates our strength in the university vertical. additionally, both our direct selling channel and our health plan distribution partnerships continue to do very well in stand-alone expert medical opinion transactions. regarding upsell and cross-sell of our offerings, today, nearly 10% of our 10 million members are using more than one accolade solution, reflecting tremendous progress since adding our virtual care and expert medical opinion offerings last year.
we also replaced competitors in a number of fortune 100 companies in the expert medical opinion market. those wins include a warehouse retailer, financial services firm, and an insurance company. with these wins, more than 30% of the fortune 100 is using an accolade service today. most importantly, our pipeline for new business in the commercial segment remains very strong.
investors oftentimes have questions about how the downturn in the market or potential recession is impacting the buying behavior of commercial customers. two observations for us today. first, we're participating in more rfps than ever before. we just had a very strong q1 in terms of new bookings.
second, customers in this environment are more focused than ever on the rising cost of healthcare. this plays well to our solutions and our proven track record of consistently delivering cost savings over the course of a multiyear contract. now let's turn our attention to the health plan market. three years ago, accolade announced our first health plan partnership with humana, still a strong and valued partner.
since then, we've added partnerships via acquisitions, specifically partners like unitedhealthcare optum, aetna, blue cross blue shield of michigan, and bcbs massachusetts. in addition to our advocacy partnerships like humana and blue shield of california, we recently signed an advocacy and virtual primary care relationship with priority health of michigan. as it relates to our virtual primary care relationship, priority will be leveraging our virtual primary care and mental health offering to power their virtual first plan design. we expect to announce more virtual primary care partners in the months ahead.
at this point, we have health plan partners representing our advocacy, expert medical opinion, and primary care and mental health offerings to the market, and we expect to continue to grow our relationships and add new ones moving forward. performance in the health plan space in f q1 across all these vectors was good, especially in accolade expert md customer additions. via the health plan channel, we added a number of brand name customers in the retail, energy, and technology industries, highlighting the attractiveness of accolade expert md across sectors and employer profiles. our expert medical opinion service continues to be differentiated and is seeing strong win rates.
now looking at our government business. in fiscal q1, the defense health agency agreed to extend the tricare select navigator program for the third and final year of the pilot. with that news in hand, let's take a step back and look at the dha business as a whole. there are now two elements to that business.
first is the tricare select navigator business i just mentioned. as the dha makes a vendor selection for their carrier relationship later this year and what is referred to as the t5, we believe that the success of this pilot will lead to the dha looking for these types of capabilities as innovations from their selected vendor in t5. in that respect, we're very well-positioned with teaming relationships signed with three of the four companies bidding on t5. as with all things with an entity the size of the defense health agency, it will take time, but we continue to position ourselves well for this opportunity in the future.
the second part of our dha business is our work on the tricare autism care demonstration. as you can imagine, military families with children on the spectrum have unique needs. with our partnership with health net, our specialized nurses are now assisting those families. we see opportunity to expand this population over time.
and in aggregate, we see strong possibilities to continue to grow our overall government business. before we turn to a discussion on market dynamics and competitive landscape, let me give you a quick, brief cap of what we've covered. we have market-leading offerings in advocacy, expert medical opinion, and virtual primary care and mental health. collectively, a personalized healthcare suite.
and we have distribution channels through the government, direct-to-commercial clients, and through health plans. this diversified product and distribution strategy minimizes risk while with strong execution, maximizing upside. now let's discuss market landscape and competitive dynamics. our competitive win rate remains strong, and our pricing discipline in those transactions remains at historical levels.
it's important to note that in context, the buying -- that in the context of the buying dynamics of our industry, customers will often hire consultants who write detailed rfps that include such requirements as staffing ratios and performance guarantees. those customers are concerned with the quality, comprehensiveness, and value of the service, given it's a service that they will ultimately have to state their reputations on with every one of the employees in their business. those very same employers are wary of vendors who commit to delivering a less comprehensive service at cut-rate prices. all that said, our competitive differentiation for our personalized healthcare suite comes from our comprehensive approach to engage widely, our data-driven approach to population health and our personalized approach to delivering care and building relationships.
we're the best in the world in what we do, and our customers continue to show their willingness to pay for that value based on our closed deals and current pipeline. that differentiation and that success will continue to drive the 20% growth rate of our business moving forward. we're committed to building that growth while driving profitability and making consistent progress toward our long-term operating margin target of 15% to 20%. to that end, we took some actions across elements of the business since our last call to effectively reap the synergies from three acquisitions last year, among other things.
steve will talk more about that in his section of the call. finally, i'd like to spend a moment on our direct-to-consumer virtual primary care and mental health business. business is strategic to accolade for a number of reasons. and, of course, the first, the underlying tech stack and capabilities power our accolade care business in our b2b space.
it's also important to point out that the d2c business is a powerful growth and innovation engine for accolade. in fiscal q1, the business continued to perform well. given the performance of other players in the virtual care space, we often hear questions regarding the environment for our d2c business. in short, we continue to grow well in this space with attractive customer acquisition costs.
we attribute our performance in the business, which is differentiated from others to several factors. first, we are a primary care and mental health provider versus other companies' urgent care focused approach. this is particularly important because people who discovered our service for urgent care needs due to covid restrictions on office visits oftentimes enjoy the service so much that they embrace our primary care offering. other urgent care only focused players don't see that conversion.
beyond that, our long-term primary care relationships with our members lead to strong retention rates compared to other d2c players. one of the unique things about our service is that our physicians are required to practice with us the majority of their time, and a majority of our clinicians are full-time employees. thus, our consumers can choose a single doctor and build a long-lasting relationship. and finally, our collaborative care model that blends primary care with mental health is a more effective and scalable way to drive behavioral health visits while delivering better whole-person care for our consumers.
we'll continue to provide regular updates on our d2c business in the quarters ahead as it's core to our strategy moving forward. with that, i'll turn the call over to steve.

thanks, raj. good afternoon, everyone. first, i'll recap the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 before providing more color on the changes that raj mentioned earlier. we generated $85.5 million in revenue in the first fiscal quarter representing 44% year-over-year growth on a gaap basis over the prior-year period.
the year-ago first fiscal quarter is our last one that does not include results from plushcare as we completed the acquisition in june 2021. fiscal q1 adjusted gross margin was 45.6%, compared to 40.2% in the prior-year period, which reflects the positive revenue beat as well as some expected pg revenue timing that benefited gross margin and adjusted ebitda, in addition to a higher-margin offering mix. adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of fiscal '23 was a loss of $15.4 million, which compares to a loss of $12.8 million in the prior-year first fiscal quarter. this is ahead of our guidance primarily due to lower spending than planned in the quarter in some areas such as hiring and personnel costs.
you will also note that we recorded a gaap noncash goodwill impairment charge of just under $300 million during the first quarter. as you are certainly aware, it is standard to evaluate goodwill balances every quarter. one of the key metrics to analyze is market value, both of the parent company and the underlying acquired assets. the stock market decline over recent quarters led to our total market cap being below the value we paid for the acquisitions of 2nd.md and plushcare.
netpac made an academic exercise to work with our auditors to review the current valuation in comparison to goodwill balances. now turning to the balance sheet. cash and cash equivalents totaled $336 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter, and accounts receivable dsos were in line with prior quarters at about 23 days revenue outstanding. currently, we had approximately 69.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of may 31st, 2022, and that number bumped up to 71.2 million shares in june, reflecting the distribution of the vast majority of the shares related to the earn-out provisions for the 2nd.md and plushcare acquisitions.
now turning to forward guidance and how to think about our financial model progression toward breakeven. we're updating our guidance today for fiscal year 2023 and now forecast revenue will be in the range of $355 million to $365 million, representing growth of approximately 16% at the midpoint. we are maintaining our adjusted ebitda loss guidance between $35 million and $40 million, which excludes approximately $3.5 million of onetime costs associated with the actions that raj mentioned earlier, and i will describe in more detail in a moment. with respect to the fiscal second quarter, we are providing guidance today of revenue in the range of $80 million to $83.5 million and adjusted ebitda loss in the range of $18 million to $20 million, again, excluding onetime costs associated with the realignment noted earlier.
also, as mentioned earlier, q1 benefited from some expected timing of performance guarantee revenues, which is the primary driver for the sequential revenue change from q1 to the q2 guidance. now a few comments about the cost realignment mentioned earlier. last year, we completed the acquisitions of 2nd.md, plushcare, and healthreveal and grew our headcount from 1,400 employees to nearly 2,400 people. as we evaluated the economic environment within the context of our revised guidance, we undertook a strategic review of our business to make sure that we're operating at maximum efficiency with the ultimate goal of ensuring we have the foundation to deliver on our objective of 20% revenue growth and positive cash flow in two years.
with that review complete, we refocused several parts of the business in the second quarter. this resulted in a reduction of about 4% of our employee base and aligns our cost structure to achieve our business and financial objectives. importantly, we are intentional on our actions to not impact our frontline care teams. we are proud of the exceptional member experience, with nps scores of greater than 60 for advocacy and 90 for plushcare and expert md.
we expect to continue expanding our frontline care teams to support our existing and new customers. we've been focused on growing our business on the top line while progressively improving profitability each year. that commitment has been unwavering since we went public in 2020 and is only stronger today. with that, we are reiterating our objective of positive adjusted ebitda and cash flow in fiscal 2025, which aligns with calendar 2024, about two years from now.
our convertible bonds are not due for approximately four years. so at $336 million of cash on hand, we have more than adequate liquidity to achieve our financial plans without going back to the capital markets, placing us in a strong position to execute against our objectives. in short, we continue to believe passionately in the strength, depth, and breadth of our platform, the diversification of our offerings, revenue streams, and customer base, and that we have an engine built for growth and sustainability, which will ultimately drive significant positive cash flow. with that, we'd like to open the call to questions.
