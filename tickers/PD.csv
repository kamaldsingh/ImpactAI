christine cloonan
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss pagerduty's first-quarter fiscal 2022. with me on today's call are jennifer tejada, pagerduty's chairperson and chief executive officer; and howard wilson, our chief financial officer. statements made on this call include forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements represent our management's belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update these.
during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-gaap financial measures versus their closest gaap equivalents. for example, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures as a tool for comparison. a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in our earnings release.
further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. with that, i'll turn the call over to jennifer. 
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you, christine, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. what a difference a year has made for pagerduty. we're seeing industries, companies, and communities actively recovering after more than 15 months of hardship and uncertainty. we also recognize the effects of the pandemic continue to challenge many regions around the world.
yesterday, pagerduty, along with coalition partners, launched the go give one challenge to raise $5 million for international covid-19 vaccine distribution. we know the only way forward is together. at the same time, reopening trends, coupled with the ongoing tailwinds of digital acceleration, devops transformation, and cloud adoption, are directly benefiting pagerduty's business. the growth of hybrid work, the combination of remote and co-located work is emerging as a new tailwind for our business as companies build new muscle to manage the increased complexity of decentralized collaboration and geographically distributed work.
building off a strong close to fiscal 2021, we beat both our top and bottom-line guidance for the first quarter. year-over-year revenue growth was 28%, demonstrating the resilience of our business through the pandemic. total dollar-based net retention was 121%, and enterprise dollar-based net retention was above 125%. as we progress to a post-pandemic world, pagerduty is well-positioned as one of the few key platforms that cios and ctos are investing in for the future.
we are on a path to becoming a $1 billion leader, focused on modern digital operations. this success is a testament to the ingenuity of our customers, our users, our partners, and our employees. we deeply appreciate their trust, confidence, and dedication. in the last year, the world had to embrace new ways to work.
today, every company is a software company, managing a complex digital ecosystem. digital operations are now business operations with pagerduty as a central infrastructure for our customers. as a result, our deal sizes are growing. compared to the same period a year ago, the number of customers investing more than $1 million is up 55%, and customers investing more than $100,000 with us are up 32%.
the macro-environment and market landscape continued to move in our favor. we're deepening the trust and loyalty of our core developer users, while many customers expand the use of pagerduty for customer service and secops teams. our investment in aiops and automation enables teams to prevent unnecessary work and empowers our users to intelligently mobilize their teams in critical moments. these and other new capabilities provide unmatched real-time context and visibility around incidents.
our vision to move teams beyond the incident response toward proactive orchestration of their expertise, on time-sensitive, mission-critical challenges is fast becoming a reality. pagerduty is evolving into the leading ubiquitous platform for real-time work as users and teams apply our technology to a diverse and growing set of use cases across teams and functions throughout a business. our growth in enterprise reflects these advantages with average revenue per user in expansion transactions up approximately 40% over last year, returning to pre-pandemic levels. our capabilities fortify organizational resiliency.
just as over 70% of it decision-makers have named digital resiliency as a top priority for this year according to a recent idc survey. this is true across vertical industries where we've continued to see momentum, including financial services, software and internet, automotive, e-commerce, and more recently, healthcare and biotech. our freemium offering continues to drive new platform usage. new free and paid accounts on the platform grew by nearly 30%.
we saw particular strength in mid-market with new logos up 33% over last year and new users per logo at the highest point in three years. our land and expand flywheel continues to deliver growth with both disruptive innovators and industry leaders due to our thought leadership and credibility within the developer community. in q1, we added new enterprise customers, including albertsons, jaguar land rover, and truist financial; start-ups, drizly, lunchbox, and pony.ai became pagerduty customers this quarter as well. we expanded our relationship with customers, including bell canada, kpmg new zealand, and legal zoom.
it's especially encouraging to see our largest customers expand their investments in pagerduty at the fastest rate of all of our customer segments. total arr for customers investing over $1 million with us grew by 59% year over year and 13% quarter over quarter, demonstrating the significant expansion opportunity with existing customers as we expand across functions, managing different kinds of real-time work. several cryptocurrency companies now leverage pagerduty to ensure uptime and reliability of critical customer-facing services, apps, and transactions. for blockchain companies, uptime is money.
the world's latest -- the world's largest cryptocurrency business based in the u.s., etoro, based in the u.k., and malta's binance have all adopted our platform. they're using pagerduty to coordinate teams managing the urgent real-time work that ensures the viability of the world's newest currencies. these teams are decentralized and distributed. so they turn a pagerduty to streamline their incident response across the organization and move from reactive operations to preventative ones.
automotive is another emerging growth sector for pagerduty. one of the most admired automotive companies in the world is steadily expanding its reliance on our digital operations platform. we now support the critical customer-facing services delivered in vehicle and on app for this global 500 connected car company. as the company adopts full agile development across geographically diverse product and engineering teams, they leverage pagerduty to ensure a delightful customer experience.
last year, a fortune 500 auto parts company introduced contactless pickup across its 5,000 retail locations. riding a wave of increased demand, they rolled out a new mobile application and made multimillion-dollar investments in digital channels. as the company pivoted its business model, it shows pagerduty's platform, including event intelligence, to manage a small pilot with their cloud team to prioritize incident management. since then, the company has expanded multiple times across its cloud and central it teams, driving the projected annual return on investment of over 250%.
one of the largest freight rail lines in the u.s. adopted pagerduty in q1. this fortune 200 logo is using a new digital platform to manage the operations of 8,000 locomotives and 32,000 miles of railways. pagerduty is the real-time operations platform they've selected to empower their teams with full-service ownership.
our multiple engines for growth have served us well in expanding our footprint and gaining market share. international growth was robust in q1 with particular strength in emea. while extending our global reach, our focus on enterprise continues to pay off as we added new customers to the over 60% of fortune 100 and over 40% of fortune 500 companies that already rely on pagerduty. each of these businesses are undertaking their own journeys toward thriving in a digital-first world, and pagerduty is a critical part of that journey.
in addition to new logos, we're also expanding our reach across companies with new use cases identified and adopted by our users. the number of customer service users is up 41% year over year. during the quarter, we launched new features to the pagerduty for zendesk application, which now delivers real-time updates and visibility directly to agents within zendesk. this allows teams to proactively communicate with customers as soon as the service is impacted.
teams at doordash, netflix, and outsystems have all adopted our customer service offering this quarter. customers, including okta, cisco, and zscaler also expanded their customer service teams' use of pagerduty. product innovation and expansion is our most exciting growth engine, especially aiops, automation, and our integration ecosystem, which connects us as an operations hub to all things digital. we are seeing strong demand for our automation solution with rundeck now integrated into our global sales motion, enabling cross-selling.
pagerduty rundeck customers are able to solve problems through automation in real time, innovating faster while improving their margins. rundeck is performing well, landing new enterprise customers, including fortune 500 health information company and an international land with a large enterprise utility business based out of australia. we continue to see strong update -- uptake of pagerduty security offering as secops teams are confronted with ever-increasing phishing, malware, and ransomware attacks. one secops team at a large online education platform uses pagerduty to guard against more than 7,000 different phishing variants per month.
these teams now fully automate blacklist updates without the need for expert knowledge or admin access, significantly reducing enterprise risk while saving valuable time. arr for our digital operations platform increased 93% over last year, with arr for event intelligence growing 200% year over year. in the first quarter, we announced a number of features to build on the already powerful services in event intelligence, including next-generation service dependencies, providing context and visibility both upstream and downstream based on past incidents. pagerduty automatically advises operators on resolution next steps, saving time, and improving customer satisfaction.
our automated triggers, also new this quarter, automate tasks using custom actions that allow responders to orchestrate work across teams, reduce time spent -- reducing time spent on resolving incidents and improving service availability. during the quarter, we expanded our digital ecosystem. according to gartner, the domain-agnostic aiops platform is emerging as a stand-alone market, distinct from domain-centric platforms due to the flexibility of ingesting increasingly diverse data sets. pagerduty is domain agnostic and maintains the broadest ecosystem in the market with over 560 integrations.
these include new integrations with jfrog pipelines for change events, crowdstrike for secops, and monte carlo for data observability. these integrations demonstrate our scalability and extensibility and are a key reason why our customers choose us as a central infrastructure for their digital operations. our social impact, inclusion, diversity, and equity efforts across the company and community remain core to our culture and our success. this quarter, we contributed both time and money to advance equality for asian-american and pacific islanders.
we also celebrated black futures month led by the efforts of our array employee resource group. our social impact arm invested $1 million toward equitable covid-19 vaccine access and distribution, committing financial support alongside product credits and technical expertise. three of these grantees, international medical corps, trek medics international, and nexleaf analytics are already leveraging pagerduty's platform in their life-saving work. trek medics executive director said, ""it's clear we've got eyes out for us in both expected and unexpected places with pagerduty, making our systems more resilient."" for an organization where a resilient platform can make the difference in delivering time-critical care, it's exactly the type of impact we're proud to make.
in the quarter, we added 15 new impact customers. these nonprofit and mission-driven organizations work in lockstep with our time-critical health grantees and leverage pagerduty's platform in their life-saving work. a recent idc report cited pagerduty's commitment to social impact as setting an industry standard. we will continue to make this a pillar of our culture.
finally, we are looking forward to our annual pagerduty summit, which kicks off a little earlier this year on june 22. we're expecting more than 15,000 attendees from across the globe at this all-digital and free event. we're thrilled to welcome global thought leaders, including david solomon, the ceo of goldman sachs; clara shih, the ceo of service cloud at salesforce; armon dadgar, the co-founder and cto of hashicorp; and adam grant, best-selling author, host of the work-life podcast and leading organizational psychologists. over three days, we'll host conversations on the future of work, the future of business, and the future of pagerduty.
we're hosting a financial analyst day on june 24, where we will share more detail on our summit announcements as well as on our road map to becoming a $1 billion arr business. with that, i'll turn the call over to howard.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen. we started the year strong with results that exceeded the high end of our guidance and our momentum continues. the last three quarters of solid execution and robust business momentum gives us confidence that we can accelerate the top line while maintaining best-in-class gross margins and improve operating margins over the long term. revenue of $64 million grew 28% year over year, driven by strong expansion, particularly in the enterprise and mid-market, with customers adding users, adding new products, and upgrading to our digital operations plan.
we continue to see strong growth in software and technology, financial services, retail, media and entertainment, and telecommunications with above-average growth in healthcare, life sciences, and biotech. the transportation sector, negatively impacted by the pandemic, is showing evidence of recovery, but travel and hospitality seems to be taking longer. international revenue grew 38% year over year to a total 25% of our revenue. a major contributor to our growth is expansion within our existing customer base.
our emea region was particularly successful driving high rates of adoption of the digital operations plan this quarter. and we saw predictable user expansion in apj with one example being a large enterprise bank growing with pagerduty for the fourth consecutive quarter. as we continue to move upmarket, we see two strong trends. firstly, customers are moving toward longer-term contracts.
for the ninth consecutive quarter, the positive shift of month to month to annual contracts continued. annual contracts comprise 87% of our revenue versus 85% a year ago and 79% two years ago. our remaining performance obligations, which grew 52% versus the same period a year ago reflect momentum in multi-year deals. secondly, our average revenue per customer has increased for each of the last nine quarters.
our enterprise dollar-based net retention was once again above 125% with overall dollar-based net retention of 121%. as a reminder, for fiscal year 2022, we expect dollar-based net retention to vary by quarter in the range of 118% to 124%. trailing 12 months billings of 257 million grew 23% from a year ago. quarterly billings grew at a more modest 11% due to several large early renewals that were executed in q4, as we mentioned in prepared remarks last quarter.
as we previously said, we look at trading 12 months billings to eliminate some of the noise associated with the variable timing of renewals and co terms. we expect q2 billings growth to be between 25% and 35% and trailing 12 months billings ex in q2 to be at or above 27%. the number of companies on the platform, both paid and free, grew by close to 30% for the same period a year ago. although it's in its early stages, our free offering is creating a larger funnel for customer acquisition, and the conversion rates from free to paid are better than we expected.
the total paid customer growth increased 7% year over year, with solid performance in enterprise and mid-market. customers spending over $100,000 a year and customer spending over $1 million a year, grew by 32% and 55%, respectively, another proof point of our strength in enterprise and midmarkets. our non-gaap eps loss was $0.08, and our non-gaap operating margin was negative 9%, ahead of our q1 guide and ahead of consensus. non-gaap gross margin remained best-in-class above 85% for the quarter, consistent with our target range of 84% to 86%.
i will now turn to the detailed non-gaap financial results. for the quarter, our non-gaap operating expenses were $60 million compared to $47 million a year ago, primarily due to investments in our go-to-market strategy and product development. research and development expenses were $16 million or 24% of revenue compared to $13 million or 26% of revenue in the same period a year ago. r&d expenses are up 21% as we continue to invest in expanding our platform in the areas of aiops, automation, customer service, and our integration and workflow ecosystem.
we expect to grow our investment in r&d during this year. sales and marketing expenses were $32 million or 51% of revenue compared to $24 million or 49% of revenue in the prior year, up 33% year over year as we invested in go-to-market resources and marketing programs. we expect a noticeable increase in marketing expenses in q2 of this year as we move our user conference, pagerduty summit, which was typically held in q3, to the end of june. in addition, we launched a brand campaign, which will increase above-the-line advertising costs.
and we expect sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to be lower in the back half of the year. general and administrative expenses were $12 million for the quarter or 19% of revenue compared to $10 million or 20% of revenue in the prior year. we anticipate exiting the year with a low expense-to-revenue ratio for g&a. our q1 non-gaap operating loss was $6 million compared to a loss of $4 million in the same quarter last year.
our operating margin was negative 9% compared to negative 8% in q1 of 2021. our q1 net loss came in at $6 million, a net loss of $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $3 million, a net loss of $0.04 per share in the first quarter of last year. turning to the balance sheet. we ended the quarter with $557 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, with improvements in both operating and free cash flow.
operating cash flow was $2 million compared to negative $185,000 in the same quarter a year ago. free cash flow increased by nearly 90% to negative $350,000 in the first quarter, driven by improvements in working capital and the deferral of investments in new and existing offices. that said, we expect to dip in and out of positive operating cash flow during fy '22. in particular, for q2, with the increased spend in sales and marketing referenced earlier, interest payments on our convertible debt, and prior acquisition-related payments, we expect operating and free cash flow to be negative.
with increased sales and marketing spend to support the shift in timing for our user conference and brand campaign investments, we expect an increase in our operating loss in q2 and therefore, lower operating margin than q1. however, we expect our operating margin to improve in the back half of the year so we exit the year in line with our full-year guidance. turning now to guidance. for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $64.5 million to $66.5 million, which, at the midpoint, represents a 29% year-over-year growth rate.
non-gaap net loss per share in the range of $0.15 to $0.16, with basic shares outstanding of approximately 84 million. this implies a non-gaap operating loss margin in the range of 18% to 20%. for the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue of $267 million to $272 million, which, at the midpoint, represents a 26% year-over-year growth rate. non-gaap net loss per share of $0.36 to $0.42 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 84 million.
this implies a non-gaap operating loss margin of 10% to 12%. before i turn to q&a, i'd like to remind you of the tailwinds that drive our business. digital acceleration, cloud migration, and devops transformation are imperatives critical to our customers' success. pagerduty's platform plays a unique role at the center of these shifts, redefining workflow, moving teams from an old way to a new way of doing things.
our platform prevents unnecessary work through multiple levels of automation, creates unequal context across the customers' environments, and orchestrates work with precision. we reduce complexity, improve productivity and ensure top-line business outcomes. this gives me confidence that the momentum we've seen in the past three quarters is set to continue, and we are well-positioned to see sustained robust growth. as jen mentioned, we're excited to update you in more detail at our analyst day on june 24 and hope that you'll be able to join us at our summit conference earlier that week.
with that, i will open up the call for q&a.

operator
thank you so much, howard, and thank you to our analysts for joining us. [operator instructions] the first hand i see raised comes from chad bennett at craig-hallum. chad, we'll come to you.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. so howard, maybe just on -- not to harp too much or focus too much on billings, especially quarterly. but i do recall and you mentioned that you had some early renewals in the fourth quarter that probably elevated, right, fourth-quarter billings to some extent.
but just is there any way to quantify that impact, you know, whether the negative impact in the current quarter or normalize it over the last couple of quarters and what the billings growth rate would be?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
so chad, it's -- you know, we haven't specifically broken it down that way. you can see that our billings fluctuate from quarter to quarter. and as we had seen within q4, we did bring forward some of those and that did create the 41% growth rate in billings in q4. that's the reason why we look at the trailing 12 months and also why we decided to provide some guidance on where we see billings falling in each quarter.
so for q2, we see it falling within the range of 25% to 35% growth. and that's because we are dealing with, one, renewals that represent potential for billings; we have a co-term arrangement with our customers. that also means that there's some fluctuation. so it's hard to predict exactly which will co-term.
but when we look at the longer-term view, the trailing 12 months at the end of q2, we see that being at or above 27%. so that lines up more with the growth rates that we see from a revenue perspective.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
and then maybe one follow-up for me. just maybe for jennifer. so just on the secops and the contact center penetration and growth that you're seeing, i mean the user growth numbers are very robust. are those recall -- i don't recall if you've talked about in the past, but are those net new logos to pagerduty? or are they expansionary use cases within the base?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
you're on mute, jen.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
in some cases, those are new logos, but in most cases, it is expansion. the vast majority of our customers start out on a devops use case and then realize that they can leverage pagerduty's sort of platform for unstructured, real-time, mission-critical work in other areas. and customer service has become quite a natural adjacency. you may recall that last year in september at summit, we announced pagerduty for customer service as a separate sku and we've started to provide more product marketing and more education for customers around that, where historically adoption had been largely organic and kind of viral within accounts.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
thanks. thanks for providing the secondary metrics that you guys did behind both users and products. that was great. thanks.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
josh, who is our next -- who has our question? 
operator
thank you, howard. i see a hand up from matt stotler from william blair.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. yes, thank you for taking my questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
hey, matt.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
good to see you. so maybe a couple of higher-level questions. one, you talked about continued penetration of the installed base as being kind of a primary opportunity for growth going forward, and you gave some helpful examples, including that one in the previous answer there. how do you think about what overall penetration looks like in the installed base today? and what are your initiatives to kind of continue to recognize that opportunity over time?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
i think this is something we don't talk enough about the fact that we don't have a single customer that's sold out because, you know, we look at the ability to penetrate customers across their entire engineering workforce, which includes developers as well as it, then we see expansion into security teams and security operations centers, customer service, etc. and then we also see a lot of customers using us for use cases that we don't imagine in different parts of the organization. there's a large software company that uses us, for instance, in legal, a large financial services company that uses us for physical security, another software company that i know that uses us for managing the process of closing out commercial contracts at the end of the quarter. so as more and more of these use cases sort of develop across the organization, we see the tam expanding inside customers.
the other thing that i would say is developer headcount continues to grow. i mean despite some of the challenges we saw over the last year, as every company becomes a software company, we see more developers, more tech workers getting hired, and those are natural users for pagerduty. so there's even growth within headcount growth. so i think it's very early in terms of the penetration, even with our largest customers.
and you can see that in just the expansion rate of our customers that invest over $1 million in arr with us.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
right, right. that's helpful. and then maybe as a follow-up. you mentioned the automated triggers, which is relatively new, and automation is obviously a great opportunity for you to continue adding value for your customers.
so would love to get your thoughts on kind of what remains in terms of workflow automation opportunities to continue to drive that value forward?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
i think one of the things that's hard about incident response is that the work comes at you, it's unexpected. you can't plan for it. it tends to be unstructured. it tends to be a cross-functional teams and certain expertise across the business involved.
and we're very early in our automation journey, but we're leveraging the foundation of 12 years of proprietary data on people, on workflows, on events themselves. the multiyear investment we've made in event intelligence, which helps us consolidate and correlate the signals coming in, but then orchestrate, automatically orchestrate, our work to the right people within the organization. some of the new features that we've been talking about more recently are where we take learning in the platform from previous incidents and apply that in the second, in the moments that our customers need it when they're trying to solve a similar incident, including direction on what to do next. and that is sort of automagical to me, if you ask me.
and again, kind of the beginning of what we think of as safe self-healing, not just helping orchestrate what team should do, but doing some of that work for them through the assistance of some of the product technology we've tucked in with rundeck.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thanks, again.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thanks for showing up.
operator
ok. next, we'll go to keith weiss at morgan stanley.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i guess this is one for howard. and not to beat a dead horse but i'll beat it a little bit. the tone on the conference call is very positive.
it sounds like new customer initiatives are going very well. but some of that is offset in sort of metrics we look at like billings by sort of a weaker renewal base. is it a correct takeaway that sort of the new business side of the equation is strong, if you will, that's exceeding your expectations? and then i have a follow-up on sales strategy.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. so i mean the comment i would make is that we do have seasonality in terms of our renewals at the best of times. and q1 is typically our smallest quarter and q4 is our largest. so from a billings perspective, the available base is smaller.
and so that affects billings. and also because we have the pull forward, that was the other impact. so i would say that that's an important context when you think about billings. when we look at our business, though, our churn rates remained really low.
so our renewal rate is above 95%, right? so business is strong in terms of our existing base. if you look at our dollar-based net retention at 121%, we're clearly expanding. but then the new business additions are also tracking really well. so we're seeing strength in terms of new business, and that gives us the confidence, both in terms of our guidance, but also being prepared to give the kind of billings guidance that we are doing now.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. that sounds great. and then on -- i guess, on go-to-market.
you guys talked about some really good strength in terms of the customer service use cases and the security use cases. i was just wondering, how does that fit with it? i know you guys just made a big hire, timm hoyt, to head up global partners. how does that sort of align with the partner strategy? because it seems it would be a pretty natural kind of fit security operations, going with some of the security guys, customer service going guys like zendesk. how do those two fit together? any early indications on success in getting those partners to contribute a little bit more in new deals and deal generation?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
we think about our partnership ecosystem on a couple of levels, right? there is our technical ecosystem where we approach integration to this product. and that's allowed us to build this domain-agnostic kind of central independent hub of connections that allow us to really consume the signal from just about anything. so some of the early partnerships that were foundational for our secops offering or customer service offering started in the integration ecosystem. and then as we see those grow in popularity, they become more strategic partners.
and you've heard us talk about zendesk in the past, salesforce in the past. we mentioned crowdstrike today, etc.. so having timm on board allows us to lean into longer-term strategic and go-to-market partnerships there that build on top of the technical ecosystem that we have. and then we also look at the hyperscalers, the cloud providers.
and i think in the past, we've shared some of the momentum that we have with partners like aws where we think there's an opportunity not just to build product together and integrate really effectively into their cloud service environment, which helps customers as they're migrating to the cloud move much faster with significantly less risk, but it also -- you know, it evolves into potential go-to-market opportunities. so having timm here puts us in a position, i think, to really build on some of the go-to-market efforts that we have under way, and really start to build -- broaden our reach to the market as opposed to doing it all independently ourselves.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that sounds great. thank you so much, guys.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, keith.
operator
thank you. next, we'll hear from sterling auty with j.p. morgan.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
yeah. thanks a lot, guys. just one high-level question from my side. so you mentioned acceleration a couple of times.
what do you think is changing in the business fundamentals that has you positioned to be confident to talk about the possibility of accelerating the growth?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
it's a combination of the demand signal and the macro trends that we see. i mean we've always talked about digital transformation, devops transformation, and cloud adoption being long-term tailwinds for us. and our customers are very early in their journeys even if they've pulled forward projects that were expected to take multiple years. as the pandemic, you know, has sort of started to slow down and people are more in recovery, we've seen our customers making more strategic investments there.
in addition, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, hybrid work creates an additional layer of complexity, right? because your teams are now more distributed. you don't know who's where, when in the moment, etc. and so when time really matters, when you're having a route -- real-time issues, and by the way, there are more real-time issues in digital business than there are in brick-and-mortar business that time matters, then we think that is also a new tailwind for us. from an execution perspective, i'm really proud of what we've seen across all of our theaters and segments.
i mean if you look at enterprise, which is an area we've been focusing heavily on, we continue to build on our customer base within the fortune 100 and the fortune 500, adding new customers this quarter, on top of what was already a pretty strong metric, 60% of the fortune 100 and 40% of the fortune 500. and again, those customers are early. we know the tam inside those accounts from an expansion perspective is large. freemium is working really well in the start-up community.
it's removed all the friction for start-ups to continue to leverage pagerduty as part of their, you know, get up and going sort of toolkit from a devops perspective. and then lastly, we're executing well in the regions. emea performed exceptionally well this last quarter. international, in general, is growing.
so you're starting to see all of our growth engines kind of come together and sort of hum in a rhythm that we like to see.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
ok. derrick wood with cowen and co.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks. i wanted to ask on verticals, and it sounds like you're seeing nice recovery, but one area is travel, but still lagging maybe. can you talk about how much exposure you have there? and how much of a headwind that is? and i mean we're getting vaccinations, and i think travel is going to start picking up.
i mean do you think that's an area that could really start to improve looking at the next couple of quarters?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah --
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
it's -- go ahead, howard.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. yes. so derrick, you know, at the start of the pandemic, we did share like a quantification of affected industries at the time for us, which included travel and hospitality, transportation, and at that stage, energy. and that was like a 7% to 8% of our revenues.
so travel is a subset of that. we have seen a return now for two quarters in transportation. and travel is improving, but it's not at the level as it was a year ago. so we are seeing a positive trend.
so as those businesses start to come online, that will naturally generate a certain amount of demand for us as a company, but it hasn't represented a large portion stand-alone.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
and i would just add, derrick, when i look at the diversity of our customer base and the vertical opportunities, some of the things that i think are newer to our business, one, we're really seen over the last several quarters' success in highly regulated industries like financial services, where the barriers to entry for saas providers are higher. you have to demonstrate a level of resiliency and security, etc., and scale to be successful in those kinds of accounts. you know, we saw a number of new customers and expansions in healthcare and biotech, and other highly regulated industry. and then even logistics, i mentioned one of the u.s.'s largest freight railway lines, you wouldn't think of them as being a forward-thinking, digital-first company, but in fact, they're having to make that transformation right now.
and so some of those more industrial or highly regulated verticals are additive to our more well-known strengths in software and internet, retail, e-commerce, etc.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. that's great to hear. another question on go-to-market. i mean it sounds like you're seeing good strength in mid-market and premium conversion and enterprise.
but clearly, the enterprise is a bigger push for you guys. does that -- as you kind of work on bigger deals, have more top-down selling approaches, does that create more seasonality in the business toward back half? is it longer sales cycles? does it change the seasonal profile within a year for you guys?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
howard, do you want to take that?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so you're right in that the -- often when dealing with the enterprises, you can end up with a longer sales cycles, but the majority of our deals are still typically found and closed within a quarter, right, so even within the enterprise. so obviously, there are outliers, particularly in the highly regulated industries, those tend to take much longer, procurement cycles are longer.
so we don't see it as having a particular impact in terms of seasonality. what it does change is that those deals in the enterprise tend to be larger, right? so they tend to buy on a, call it, an initiative basis or for a particular deployment. so that means that they buy upfront of their requirements. so it takes a bit longer for them to get the licenses or the users deployed, which means that the time from the initial purchase to the expansion is a bit longer from what we would typically expect.
so that puts a bit of pressure on dollar-based net retention because our traditional model, which was largely driven by developers making small add-on purchases team by team, meant you had a steady set of expansions. this moves like the expansion events are to be less frequent, but tend to be larger.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
but i do think, when we look at enterprise and our focus in enterprise, one of the things it does point to is acceleration in the business because you're landing logos with much more expansion opportunity than, you know, as a percentage of the total mix than we had in the past. and i'd like to see some of these large organizations where the initial land might be larger, but the expansions are more strategic. they tend to be, you know, more widespread use cases, for instance.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, derrick.
operator
ok. and joining us by telephone, rob oliver with baird. rob? 
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks. can you guys hear me ok?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yes.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
we can.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. thanks. sorry to not fully participate in the party here.
but i appreciate your time. you know, jen, just a high-level question for you and then i had one follow-up. i mean you've really been kind of a thought leader throughout the pandemic on, you know, issues relating to work, you know, seeing you had multiple panels talking about work-life balance, work from home. and i know you have a pretty strong cadre of other silicon valley ceos, if not beyond silicon valley.
and i'm just curious, you know, when -- it seems like there's a lot of uncertainty right now about how exactly things are going to shake out. and i'm just curious as to what you're hearing as probably have your kind of finger on the pulse of this probably more than anyone, you know? where are people in terms of where employees are going to end up? and then i guess, more importantly, relative to your company, like -- are we in a position now where whether there's some pent-up demand likely as we do make decisions around hybrid and teams end up being split up?
christine cloonan
can we have the next speaker? 
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
go ahead, rob, i can hear you ok. 
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
yeah. that's my question. i'm just curious if -- you know, around pent-up demand and, you know, what your view is or what you're hearing relative to, you know, how work's shaking out with some of your contacts? and then i have a follow-up.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
i think it depends on the type of company. if you look at companies that already were significantly oriented around a digital business model, like saas, like software, internet, apps, etc., they're already used to digital environments. there's not a lot of pressure on teams to get back to the office, and those employees are demanding flexibility. you know, many employees have already moved to lakes and mountains and places outside of urban centers where they want to have the flexibility and the freedom to work where they want to work.
and at the same time, they want to be able to come together to collaborate with people, you know, on a regular basis and enjoy the sort of joy of being together. i think there are other industries that are pushing much harder to get people back in office out of necessity, manufacturing for environment, or some verticals out of culture that historically had more of a co-located culture. and what we're seeing is ceos are sort of running a number of experiments, you know, trying to figure out, does it make sense to require people to be back a few days in the office and only -- and with their team? or are they going to say, no, we're digital first and you can primarily work from remote locations and come in and meet your team four times a year? so i've seen just about every policy or concept on the continuum in terms of what that's going to look like. and i think there's still a lot to figure out through the north american summer and as children return to school and, you know, kids get back, whether or not employees will want to return to the workforce -- or to the workplace more regularly.
i don't think we know the answer to that yet. and i think people have sort of moved away from making big broad-reaching statements about it, sort of talking about some of the experiments that they're running. a few things i know for sure. flexibility is now a table stake.
if you can't give employees the flexibility and the choice of where they work, then you will not be competitive for the best employees in the market. second, the geographical barriers to great talent have been broken down as have the sort of barrier to change for employees to move from one place to the other. so you have to compete on your mission and your vision and the opportunity, but you do have the ability to go after talent in other locations. what that means in terms of pent-up demand potentially is more distributed teams, not less.
because it's actually easy when everybody is working the same way. when everybody is remote and everybody is one square, one box in the video conference, it's pretty predictable and reliable. when you've got some teams in the office, some teams at a co-working space, and some people at home, etc., how do you make sure the employee experience is equitable? how do you make sure that collaboration can happen on a timely basis? that's where i think we see this as a big tailwind and the big opportunity because the pure distribution of teams and not knowing where current experts are and how to get a hold of them, means you're going to become reliant on pagerduty for that orchestration.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful color. thanks. and then, you know, howard, i had one follow-up for you as well.
you talked about kind of the success on the freemium side and the conversion there. and then you guys also talked in your prepared remarks about rundeck and how you've been satisfied with rundeck and also just generally the growth of software developers, which is something we kind of different yet as an industry. but just curious if there's any patterns you're able to glean when you look at that freemium, you know, user base? obviously, you've got a much larger extended, you know, 60,000-plus user base of rundeck that's also nonpaying. and if there's anything you guys are seeing when you look at that to try to, you know -- as that becomes sort of more cohesive.
thanks.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, rob. i think the thing that's been fascinating to look at with our free offering is just how easy it's become for developers to start using the platform. so it seems strange that when we had an offering that i called the almost-free offering when people were paying, you know, $120 for a year for five users, that, that created a barrier. so when i look through the list of companies each week as we have more users on the free offering, it looks like a list of start-up companies, right? you can read through the list, you can tell from the name, some of the crazy names that these must all be start-ups, and a lot of them very clearly identified in tech.
so the thing that is interesting to us is just to see that the acknowledgment that developers had around pagerduty as being a key part of how they work, it's certainly manifesting itself in free. and so we feel very positive about that trend in terms of seeing that we actually have created more access. and for those early stage companies that are going to be the next big disruptive player, they're already pagerduty customers in a sense, and that's an important part of our competitive moat.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
thanks, again, guys.
operator
thank you. next, we'll hear from matt hedberg at rbc. matt?
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. hey, jen. hey, howard.
good to see both of you. you know, in the prepared remarks, you talked about strength in europe. and i know you guys fired up a new european data center earlier this year. curious on what drove the strength and how you think about potential growth in europe with an increased focus there?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
well, we actually launched data residency in europe. we do not have physical data centers.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i see.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
we are native cloud humans. we don't do those physical things. but, you know, some of the things that i think are happening in emea. one, the same trends that we see sweeping across north america in terms of distributed work, in terms of digital first, they're all happening in emea as well.
and we've been able to grow our capacity on the ground and i think grow our presence in that market, such that we've seen a really nice distribution of landing commercial customers, particularly in areas like food delivery, but also large european software companies. and we're really starting, i think, to get traction as a player of note in that market. strong leadership, very consistent performance, great access to talent, all of those things have been important. and at the same time, we see growth opportunities in places like germany where we have very small field on the ground but a lot of opportunity.
i mean i'm pretty excited about some of the strides that we're making in automotive, for instance, because i think that's an area of opportunity for us in places like germany. so we've also seen good performance in our apj team. and again, historically, that's been a very small team. so you're seeing us invest to try and expand into international quickly, and that's another -- one of those growth engines that i think is driving momentum and acceleration for the business.
and also, you know, when you start to see multiple theaters, like i said, really kicking into gear at the same time, that's one of the things that makes me very confident about our future and our ability to accelerate the business overall.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thanks for that. and then i guess, you know, sean scott's been with you guys for a little under half a year now and obviously coming from amazon. you know, i guess, you know, what do you think some of the bigger impacts that he might have on the business now that he's been there for a while? and how do you just kind of see, you know, that amazon effect rippling through your business?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, sean has been great. he's not even been with us for six months, but he's already helping to drive a lot of focus, particularly in areas around automation, aiops, and thinking about product-led growth, really thinking about the product experience. and the product experience for users is so important to us because it drives that viral mobile experience that allows teams across the organization to adopt us for use cases that we don't need to imagine.
so when i think about the ubiquity play, that's one of the areas where sean is really focusing. and at the same time, you know, he's used to running a multi-product bu organization. so we're executing well with rundeck. we're executing well with some of our newer product development areas.
and, you know, he's also really looking for a lot of talent. you know, there's a talent bench that we want to build in product to support our ability to continue to innovate very quickly over time. early days for him, and you'll have an opportunity to hear from him at analyst day, so you don't have to take my word for it.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good. a little teaser there. looking forward to that. thanks, everybody.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you. 
operator
ok. and it looks like we'll round out our group with kingsley crane from berenberg. kingsley, thank you for your patience. 
kingsley crane -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
i'd just like to ask one quick one. so when we think about pd as the central nervous system of the enterprise, there's a lot of companies that also like to think of themselves as that title. so longer term, i would like to hear more on the strategy for continuing to be that for enterprises and then how important automation with things like rundeck is to that?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
so, a couple of thoughts. one, in order for us to really help our customers manage and detect unstructured mission-critical work from anywhere, we have to have the broadest, most independent domain-agnostic ecosystem to pull from. and that is one of pagerduty's deep moats. when you think about the observability players that are sort of trying to nibble around the edges, maybe the cloud players, the ticketing systems, etc., what they're all trying to skate to where the puck is going, and i'll lean on our canadian heritage here, we invented the digital ops category.
we essentially invented the hockey game that these folks are trying to play in. so i really feel like we have a distant lead there, that by treating integrations, its product, they essentially become the gateway to workflow. but we're talking about workflow oriented around very time-sensitive work, has to get done quickly, have to orchestrate expertise very quickly because i used the quote earlier, uptime is money. it's millions of dollars that dissipate in, you know, in seconds when you don't get this right.
so i do think that we have a very good opportunity to lead as the center of the sort of digital ecosystem or lead as the digital nervous system for our customers, and we're seeing that. they're deploying us as critical infrastructure inside their businesses where we're integrated to hundreds of services within their business. that then enables us to open up another sort of mode or another, i think, very competitive defense, where we're able to build products and services around service dependencies and around more service management, service automation, full-service ownership in a way that other players are not able to do because they're not architected around both a cloud-native and hybrid service environment. they're often architected around people or the cmdb, etc.
so i think it puts us in a great position. but again, you know, something that we can talk more about at analyst day and at summit. generally speaking, though, kingsley, what i would say is our acceleration and some of the virality of our product comes through that ecosystem. it sort of starts with one person wanting to integrate pagerduty to a specific service and then they realize how easy it is to literally drag and drop to connect to multiple team members, multiple services and it grows from there.
and that virality, that ease of use, quick time to value is clearly one of the things driving momentum in our business.
kingsley crane -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so many great points. thanks for taking my question.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you. 
operator
ok. jennifer, that's back over to you for final comments. that rounds out the group today. 
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
well, i just want to say thank you to everybody who listened today. i hope you will join us at summit on june 22 and for our analyst day. we are thrilled with the momentum in the business. as i mentioned, we believe and are very confident that the business can accelerate on the back of these macro long-term tailwinds that we see.
and i'm especially proud of our team who have remained very resilient through an incredibly difficult time. and i just want to say thank you. thank you to our team and to our customers for continuing to partner with us and hold us to a high standard and help us to get better with every day.

2022-Q2,PD,2021-09-02 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
christine cloonan
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss pagerduty's second quarter and fiscal 2022. with me on today's call are jennifer tejada, pagerduty's chairperson and chief executive officer; and howard wilson, our chief financial officer. statements made on this call include forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include our growth prospects and future revenue, among others, and represent our management's belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update these.
during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-gaap financial measures versus their closest gaap equivalents. for example, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our gaap -- our non-gaap financial measures as a tool for comparison. a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in our earnings release.
further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. with that, i will turn the call over to jennifer. 
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
thank you, christine, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. q2 was an outstanding quarter for pagerduty, exceeding guidance and consensus for both top and bottom-line results. we continue to benefit from strong demand in enterprise and mid-market, covid tailwinds, a favorable competitive environment, and a positive response to our product innovation in automation, aiops, and customer service. i'm so proud of the acceleration we've delivered and especially grateful to our customers, partners, employees for their resilience and loyalty.
for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, rev growth accelerated to 33% year over year to $68 million, with trailing 12 months billings up 30%. total dollar-based net retention accelerated to 126% and enterprise dollar-based net retention accelerated again to reach 130%. as the world's greatest enterprises transform into digital leaders, pagerduty has become the operations cloud for the modern enterprise, demonstrating customer loyalty, durable growth, and progress in building leadership share in a growing total addressable market. as our customers leverage pagerduty across many new use cases, platform usage continues to accelerate with total year-on-year paid user growth up over 50%.
our solid top-line business was driven by accelerating demand for both our new automation offering and our comprehensive digital operations plan, especially in the enterprise and mid-market segments. to date, 15% of our mid-market and enterprise customers have attached digital ops, event intelligence, or automation. annual recurring revenue for our digital ops plan was up over 100% and now represents more than 20% of our total arr. customer spending more than $1 million with pagerduty are up 63% year over year.
the number of customers investing more than $500,000 of pagerduty is up 34%, and those investing more than $100,000 are up 36%. nearly 18,000 companies now run on pagerduty, including over 65% of the fortune 100 and over 45% of the fortune 500. within our largest customers, we still see significant room to grow both within and beyond engineering and it. pagerduty continues to focus on and influence the developer community in both large companies and start-ups.
while many others have and will attempt to enter our market, our competitive differentiation is stronger today than it has ever been, and we continue to innovate and extend our leadership. for over a decade, we've innovated on behalf of developers and their interest while delivering unmatched resilience at scale for large enterprises. our technology ecosystem, now over 600 integrations drawn, is supported by recent investments in automation and 12 years of proprietary data driving our machine learning models. these are deep, durable competitive advantages that have established loyalty with our large and growing customer base.
pagerduty has strengthened its position as the leading choice for the most disruptive founders. our start-up and small business segment performed exceptionally well after being impacted by covid uncertainty last year. in q2, smb annual recurring revenue for both new business and expansion came in well above pre-covid levels. while the pandemic continues to disrupt organizational plans, adaptability, flexibility, and proactive operations have become core business imperatives.
pagerduty is essential infrastructure for managing increasing complexity in the service of customer experiences. and while nothing is certain, we expect post-pandemic benefits, including the builder economy and headcount growth to continue to fuel our momentum. across our annual summit and investor day in june, we highlighted pagerduty's original total addressable market, starting with the $25 billion tam for on-call automation, incident management, and devops. our entrance into the broader automation market has expanded that tam to $36 billion.
this significant investment in automation capabilities has fueled our growth along with customer service, security operations, and aiops and enabled our customers to apply our platform to an even more diverse set of use cases. q2 provided more evidence that the trends driving pagerduty's success continue to accelerate. companies are moving to a digital-first orientation to match the needs and expectations of their customers. this evolution is a multiyear effort for most large companies, even with the acceleration we saw during the pandemic.
we measure this transition for our customers using an operational maturity framework. simply put, operational maturity determines an organization's readiness and ability to shift from reactive mode to proactive and increasingly predictive operations. most large organizations start on the far left with central it op centers standing at the ready to react and to manually manage issues as they arise. the most innovative and operationally mature companies identify patterns through automation, predicting potential issues and then leveraging teams to prevent these issues from impacting their customers and business.
the vast majority of enterprises are very early in this journey, creating a long runway for growth for pagerduty. our tam now includes both upstream and downstream automation within and beyond incident management, allowing for an infinite number of critical work use cases. pagerduty's automation solution performed exceptionally well this quarter, with new unique customer lands like citigroup and specsavers, and cross-sales into existing pagerduty customers, fedex, discovery, netflix, bose, and one of the largest communication companies in the world. we added over 250 net new paying customers to our platform in the corner -- in the quarter.
our free offering has reduced friction for customers in low-value segments. and while this has impacted the total paid customer growth rate, it has expanded total companies on our platform by nearly 33% year over year and also has enabled us to shift our paid customer acquisition focus to much higher value mid-market and enterprise segments. new customers include a fortune 100 industrial company, greyhelm bus lines, and user testing, a late-stage private consumer insight start-up, which was also a win back from a competitor. during the quarter, thousands of our existing clients expanded their business pagerduty, including anheuser-busch, carvana, fedex, mastercard, tripactions, snowflake, and a fortune 200 fast food leader.
one of the three largest communications companies in the world has leveraged pagerduty for it and engineering and this quarter added automation to improve customer service for over 200 million visitors to their web app. in the first rollout, pagerduty automation reduced critical incident response from several hours to under an hour, which is projected to save the company millions in costs and revenue improvement. a fortune 200 asset manager expanded during q2 from a traditional incident response use case in engineering to implementation across data operations, site reliability engineering, and their central command center. this customer now leverages pagerduty to support 55,000 internal investment professionals.
regional expansion remains a terrific growth engine with significant upside for our team. international revenue grew 41% year over year, up from 38% last quarter, and now accounts for about a quarter of our total revenue. magnitude software in the netherlands, new zealand's kiwirail, are now both part of our customer base. we also added brazil's largest electronics and furniture retailer.
international expansions included a fortune 100 european-based multinational healthcare innovation company. bunnings group, australia and new zealand's leading retailer of home improvement and outdoor products, and one of canada's largest banks, scotiabank. in august, we appointed jill brennan to vice president of pagerduty's emea region. jill previously led the $3 billion hybrid cloud software group for ibm across 26 countries and was most recently the svp for emea sales at metadata.
accelerating a journey to operational maturity for our customers is the objective of our four strategic product pillars, highlighted at investor day by our chief product officer, sean scott. each of these pillars deliver flexibility, connect everyone, connect everything, and automate everything drives our product development. delivering flexibility means effectively orchestrating critical work in real time with a distributed workforce. the ability to assemble teams across devops, it, secops, and customer service is the only way to address critical issues that affect the customer experience.
this quarter, one of the world's most well-known fast food companies implemented pagerduty's digital operations plan to automate drive-through order taking, accelerate revenue and reduce customer wait times. modern enterprises demand flexibility and connection. cloudflare runs one of the world's largest networks to help make the internet faster, safer, and more reliable for millions of businesses. they are a longtime pagerduty customer with their entire engineering organization on the platform.
cloudflare adopted pagerduty for customer service, along with our sales force application, so now customer-facing teams can mobilize in real time. pagerduty for customer service connect service teams, those on the front lines of the customer experience with engineering teams in order to both address incidents quickly and communicate effectively to customers. this is just one more way pagerduty supports cloudflare's mission of helping to build a better internet. during the quarter, we published new capabilities to empower full-service ownership.
dynamic service graph enables our users to instantly map, visualize and act on business and technical service dependencies across their entire digital environment. pagerduty customers with service graph gain visibility into the health of their organizations, the ability to assess the impact of an incident and quickly identify probable causes, wheeling teams and data streams to derive insights that spur intelligent action. connecting everything means layering traditional observability and monitoring functions from diverse data sources, prioritizing the real-time actions that matter the most. our ecosystem of now over 600 active connectors is unmatched, enabling us to act as the central nervous system for our customers while making life easier for developers.
the combination of our domain agnostic approach to aiops, our technology ecosystem, and up and downstream automation positions us to be the operations cloud for modern enterprises. we continually expand our relationships with leading technology partners like cisco, who recently featured its partnership with pagerduty in times square. our event intelligence solution draws connections between the incidents that can interrupt business operations and their likely cause. here, we focus on speeding mean time to resolution, reducing interruptions, and delivering return on investments.
an idc study from earlier this year, calculated pagerduty's customers gain an average annual benefit of nearly $3.5 million per organization and almost 800% roi with a payback period of two months. our final product pillar is automate everything. we're reducing toil and further speeding response times by delivering intelligent automation that frees human experts to spend time innovating instead of responding. this quarter, the autonomous car unit of a fortune 50 automobile manufacturer deployed pagerduty automation.
previously, their small it ops team supported more than 2,500 employees. the group spent the majority of their time on it tickets and low-value activities. with pagerduty, they're projecting improved mean time to resolution, additional flexibility to meet global scalability needs, and projecting average return on investment of more than $0.25 million in year 1. we are very proud of our results for q2.
accelerating our growth to 33%, and we remain very confident in our momentum that it will continue as the market meets our leading product vision to be the operations cloud for modern enterprise. we also acknowledge many of the communities we work with still face the devastating impacts of covid and more recently, those from fires and weather. in july, pagerduty deployed $1 million in funding, product credits, and volunteer technical assistance to support organizations working to equitably deliver covid vaccines and vaccine education in underserved communities. we continue to build on our commitment to inclusion, diversity, and equity as a business foundation for pagerduty.
last week, we appointed our first chief diversity officer to our leadership team, roshan kindred. in early october, we will release our second annual id&e report, a transparent look at our employee composition, pay equity, and diversity initiatives. in summary, q2 was an inflection point for pagerduty, with our acceleration illustrating the durability of our growth, the long-term potential for our platform, and the legacy that we are building. pagerduty is ushering in a new operating model for the modern enterprise, one focused on predicting and proactively managing issues as they arrive; one that relies on automation versus people to detect and address critical work that drives business outcomes; one that requires a powerful combination of aiops and automation on a digital operations platform that is easy to use, fast to deploy, delivers payback in weeks; it's weeks, not years and delivers market-leading return on investment.
we've spent over a decade earning the trust of our users and our customers, something we seek to earn every day by ensuring their success. thank you to our incredibly talented dutonians who work very hard to make these results look easy. over to you, howard.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen. financial results for q2 demonstrate our success in building the operations cloud for modern enterprise. once again, pagerduty exceeded the high end of our guidance as top-line growth accelerated. our reliable execution in the face of the pandemic was bolstered by tailwinds, including cloud adoption, devops transformation, and digital acceleration.
and this gives us confidence in our plans to become a $1 billion saas company. revenue of $68 million, grew 33% year over year, driven by consistent execution in the enterprise and mid-market segments. new logos and familiar fortune 500 names added users to the platform, including abbott laboratories, s&p global, and booking holdings. we added a six-figure expansion deal with one of the world's largest airline carriers who are projecting higher developer productivity, accelerated migration to the cloud, and a six-month payback with a 449% roi as a result of using our platform.
pagerduty drives value across all verticals, but we continue to see strength within software and technology, financial services, and retail and wholesale. we also see continued new use case adoption across different teams with 12% of our paid customers using us for customer service and 20% using us for security use cases in addition to development or it. international revenue, one of our four levers of growth grew 41% year over year. international has grown from 23% of total revenue a year ago to nearly 25% this quarter.
as the macro trends of digital transformation, devops adoption, and cloud migration accelerate globally, companies in the international markets are using pagerduty to overhaul legacy and manual processes. some highlights in the quarter include a new 6-figure land in the emea region with a large media and broadcast company and a large six-figure multiyear deal in apj transacted through our partner, aws, with the royal automobile club of queensland, a 100-plus year of motoring advocacy group in australia. as we continue to gain share in enterprise and mid-market, we are seeing three underlying signals of strength. firstly, durability in our revenues with customers on term arrangements representing 87% of our revenue versus 86% a year ago and 80% two years ago.
second, our remaining performance obligations, which grew 45% versus the same period a year ago reflect momentum in multiyear deals. third, we are seeing customers predictively increase their investment in pagerduty. customers spending over $100,000 a year and customers spending over $500,000 a year, grew by 36% and 34%, respectively. and our average arr per customer increased again for the 18th consecutive quarter.
our dollar-based net retention increased to 126%, up 10 percentage points year over year and 5 percentage points quarter over quarter, and our enterprise dollar-based net retention increased to 130%. for fiscal year 2022, we expect total dollar-based net retention to vary by quarter in the range of 118% to 124%. trailing 12 months billings of $277 million grew 30% from a year ago and up 7 percentage points sequentially, making this the highest year-over-year growth since q1 of fy '21. quarterly billings increased 36% year over year.
however, as a reminder, we focus on trailing 12 months billings to eliminate some of the noise associated with the variable timing of renewals and co-terms. we expect q3 billings to grow between 25% and 35% and trading 12-month billings exiting q3 to be at or above 29%. the number of companies on the platform, both paid and free, grew by close to 33% from the same period a year ago. the conversion rates from free to paid continue to be better than expected, and the offering is creating a funnel for paid customer acquisition.
a few recent examples of conversions of the massachusetts port authority and oz minerals. they joined our platform through the freemium funnel and have converted to paying customers. i will now turn to the detailed non-gaap financial results. our eps loss was $0.13, and our operating margin was negative 15%, both ahead of our q2 guide and ahead of consensus.
gross margin remained best-in-class above 84% for the quarter, consistent with our target range of 84% to 86%. for the quarter, our operating expenses were $67 million, compared to $48 million a year ago primarily due to investments in sales and marketing, and product development. research and development expenses were $17 million or 25% of revenue, compared to $13 million or 26% of revenue in the same period a year ago. we continue to invest in expanding our platform, including the areas of aiops, automation, customer service, and our integration and workflow ecosystem.
sales and marketing expenses were $36 million or 53% of revenue, compared to $25 million or 48% of revenue in the prior year. as we discussed on our last call, marketing expenses increased in the quarter primarily due to our annual pagerduty summit, as well as the launch of our brand campaign. we expect sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to be lower in the remainder of the fiscal year. general and administrative expenses were $15 million for the quarter or 22% of revenue, compared to $10 million or 20% of revenue in the prior year.
this increase was a result of a one-time nonrecurring strategic consulting fee. we anticipate exiting the year with an expense to revenue ratio for g&a in the high teens. our q2 operating loss was $10 million, compared to a loss of $3 million in the same quarter last year. our operating margin was negative 15%, compared to negative 6% in q2 of fiscal 2021.
q2 net loss came in at $11 million, a net loss of $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $3 million and net loss of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of last year. turning to the balance sheet. we ended the quarter with $547 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. net cash used in operations was $12 million or negative 17% of revenue, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2 million or 4% of revenue in the same quarter a year ago.
free cash flow was negative $13 million or negative 19% of revenue, compared to $1 million or 3% of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. as a reminder, there were significant movements over q2 last year, which we previewed. we brought forward our largest pipeline generating event, pagerduty summit from q3 to q2, made the semi-annual interest payment on our convertible debt, and were impacted by timing of some payments for standard operational items in q2. turning now to our guidance.
for the third-quarter fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $69 million to $71 million, which at the midpoint represents a 30% year-over-year growth rate. non-gaap net loss per share in the range of $0.09 to $0.10 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 85 million. this implies a non-gaap operating margin in the range of negative 9% to negative 11%. for the full fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue of $273 million to $276 million, which at the midpoint represents a 29% year-over-year growth rate.
non-gaap net loss per share of $0.35 to $0.39 with basic shares out of approximately 84 million. this implies a non-gaap operating margin of negative 10% to negative 11%. we look to q3 and the rest of the year with confidence given our leadership position, the market demand, and the demonstrable value we deliver to our customers, as shown in this quarter's results. with that, i will open up the call for q&a.
christine cloonan
ok, wonderful. and we do have some hands up from our analysts already. as a reminder, folks, please raise your hand to be queued. and we had a request from bhavan suri from william blair to contribute first.
bhavan, if you'll go ahead and unmute. 
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you. can you hear me ok?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
yes.
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
perfect. hey, guys, congrats and especially congrats on the net dollar retention rate and the enterprise always fantastic. i guess i had a question around really the initiatives post covid, right? so we've gone through the pandemic, and now we look back, i'd love to understand how is pagerduty changed, forget the addition of the head of sales, etc. but where do you go from here? how do you think the challenges of the past year have impacted the opportunity and your go-to-market vis-a-vis what we've seen through that process? i'd love to think through strategically what's happened and how you rebalanced, rearchitected and how you think about going forward vis-a-vis the pandemic?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
sure. well, as i've mentioned in past calls, i think the pandemic accelerated a number of tailwinds that were already in pagerduty's favor. and we've talked about this digital transformation, devops cloud migration, all important. as the pandemic evolves because, unfortunately, it's not over yet.
i have a lot of empathy for people in many areas that are still unable to be vaccinated and dealing with the delta virus. i think the world and our customers have settled into what i would call a new normal. and that new normal is distributed work, it's hybrid work, and it's a heavy focus turning your business into a digital business, meeting consumers and customers wherever they are, right, whether that's in a physical location or on the curve where they're picking up goods and services or 100% online. and that kind of flexibility and need to adapt is another strong tailwind for pagerduty because it means all these companies are now putting digital transformation and that customer experience, managing incidents very quickly, so they don't impact businesses at the top of their priority list.
so we've seen a really strong buying signal to that extent.  for our company, we were already 20% distributed when the pandemic hit. we're now nearly 50% distributed. and i think also has settled into, i think, what is a really good motion seeing our business accelerate by being able to execute as a distributed team. and so i think our culture has really lent itself toward helping our business become more efficient, helping our people become more effective and yet still managing the human needs of our employees.
it's been a tough couple of years on everybody. mental health is important. physical health is important. in fact, my whole team and i are currently participating in a step challenge which is not going very well because i've been sitting in this chair all day.
but net-net, i would say, as you look at how i think this pandemic will evolve, we're seeing the hottest talent market i've seen in my career. that means a lot of employee mobility and historically, employee mobility has been good for pagerduty. when pagerduty users leave one company and go to the next, they often drag our services with them. i also think headcount growth has historically been a tailwind for pagerduty and could be good for us in the future.
i talked a little bit about operational maturity. and i think the thing we haven't articulated as well in the past, the point i wanted to make today is even with the acceleration, it takes large companies a long time to move from being entirely reactive and just trying to react faster to a really proactive stance for their leveraging machine learning and analytics to get out in front of and automate issues within their digital ecosystem. and that's the role that we're now playing. and i see a lot of growth and upside and runway for pagerduty as a result of that journey that we are working with customers on.
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
that's really helpful. and i appreciate the color. the other question that comes up a lot is competitive in pricing, and you have one competitor that is a low price still you have others. but i think on one, not naming names.
is there -- has there been any change in the competitive environment? this comes up all the time, and you might have all just addressed it. and has pricing impacted? are you thinking about pricing? what do you think about it? i'd love to just get honestly, with all the candid you can. what do you see, what are customers saying, and while they are saying some competitors are offering something that's substantially cheaper? and how do you view that opportunity or environment or win rates?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
thanks for the question, bhavan. candidly speaking, the market has been talking about competitors like some kaiser is -- pop up out of nowhere and kill pagerduty, and our growth has accelerated or --
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
from hungary, specifically from hungary. yes, yes, yes.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
and i will tell you that i have never been more confident in our competitive position, particularly as it relates to our product position, the success that we've had in enterprise, the loyalty of our enterprise customers. and the differentiation with which we go about helping customers not only modernize their it but increasingly automate their it and speed the ability for their companies to deliver on the brand experience and meet the needs of their customers. and we've done that by spending over a decade, building deep trust and credibility with developers and sres. and for devs, we are that superset platform that's essential deeply integrated into their infrastructure across observability, monitoring, logging, orchestration, etc.
and we're also very fast to deploy. compared to platforms that take months and years to deploy and cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars to deploy, we're fast and easy to deploy across the business, which is why you see us virally growing into new use cases. and in enterprise, because we are deeply integrated into those organizations, you're seeing our net dollar retention expand. so i'm very comfortable with our competitive position.
you see we've been able to maintain best-in-class gross margins. and frankly, i see pricing for us as a future lever. but like that is just one of many growth engines that we have in the business, and i'm confident in the durability of our growth regardless of what's happening in competitive landscape, which, to your point, has not changed dramatically.
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
no, i appreciate the candor. so i won't hold you to your saying you're going to increase prices. i'll let howard deal with that.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
you said that. i said it could --
bhavan suri -- william blair & company -- analyst
no, i know. thank you. i really appreciate the candor. and congratulations, those are really good numbers.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
thank you.
christine cloonan
ok. next, we have a request to go to mr. keith weiss at morgan stanley. keith, you can feel free to unmute, please.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you, guys. thank you for taking the question. and really nice quarter, really breaking out for pagerduty from my perspective.
i wanted to ask about the dollar-based net retention rate. and first half to jennifer, second half to howard. the solution portfolio has definitely expanded over the past year and further. what was it that caused that step function change in dollar-based net retention rate this quarter? was it just the products got to a level of maturity, the sales process has got in place to really effectively bring that to market? or are the customers just ready for this now? can you help us understand kind of what that catalyst was? because it was a really nice increase.
and the question to howard is why being such a debbie downer on the guidance? like why can't we sustain this 125% further into fy '22?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
ok. well, i'll start, and i'll let debbie downer take the second question. but i have to give howard a lot of credit. he is very disciplined and keeps me on a short lease.
so when we talk about net dollar retention, i think the things that are driving pagerduty's expansion are a combination of really seeing momentum in the cross-sell of our new products and services. we've talked about the growth of our digital operations platform being over 100% this quarter. we've seen really strong demand for automation and aiops, which i'm excited about. and we just launched our customer service offering a few quarters ago and seeing a lot of interest there as well.
so it's a combination of cross-sell, but also user expansion across new use cases. and not just use cases, we've built products more, but also use cases that our customers identify. and you can see that in our user growth, which was up over 50%. so we're starting to see that horizontal surface area growth across our customer base, which we've been talking about for many quarters and it's really just starting to manifest itself in the market.
and the last thing i'll mention is our teams are executing really well. like i am very proud of the way pagerduty's employees have come together despite a difficult environment, one that's filled with surprises seemingly all the time in the macro, just keeping their heads down and focusing on the things that are important to our customers, on championing our customers. so i think execution is a big part of it, and i'm just really proud of the team.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
and, keith, my comment is, obviously, 130% for enterprise dollar-based net retention and 126% of total was a great result, and we're very proud of that. but as you know, we do live in a world where it's hard to predict exactly which cohort will expand on which timeline. so we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given, saying that range of 118% to 124%, obviously, high for enterprise.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and just to be clear, are there any one-time items that occurred in q2 that you think aren't repeatable on a go-forward basis? or is it just more so conservatism on predicting the future?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
it's really just a case of which cohorts will expand at which point in time. so there was no specific unique events in q2.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much, howard.
christine cloonan
ok. thank you. next, we have mr. rob oliver with baird.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you, guys. appreciate it. jennifer, one for you, and then i had a follow-up for you, howard.
so, jen, i remember talking about maybe a year ago. and some of your peers in the public market were seeing already that inflection. and you guys weren't seeing it quite yet. and i remember you saying something along the lines of, well, companies sort of need to assess what's going on, and then they're going to turn to start to invest here.
and it really feels like that has come to fruition here with the inflection that you've called out. so just maybe to follow up on keith and bhavan's questions a little bit. i wanted to drill down a little bit further on that enterprise inflection. when you look at some of -- you guys broke out some of the data there, 20% of your customers taking security, i think, 12% doing customer service.
can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the most cross-sell within organizations? or is it really just the general pagerduty value proposition of, ""hey, enterprises have expanded their saas best-of-breed offerings a lot."" suddenly, they're sitting on sprawl, it's chaotic. they really need help. so can you talk about that where we are with kind of what the key drivers are in enterprise?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
well, let me first talk about my perspective from the market and spending time with customers. what i see in the market is our customers in a race to deliver great experiences for their end consumers. and those end consumers' patience is wearing very thin. they have lots of choices.
there are a lot of industries being disrupted. and customer service brand experience are paramount in the environment we're in where people are living and working in this hybrid way. and so we've seen things like how long it takes to acknowledge an issue, how long it takes to resolve an issue. we call that mean time to acknowledge, mean time to resolve, is now showing up in the ceo's office and an audit committee, how many instances do you have? how long did it take those incidents to be solved? so these have become really strategic initiatives and really strategic issues for business.
so that's part of it. i would also say that our customers are in a position now, now that they have settled into kind of, as i mentioned, this new normal to reengage in really strategic transformational initiatives. and what pagerduty does is change the way organizations operate, right? that's not a small undertaking. even though our product is easy to adopt and easy to deploy, there is a cultural shift that needs to take place.
and so that is also part of what's happening. the other thing i would say is we're a very horizontal offering, but we've demonstrated strength by acquiring and expanding customers in just about every major industry. so we've talked a lot about strength in financial services. this quarter, we saw strength in retail, and we started to see travel come back, for instance.
and we've also talked about how important it is for us to continue to influence the developer because developers inside large organizations are leading the way. and so our focus on the developer, on the developer's user experience is part of what's driving that new user growth. and then the last thing i probably should just mention around user growth is the fact that not only is incident response and incident management and, more broadly, operations becoming a business issue, not a technology issue. we're seeing more different types of leadership and people across businesses, businesspeople joining the platform, being part of, or wanting to observe what's happening when an incident is going on.
so we're also seeing an increase in users that are coming to us as we call them stakeholders, and that's helping to drive user growth.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
i would also just jump in there, jen, just to comment. the one thing we've seen, rob, not only the user expansion but also the attach of our new products. so our digital operations plan above 20% of our total arr. we saw outstanding growth in our event intelligence offering.
we're seeing excellent momentum with our automation offering. we're seeing now that of our enterprise mid-market customers like a 15% attach rate to that new product. so that's all i think testament to using pagerduty as a platform with the full breadth of our offering delivers the highest value. and for enterprise and mid-market customers, they're solving big problems.
they want the best most resilient solution, and no one can compete with us.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. yeah. that's helpful, howard. and, jen, thank you.
yes. and i think at the analyst day, you guys broke out, i think it was $200 million of the $1 billion target at the time, i think we were trying to figure that out. looks like you're on the road there, howard. and is that -- my last question was going to be on the variability in dollar-based net revenue retention.
and is that why, howard, is it because of we're going to see, i mean, the cadence of renewals, certain customers taking new products at certain times, co-terms, things like that, because it's a pretty wide range? thanks.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i think what i would say is from a context perspective, we have a lot of opportunity in our existing base, right? so our customers continue to expand with us. we see with roughly a third of our customers in enterprise expand with us each quarter. the difficulty is to know exactly by how much, they're going to expand with us each quarter and to be able to predict exactly which customers from that cohort will expand.
and that's why we've given that range and we've been consistent in providing that range. and you have noticed we've progressively increased in our dollar-based net retention each quarter since kind of our low point to now at a level that we think is industry-leading. we're in the top decile in terms of what we're doing. so we certainly are looking at it, but knowing that enterprise is going to be the big driver there and the performance there would be above that 118 to 124 in noi.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
thank you, guys, again. appreciate it.
christine cloonan
ok. wonderful. next, we're heading over to chad bennett. mr.
bennett with craig-hallum, i will bring you on. can you unmute? go ahead. thank you.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. can you hear me ok?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
yes. hi, chad.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
so not to steal anybody's thunder on the net expansion, net retention stuff, howard or jennifer. but howard, is it a big part of the acceleration just lopping off last july quarter of 116% and just getting that off the trailing. again, because -- and i view that as a positive, by the way, that now we can -- but isn't that a big part of it?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
i mean, if you had the mechanics of looking at how a number changes or evolves, yes, certainly, if your -- the baseline, your comparison is low, it certainly makes the compare easier. but if you look at the overall momentum in our business, which is showing up in the revenue and in the billings, you have to look at those things together, and that is why we are posting the strong dollar-based net retention. but also, why when we look at this, we know that there is some variability that exists from quarter to quarter.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
so just a follow-up on that, which, again, i view as a positive thing, and i've needle you a little bit more on raising the range for the year by a couple of hundred bps but that's just me. so i just think are we really -- i know you're seeing great cross-sell and upsell, both in terms of use cases, right, customer service and security but also in terms of products, in automation and intelligence and whatnot. but from a use case expansion standpoint, you're seeing increase in penetration. but i think it's still pretty early, right, in terms of the actual impact on the net expansion, whether it's 100 bps or what, am i correct in that? and do we have -- i mean, could we see significant acceleration just as these products become more of a needle mover in the revenue?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. jen, i don't know if you want to comment on that, and i can follow up. but yes, we are early.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
100%. we are very early. i mean, these are pretty nascent products. and like when i think about new products almost as small businesses and how happy would i be on the return of the investments that we're making for building a stand-alone business.
so for digital operations to be 20% of our total arr is just an outcome i'm thrilled with. and that also has kind of helped us build the muscle to become a multiproduct platform, which, by the way, that's a transition that's not easy when you're a saas company that has a single product moving to that multiproduct platform. and we've talked a lot about themes like bringing our 12 years of proprietary data to bear across different use cases, about continuing to keep our user experience simple and easy to drive easy onboarding and quick payback, and quick roi. and we're doing all those things while solving very complex problems in maintaining four nines of resiliency and reliability at a scale, serving the largest enterprises in the world, the biggest brands you've ever engaged with.
and so when you think about how the sausage gets made there, that is not easy. and i am actually thrilled about how we're managing through that transformation, and that's what's driving a lot of the momentum in our business. so i absolutely expect these new use cases and the products and services that support them and support our platform across use cases like apps and automation will become a more important part of our business over time, for sure. having said that, i just want to remind people that even on-call automation and incident response is still a very early market.
most of our lands are still greenfield. most of our customers we're serving just a handful of the employees in their business. and so when i look at just the expansion opportunity within our own customer base, i get very excited about that and see a lot of runway.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
so just one last thing. so it sounds like -- i know in the first half of the year, jennifer, you were unbelievably excited about and you were seeing the pipeline and what was transpiring and you knew the road map and introduction. but you made it a point on both calls or multiple calls of saying we're going to consistently target 30% plus growth on the top line. i assume you're sticking by that going forward.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
we are a company that tries to do what we say we are going to do. so, yes, i am. and that's all, howard will probably let me say -- i will say that in the quarter, we made big investments in marketing, particularly pulling our summit conference earlier into the year to build pipeline early in the year. and i'm really excited about the back half.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thanks much. nice job.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
thank you.
christine cloonan
great. we have mr. matt hedberg with rbc. matt, please go ahead.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question, guys. jen, you discussed i'm talking about the huge expansion opportunity in your base, but i can't help but wonder, you've had a lot of success with security and customer service. but if you look at other sort of opportunities in the organization. how do you think about like the finance department or hr? repeat a little bit.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
yeah. absolutely, it is. and part of that is a brand challenge, right so if you're watching cnbc, you'll be seeing pagerduty's first televised commercial, and we're doubling down on digital branding to help employees across the organization learn about how pagerduty can help them. it's not just about uptime, but you should expect to see us telling more stories about the different ways that pagerduty can be leveraged.
i'd also say that we have a lot of customers that use us in places like finance or legal or physical security, marketing, etc. and in fact, we have programs within pagerduty to get every team to use pagerduty for their business operations as opposed to just technical operations, secops, or customer service ops. so the goal of the long-term mission is to become the operations cloud for the modern enterprise, and that's across the organization. and by the way, i love your t-shirt.
for those of you who can't see matt, his t-shirt says, ""uneventful days are beautiful days,"" and has a lovely pagerduty logo on the back. that's one of my favorite.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. and i apologize if my video is a little bushy right now. and then, i guess, for howard, gross margins at 84% are within the range, but they are a little bit lower than what we've seen historically. anything to read into that just kind of being maybe the lower end of the historic range?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
i would say, matt, as we've spoken about previously, we were intentional about making investments, particularly around customer support and success to better serve our enterprise customers. so this has been a year where we have focused on how do we ensure that we can deliver the kind of experience that they need, which then supports our very high retention rate, very low churn, supports the high dollar-based net retention, and also helps get rid of some of the noise that we get around renewals and timing, which is like trombones going off and you get all that noise. but certainly, it's been really about trying to ensure, one, we can deliver the reliable service to our customers, but, two, that we're able to ensure that they're getting the best experience in using our product.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, guys.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
thank you.
christine cloonan
ok. a couple of our analysts looking forward to joining. we'll go to mr. rachit agrawal with j.p.
morgan. i will bring you up onto the stage.
rachit agrawal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys. this is rachit on for sterling. so i was wondering like can you give more colors on what's the uptake on the advanced modules?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
sorry, rachit, i think you asked what's the uptake on the -- on our newer products. is that correct?
rachit agrawal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, yeah. on the advanced modules, yes.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
howard, do you want to take that one?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure. so, rachit, our digital operations plan represents our most comprehensive offering in terms of it includes our event intelligence, machine learning-based product and our analytics, and a number of other features. so we track that very closely to understand to what extent we are gaining traction with that. that digital operations plan now represents more than 20% of our annual recurring revenue.
when we look at one of our other stand-alone products, ei, which is an add-on used by our customers, we saw that growing at over 100% this last quarter in terms of being able to -- in fact, it was close to 200% in terms of being able to the adoption of that. and our automation product is a product as well that is growing very rapidly. so those products are all part of customers being able to manage this operations cloud environment, making sure that they can manage their digital operations, most effectively. and if you put all those things together, you can manage all the way from the detection of an issue to remediation with ensuring that you're using machines to get as much of the work done and only having humans involved when you absolutely need to.
rachit agrawal -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. makes sense. and then can you give the colors on like how your hiring plans are going for the year where you --
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
yes. as i said, it's been a very hot talent market, and our recruiting team has been working on overdrive. but we are on hiring plan right now. and we're really trying to be thoughtful about making sure that in our speed to add headcount to the business, we also are making sure we hire the best people in the market and continue to build on the diverse and inclusive culture that we already have.
and so we're leveraging remote work very effectively. so almost all of our job specs are open in terms of location and also looking at other locations around the world that we can leverage to just reduce the impact of a very, very competitive talent market. but as i said, the mobility that we're seeing in employees across the globe also is potentially a tailwind for pagerduty as pagerduty users leave one company and go to the next and take pagerduty with them.

ok. and mr. kingsley crane from berenberg. we'd like to bring you on with the group.
kingsley crane -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi. can you hear me?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
hi, kingsley.
kingsley crane -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi, everyone. so in the past, we've seen some competitors move off pd and when they've released their own incident management solutions. so it's especially encouraging to see datadog expanding their usage this quarter. when you look across your customer base, are you seeing those two products compete or actually be deployed in tandem?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
no, they're generally deployed in tandem where observability is part of a superset of incoming signal that we then manage and consolidate and use machine learning to deploy the right signal and orchestrate the right team on the problem in the moment, and datadog has been a great partner.
kingsley crane -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
christine cloonan
ok. and we'll have a final call for any remaining questions. i don't see any remaining hands up. feel free to unmute and join the conversation if you have a question.
without any further questions, jen and howard, i'd love to turn it over to you for any final comments.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer and chair of the board
sure. well, i just want to say, one, thank you to everybody for joining us today on the call. and a big thank you and appreciation for all of our customers and our partners, including our technology ecosystem who really are the reason that we're here and we're only successful when our customers are successful. and lots of warm wishes to all of those who are not having such an easy time with everything that's going on with the fires and the floods and the pandemic.
to all of you, i wish you good health, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. thank you.

[audio gap] unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include our growth prospects and future revenue among others, and represent our management's belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update these. during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-gaap financial measures versus their closest gaap equivalents.
for example, other companies may calculate non-gaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures as a tool for comparison. a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in our earnings release. further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission. with that, i will turn the call over to jennifer.

thank you, christine, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. q3 was an outstanding quarter for pagerduty, delivering record revenue of $72 million, growing 33% year over year with continued momentum, especially in enterprise and mid-market. dollar-based net retention remained above 120% for the fourth consecutive quarter. our product, sales, and marketing teams delivered an outstanding quarter across the board, and i am especially appreciative to our customers who continue to demonstrate their trust and loyalty in pagerduty by expanding their relationships with us.
during the quarter, we increased our surface area across customers digital operations and demonstrated the value of pagerduty as the operations cloud for the modern enterprise. importantly, we drove a strong performance across all product lines, including incident response, aiops, automation, and saw landmark success with our customer service operations offering. pagerduty's digital operations cloud empowers enterprises to deliver superior customer experiences by providing intelligent incident response and operational automation that increase uptime, reduce costs, and improves customer satisfaction. as customers expand their use of pagerduty beyond devops, the platform tackles workflows across the enterprise and for multiple personas: technical, executive, back office or front office, wherever critical unstructured work arises.
this enables leaders to keep their teams focused on forward-looking innovation that drives and customer trust, and ultimately revenue and growth. we innovate successfully across use cases and departments. and as we do that, pagerduty grows from the foundation of digital infrastructure to enterprisewide operations cloud, a company's primary platform for engagement. our platform is seamless to deploy and purpose-built to manage the increasingly complex environments and time-critical challenges underpinning the digital economy.
in q3, we continue to grow both our foundational presence in devops and it and our functional use cases horizontally and vertically up to executive leadership. we successfully executed against the $36 billion total addressable market within our customer base and have created multiple engines for durable growth, as well as deepened our competitive moat. increasingly effective execution of our land and expand motion against strong demand from enterprise and mid-market, as well as a favorable competitive environment, saw third quarter financial results exceed the high-end of our guidance ranges and consensus with revenue for the quarter at a pagerduty record $72 million, and our non-gaap operating margin improving by 400 basis points over last year also ahead of guidance and consensus. in addition, new customers in the enterprise and mid-market segments grew 13% year over year during the quarter, and the number of customers spending more than $100,000 in arr with pagerduty grew 35% year over year.
with the backdrop of favorable macro conditions, including digital acceleration, the talent shortage requiring increased productivity, increasing cyber threats, and ongoing cloud migration trends, we are confident this momentum will continue and are, therefore, raising our top and bottom-line guidance for the full year. companies across all industries continue to adopt a digital-first outlook and invest to progress their digital operations with the software, retail, and financial services verticals, driving pagerduty's growth in q3. broad industry traction, almost immediate time to value, clear monetization of new products, and renewal rates above 95% form the foundation of our durable revenue growth as we scale. more than 19,000 free and paid customers, both the largest companies and the most disruptive start-ups in the world, now run on pagerduty.
the introduction of our free tier last year removed barriers to entry for start-ups and small businesses, while enabling our go-to-market teams to focus on high-value, mid-market, and enterprise customers. according to research, our recent survey -- according to research from a recent survey of global technology industry leaders, 72% indicate they're accelerating digital transformation in their organization. pagerduty helps customers address the challenges of digital acceleration by operationalizing customer trust. in q3 alone, two fortune 200 companies turned to pagerduty, a consumer financial services company that deployed our platform to drive standardization, and a public utility that introduced pagerduty to leverage automation for a better customer experience.
these clients predict roi between 400% and 650% within three years with payback periods as short as three months. in addition, a multibillion-dollar automotive technology company now relies on pagerduty to unify its incident management practices. time to value is a competitive advantage for pagerduty as the platform can be deployed within minutes due to ease of use and native interoperability with today's complex systems. through first-class apis, it connects to services across an enterprise's ecosystem immediately, providing visibility, workflows, insights, and automation that translate to value in days and weeks rather than years.
with more than 625 pre-built platform integrations, pagerduty quickly becomes embedded in and automates our customers' operational systems, workflows, software telemetry, and culture. and no other platform is more reliable, secure, and resilient at scale than pagerduty. enterprises trust pagerduty because we continually demonstrate increasing value and reliability, delivering rapid roi and earning the confidence of senior leaders. developers choose pagerduty because of our relentless focus on not only their organizations' goals but also the user experience that improves their quality of work and life.
over time, these have proven to be deep, sustainable, competitive moats for us. pagerduty has powered digital-first businesses for over a decade, freeing teams up to focus on innovating for their customers by accelerating and transforming their digital operations from reactive to proactive and preventative. by applying ai to harness both a deep understanding of human workflows and our rich proprietary data set combined with automation and event intelligence, pagerduty reduces both the volume of work and the time it takes to complete tasks. this quarter, we saw new customers such as burberry launch pagerduty to reduce response times to customer issues and improve the consumer experience.
in a digital-first economy, the way we work has changed permanently. now, mission-critical work is managed by teams distributed across geographies and time zones, underserved by traditional ticketing workflows. pagerduty uses machine learning to anticipate the needs of our customers and identifies, escalates, automates, and resolves critical issues for these businesses before customers, employees, or the businesses' reputation are impacted. this quarter, a fortune 50 global technology company expanded their relationship with pagerduty, adopting our customer service operations offering in an effort to continually improve the quality of their customer service and experience.
previously, the customer was unable to manage code red incidents effectively, leading to customer escalations that reached its senior executives. customer service leadership at the company chose pagerduty to help them improve service levels for premium customers. our pace of innovation continues to accelerate, with product teams launching new pagerduty applications for salesforce service cloud and datadog in the quarter. we kicked off q4 with our fall product launch, which extends our platform to include intelligent automation, injecting control and logic at the event layer.
pagerduty's new event orchestration differentiates our aiops offering, reducing manual processes to gain operational efficiencies, while our just-launched service standards enables account owners to enforce best practices at scale for all of their managed services. pagerduty automation can currently be deployed in a customer's environment and is also now available as a cloud service, providing the high availability, security, and scalability our customers expect from us. we now provide the only cloud-native platform that combines real-time incident response with time-critical aiops insights and automation to help enterprises more quickly realize their digital-first strategies. typically, our customer cohorts follow an adoption pattern that maps to a digital operation's maturity curve.
most organizations start by manually and reactively managing issues as they arise. the most mature companies predict and prevent issues before they even impact customers or the bottom line. most pagerduty customers are still early on this curve, providing a long runway for growth within our existing customer base. our platform accelerates the speed with which enterprises evolve their digital operations and as customers move up the curve from manual to reactive toward proactive and preventative, both their annual investment with pagerduty and their roi expand.
as our product expands virtually across use cases, pagerduty emerges as the operations cloud and a standard platform for engagement across the enterprise. guidewire, a nearly $10 billion technology platform that serves the property and casualty insurance industry, has been a pagerduty customer since 2013. in q3, guidewire expanded their use of event intelligence and deployed our customer service operations application for salesforce service cloud to support ongoing cloud migration efforts and to streamline operations in order to meet rising customer expectations. guidewire's customer and cloud operations organization needed a comprehensive and reliable system to manage their increasingly complex digital operations.
pagerduty is their central partner to detect and resolve issues before their customers experience them. today, 17 teams at guidewire, including the senior executive team, use pagerduty to centralize and integrate all of their monitoring tools, increased cross-team collaboration for time-sensitive incidents, and automate action on mission-critical items. this is a typical customer journey across our installed base. initial deployments rapidly demonstrate value, leading to expanded pagerduty across -- pagerduty use across multiple teams within the organization.
last week, we released pagerduty's second annual inclusion, diversity, and equity report. our company's commitment to equity remains unwavering as it's foundational to our values, part of our mission and culture, and embedded in our business strategy. we are more innovative, higher performing, and more successful when we reflect the diverse communities we serve. the report is a transparent account of our progress in building an equitable, diverse, and inclusive board, company, and culture, which we share both to hold ourselves to high standards and to hopefully inspire other companies in their own id&e journeys.
while i'm proud of some of the milestones we have achieved, like gender pay equity and one of the most diverse boards in the industry, we have more work to do and remain committed to leading the industry by example. finally, pagerduty is poised for a record revenue result in fy '22 with annual growth accelerating a $36 billion tam and a strong demand environment in front of us. we have an incredible team, terrific partners, and customers we admire. and while our results speak for themselves, i wanted to reiterate our vision, the mission we are on, and our purpose, which inspire our innovation and our drive to ensure our customers' success over the long term.
we envision an equitable world where we transform critical work so all teams can delight their customers and build trust. we're on a mission to revolutionize operations and build customer trust by anticipating the unexpected in an unpredictable world. and importantly, our greater purpose is to empower teams with the time and efficiency to build the future. trust is central in all of this, something we seek to earn every day.
and i want to thank our customers, our dutonians, our partners, and shareholders for placing their trust in us. with that, i'll turn the call over to howard, and i look forward to your questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen, and good day to everyone joining us. our financial results for q3 demonstrate our continued momentum and success in becoming the operations cloud for the modern enterprise. consistent execution in the enterprise and mid-market led to another strong quarter with revenue of $72 million, an increase of 33% year over year, and above the high-end of our guidance range. international revenue grew at 36%, and represents 24% of total revenues.
our high dollar-based net retention rate at 124% is driven by consistent user expansion, plan upgrades, and new product purchases. our rate of 124%, compared to 119% in the third quarter of last year, was at the high-end of the range that we guided to in our q2 call. we expect net dollar-based retention to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and are confident we will achieve at or above 120% in q4. we ended q3 with 14,486 paid customers, up 6% compared to a year ago.
as a result of focused targeting, our product innovation, and go-to-market efforts, we saw paid enterprise and mid-market customers up 13% year over year. in addition, the number of total companies on the platform exceeded 19,000 at the end of the quarter, up 29% compared to a year ago. you may recall when we introduced our free tier a year ago, our intention was to drive focus on higher-value logo acquisition in the enterprise and mid-market and remove barriers for entry in smb. this is working well as we see good growth in enterprise and mid-market and strong growth in overall companies on the platform, with a more efficient land motion for start-ups and smbs.
general strength and momentum in enterprise and upper mid-market continued in q2 as 543 customers achieved more than $100,000 of arr on pagerduty, up 35% compared to a year ago. the growth in this cohort represents both new logos and expansions. our digital operations plan, which bundles both our core and new offerings, including aiops that excludes automation, grew 65% year over year, representing approximately 22% of our total arr, up from 18% a year ago, demonstrating success in upsell and expansion in our customer base, especially in the enterprise and mid-market. for q3, our non-gaap gross margin remained best in class as we scaled at 85% within our target range of 84% to 86%.
and this demonstrates the efficiency of our infrastructure, our differentiated scalable resilient architecture, and programmatic approach to customer support and success. non-gaap operating income improved to a loss of $5 million, or 7% of revenue, compared to a loss of $5.9 million, or 11% of revenue in the same quarter last year. overall, our non-gaap net loss per share was $0.07, a penny better than $0.08 in the third quarter of last year. in terms of cash flow for the quarter, cash from operations was $3 million and free cash flow was $2 million.
we expect cash from operations and free cash flow to decline sequentially due to q4 outflows attributed to our employee stock purchase program of $5 million and the semiannual interest on our convertible debt of $2 million. free cash flow will also include san francisco-related leasehold improvement expenditures of approximately $1 million. turning to the balance sheet. we ended the quarter with $545 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $143 million, up 33% year over year. quarterly billings were $81 million, which was an increase of 34% year over year at the high end of the range we provided of 25% to 35%. as a reminder, in q4 of fy '21, total deferred revenue included a benefit of approximately $6 million from early renewals. this creates a tough comparison this year, as we anticipate these contracts to renew again in q4, and we do not foresee any early renewal benefits again this fiscal year.
given this, we expect that quarterly billings growth will be in the range of 20% to 25%. on a trailing 12 months basis, billings grew by 31% to $297 million, compared to a year ago. we expect trailing 12 months billings exiting the fourth quarter to grow at approximately 25%, compared to q4 of the prior fiscal year. turning now to our guidance.
for the fourth quarter fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $75.5 million to $76.5 million, representing a growth rate of 27% to 29%; non-gaap net loss per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.06 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 86 million. this implies a non-gaap operating margin in the range of negative four to negative six. for the full fiscal year 2022, we're increasing revenue guidance for the full year to $278.5 million to $279.5 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 31%. we expect non-gaap net loss per share of $0.33 to $0.34 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 84 million.
this implies a non-gaap operating margin of negative 9%.i want to thank our customers for their trust in us and our team for delivering continued momentum with a strong third quarter financial results, strengthening our position as the operations cloud for the modern enterprise. this underpins our confidence in continuing to deliver durable revenue growth. with that, i will open up the call for q&a.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
before you do that, howard, i was going to make some closing remarks if that's ok.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
so, very quickly, i just wanted to summarize. q3 was a terrific quarter with continued momentum, accelerating annual growth, and a confident outlook, driven by a positive macro environment, product innovation, and room to expand in our base, great execution by our teams. we have become the standard for incident response, providing a strong core business that we are building on top of -- that we're building new products and services on top of. and our business grows durably as we advance our position as the operations cloud for the modern enterprise.
with that, i will turn it over for questions. sorry about that.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen.

operator
excellent. thank you. we're going first to sterling auty with jpmorgan. sterling, go ahead, please.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. so, i think it was about this time last year, you talked about the freemium model, so just pricing in general. just curious, did you make any modifications at this point this year, and how are you thinking about that moving forward?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
well, the freemium model has continued to be a great learning and kind of growth opportunity for us as a business. you know, remember, our original goal was to make it easier for developers and the most disruptive start-ups to leverage pagerduty and build that into their infrastructure. and as you know, we have very strong retention. so, as those customers grow, it creates the opportunity for us to grow with them.
what that's done, by automating that part of the funnel, it's freed up resources to focus on more expansive mid-market and enterprise customers. and that's allowed us to, you know, learn more and more about how we can push our high-velocity motion upmarket, which has created some great efficiencies for us. so, we continue to learn, but we're really happy with how the free trial -- or how the free tier is working, alongside of our free trial, which converts our customers to paid as well.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
and then, howard, one follow-up for you, in terms of -- noticed the incremental operating margin, you know, the incremental operating leverage that you generated, not only in the quarter but also in the guidance for the fourth quarter, you know, is that purposeful, or where are you in kind of your hiring plans?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, sterling. it certainly is purposeful. we, in fact, have been doing really well in terms of hiring.
q3 was a record hiring quarter for us, which, of course, covered across the business, you know, engineering, sales, and other functions as well. but we have been looking at how do we deliver better efficiency in terms of sales and marketing and g&a. we're obviously always trying to keep our r&d expenditure around the 25% of revenue, which we expect to do within q4, but certainly been looking for efficiencies in the other two areas without compromise on the growth opportunity.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
make sense. thank you.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, sterling.
operator
thank you. we'll go to rob oliver with baird next.
shrenik kothari -- baird -- analyst
hey, this is shrenik kothari on for rob. he had a conflict, sorry. so, you announced the rundeck cloud and aws partnership a couple of weeks back. and so, just curious how rundeck is doing at the new logos? is that still a factor, or is it still kind of more expansions with existing accounts? so, i think that's a question for jen maybe.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thanks for the question. well, first of all, really excited about both the announcement of pagerduty automation available in a cloud offering. we think that opens up opportunities for customers that prefer to deploy through the cloud as opposed to in their own environment. and rundeck has continued to perform very well in terms of both new customer land and expansion.
i think most important, bringing automation into our platform alongside of incident response, aiops, and now customer service operations really makes the platform much more complete as a total operations cloud for a customer, and really differentiates the platform competitively. so, we're happy with how that is going. equally, i'm really thrilled with the way our partnership with aws has advanced. so, you know, we've historically worked with aws marketplace.
we've doubled down with them from a go-to-market perspective. customers can retire aws committed spend on pagerduty licenses. and now, the aws salesforce can also retire quota against pagerduty consumption. so, a great channel opportunity for us, and that's continued to be a very good relationship for us from both a product and a go-to-market perspective.
so, excited on both fronts.
shrenik kothari -- baird -- analyst
thanks, jen. really helpful. so, just a quick follow-up for howard here. so, i remember you mentioned that the expansion rate last quarter had some contribution from the joint customers from rundeck as well.
so, i just wanted to understand the dynamic there, like the nrr coming at the high end of the guide can unpack that a little bit vis-a-vis rundeck and comps?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, i think just for context, you know, rundeck remains -- like from a size perspective, it doesn't move the needle materially in terms of the dollar-based net retention. so, i think you have to see it in the context of our larger business, which is now, you know, over $300 million in arr. but certainly, the contribution is there, and we're seeing, you know, both the expansion with customers acquiring rundeck.
and one customer that comes to mind for me this quarter was zscaler, who had been a digital operations customer. and then added the automation -- pagerduty automation for rundeck into the mix for them so that they can broaden their footprint to be able to cover all the way from detection to order remediation in delivering like a good experience. so, we're definitely seeing that motion happening where the existing pagerduty customers are adding to their footprint with us by adding automation. but just in general, across the board, upgrading the plans, taking on the new products, and adding new users is contributing to that really strong dbnr.
shrenik kothari -- baird -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot, howard and jen. congrats again for the great quarter.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thank you.
operator
thank you. next, we'll be hearing from keith weiss at morgan stanley.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. very nice quarter, guys, and thanks for taking the question. i have one for jen and then one for howard. jen, you talked about a favorable competitive environment in the quarter.
does that denote anything has changed in the competitive environment, or is that more so a pagerduty comment that -- with sort of the product innovation you guys are putting out, you've expanded sort of the competitive gap, and then that's what you guys are benefiting from?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
well, we continue to see land be greenfield as we have in the past. and in fact, we've seen the competitive environment improve where -- because of the breadth of the platform we're not seeing as much discussion around other vendors because there isn't anybody that's bringing aiops and automation and incident response together. so, frankly, it's improved, and we're thrilled to see the investments that we've made, particularly in mid-market and enterprise from a product perspective payoff. and, again, you know, i think, it's an early and nascent market.
our customers still have a lot of work to do to support their digital-first sort of customer experiences, and i think pagerduty is the right platform, you know, at the right time to help them solve some of those new problems that they're experiencing.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. outstanding. and, howard, actually two questions for you. one is just a clarification.
can you just walk us through the pull-forward dynamics that you were talking about in terms of billings for q4? i just want to make sure that we're clear on that. 
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and are there any other kind of periods of pull-forward that we should be aware of? and then the actual -- that's just a clarification. the question is the durability of dollar-based net expansion. you've had multiple quarters of really good dollar-based net expansion. is the mid-120s, is that a more durable rate on a go-forward basis now?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
all right. so, i'll start with billings and then i'll come back to the dollar-based net retention. so, in terms of billings, the adjustment that i was referring to there was really around -- in q4 of last year, we had unusually high growth in billings for the quarter at 41%. and part of that was driven by $6 million of early renewals, which would have renewed in q1 of the next year.
obviously, those are going to renew in q4 of this year, so we don't have that same benefit. so, if i back out that $6 million and do a comparison on a trailing 12 months basis, in fact, we will exit the year at around 30% in terms of billings growth, so that was a pull forward. and we're not anticipating anything unusual like that is coming -- this quarter.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
and then on the dollar-based net retention, you know, 124% is a really strong result. and we think that for companies that's our size and scale, being able to deliver a sustainable 120% is best in class. and so, for us, we are focusing our efforts on maintaining that level. and this will be -- q4 will be our fifth quarter of being above 120%.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much, guys. great quarter.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, keith.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thanks, keith.
operator
ok, hearing next from chad bennett with craig-hallum.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
hey, chad.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey. so, i guess just on digital ops plan and how that performed relative to expectations in the quarter, it's still putting up really good growth, but obviously, you know, decelerated from doubling year over year last quarter to 65%, and i think as a percentage of arr at 22%, it's kind of been here. just kind of how did that perform, whether it's from a net new logo, sales standpoint, or from a net expansion standpoint? and how do you expect that probably, more importantly, to grow over the next year?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll take that, jen, and you can chime in. so, we are really happy with the performance of our digital operations plan. it ties in really closely with the long runway that we had with our customers.
in terms of -- as they progress through the different phases of digital operations maturity, the digital operations plan becomes a very natural fit to help them move to those more proactive and predictive approaches. so, for almost every customer that we have, there's this opportunity for them to expand by taking on the digital operations plan. so, we continue to see really good momentum with the digital operations plan. we had multiple upgrades on the digital operations plan within the core, the customers going from business to digital ops, as well as new lands.
so, there's good momentum there. we feel that represents 22% of our total arr, represents, you know, a real indication of product attach, if you like, and we expect to continue to see that perform well.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then -- i don't know. i'll give this a shot. but can you speak to enterprise net expansion in the quarter, howard, or if it was at 130% range or were like -- 
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, for this quarter, we decided just to focus in terms of our metrics to make sure that it was easier and clearer for people to focus on the overall view, which is the view that we've shared at the 124% range for the quarter.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then maybe last one if i could. so, we're up to almost 550 customers over 100,000 in acv, i guess you'd call it. obviously, you have a significant number of paid customers.
is there any reason to believe, you know, over the next couple of years that over $100,000 cohort, you know, it's been growing kind of mid-30%? it seems like we're still like first, second inning where that should grow at that growth rate for the next few years. is that too aggressive?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
so, what i would say is that we've seen a very steady increase every quarter, right? obviously, it's -- and that's been very predictable. it's part of our, you know, durable growth as a company is the fact that we continue to see customers moving through the cohorts. and, you know, we don't always share the numbers above 500k and above 1 million, but we see a similar pattern of customers making that progress. and so, again, it ties into the very long runway that we have with, you know, the majority of our customers to be able to continue to do that.
so, we don't anticipate that that would -- should suddenly change. we will continue to grow our customers and see that they'll continue to add products, add users take our more advanced offerings.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. thanks so much. nice job on the quarter.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, chad

thank you. next, we'll hear from derrick wood with cowen. derrick, if i could have you switch on your video?
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. great. thanks. good to see you, team pagerduty.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
hi, derrick
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
first one, for jen. i think you mentioned that you had a landmark quarter in customer service. could you just double click what was special about this quarter, you know, why you're seeing maybe adoption kicking into a new gear, and perhaps comment on what kind of early demand you're seeing with the salesforce offering?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
yeah. we're really excited about where we are from a customer service perspective because, you know, when you build an adjacent product based on kind of this analogous problem set. like if you think about how tech teams detect and deal with incidents, it's very similar to how customer service teams learn about customer issues and have the time-sensitive challenge of having to like diagnose them, figure out how to deal with them, and then communicate them. and so, pagerduty is a natural fit for that problem, and salesforce has been a terrific partner in helping us bringing together what we can do from a mission-critical, time-sensitive work automation perspective within salesforce service cloud.
what's been really exciting to see are some of the larger wins that we've experienced. so, one, in particular, i mentioned in my prepared remarks was a fortune 50 company where we did a seven-figure deal that created -- was created and closed in the quarter through a reference from another executive. and i think it just points to how strategic customer service has become in a world where you have to win the customer over and over again and demonstrate trust and build their loyalty in a few seconds of a customer experience. if that doesn't work well, you know, it's very costly for the company.
this quarter, that particular customer expanded from more of a traditional pagerduty implementation to our -- adding our customer service offering. and that's seen and really reduced the existence of these code red issues that make their way all the way up to leadership where, you know, it's not a very efficient way to handle a problem if you have to get your executive team involved in it. and so, you're saving time, you're saving money, you're improving the overall executive experience. and i think what was exciting about that was, like i said, it was kind of a self-referencing deal.
and we see salesforce and that partnership as creating, you know, a tremendous opportunity because they are all over enterprise, and you know they are the platform of record for customer service and customer management. so, you know, we're pretty excited about that. and what's interesting about the product is you can do all the things that you can do inside of pagerduty without leaving service cloud environment. so, no context switching, you know, easy to use in a time-sensitive environment, and very quick time to value.
so, i think even at this particular customer, more expansion opportunity.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. great to hear. howard, maybe one for you. it looks like the new customer generation has stepped up nicely the last couple of quarters.
i know these are probably -- a lot of them are at the lower end, but can you remind us to how quickly you tend to maybe strike an expansion deal after you land a new customer? and then -- you know, so given that uptick in new customer generation, does that give you better visibility into growth in future quarters?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
it absolutely does. and i think this has been the beauty of the free tier for us because what that does is that it gives us visibility into that customer's life cycle earlier than we would have previously. because with our two-week trial that we had before, you know, at two weeks if they didn't convert, they were gone, like we didn't see them. whereas now, we actually have them using the product and we're getting far better at understanding the signals that indicate when a salesperson needs to be involved.
and so, often, we are able to watch that maturation process until they land. and it's not unusual for us to see a customer do multiple expansions in their first 12 months. so, they'll often start with maybe -- if it's a smallish company, they may start with a small team, maybe 10 users, maybe 20 users. but then they do, within the first 12 months as they bring more teams onto the platform, there's a good spurt of growth.
and then, obviously, depending on the size of the organization and depending on what's happening in the organization, it could then be driven by, you now, increased plan or plan upgrades, or increased product adoption. and what we also find is that we often -- we still typically start in dev, and often dev takes us into other parts of the business. and that is a pattern that we just repeat every quarter in terms of getting there. and the example that jen referenced of guidewire is a really good example of us being in the dev team, then into the it team, into business teams, into the executive.
it's a pattern that we see repeated.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. well done and congrats.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you. thanks, derrick.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thanks, derrick.
operator
next, you will hear from matt swanson with rbc. matt, go ahead.
matt swanson -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thank you. so, obviously on for matt hedberg. obviously, really great to hear about all the success in cs.
so, maybe following up on derrick's question and your answer jen about the analogous problem set. when we think about beyond cs security and itops, is there a fourth use case where you see kind of the same themes that show as a logical adjacency, maybe finance or hr, like you mentioned the talent shortage is pretty broad right now and it seems like a lot of people can use your help?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
you're exactly right. and, you know, there are infinite use cases across the enterprise and business operations. we've seen them in sales, marketing. our teams are pretty ingenious even in how they use pagerduty.
and i think the common thread is you're talking about this shift in the way work shows up for an individual person. it used to be structured. it used to walk in and look at your calendar in the office and just go from one meeting to the next. now, you know, a lot of work that comes at you is unpredictable, it's unstructured, it requires collaboration across teams across the business who are not, you know, within swivel chair reach to where you are, and requires intelligent routing and orchestration, and increasingly more and more automation because every company i work with is looking to improve productivity over time and retain the people that they have, and make sure they can up-level those people's work to the most important most innovative work.
and so, that's where i think automation has become really important. i think you're going to continue to hear more about the challenge of time-sensitive customer service issues. today, there was a public cloud outage, and companies are depending -- or depending increasingly on public cloud services on saas products, and software is imperfect. and those systems that you rely on are out of your control.
when one of them isn't having a good day, you need to be able to very quickly detect that issue, understand the dependencies of those services, and not just respond from a technology perspective, but be able to communicate with your customers and help them understand kind of where you are in that arc. and you don't want to be in the doghouse with your customers because one of the services that you subscribe to fail. and that's where pagerduty being scalable and resilient and secure, you know, and always available in an environment like that is super important. for instance, during the outage that happened this morning, we saw more than eight times the event transit on the platform and didn't flinch.
like we can undertake a lot of pressure in our system because of all of the redundancy that we built into that product. and that also allows us, i think, to be reliable for other different types of use cases whether it's employee onboarding and offboarding, managing, you know, web conversion from a growth marketing perspective, or managing urgent issues in finance or other parts of the business. so, the more we can do to make our platform flexible, to make it easy to use, to reduce the sort of developer jargon that's in the ux, and make it easier for just all types of employees the better, and automation is a big part of that.
matt swanson -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. and then maybe as a follow-up -- actually as a follow-up to that question, sometimes kind of a rarity. from your analyst day, you talked a little bit about automation as a new landing zone in the customers. and as this talent shortage feels less like something you can like push through for a couple of months and new -- kind of more like a new normal, which is another overused buzzword now, are you seeing automation being the new land into customers? and what is that doing maybe from like a sales philosophy standpoint?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
we are. and i think it's very early days for us because a number of the automation use cases that rundeck, you know, has designed -- is designed for and that it has managed very effectively, have nothing to do with incident response. that's obviously a place where our sales organization will naturally go. but because our automation solution starts with an open-source community, there's opportunity to discover lots of different new automation use cases, and then trade up into our enterprise offering.
so, i do believe that can continue to be a new land opportunity for us. and, you know, over time, part of the reason we've built a cloud-based automation services so we can also build a freemium funnel and a try-to-buy motion that is self-surface over time. that is not something we've done yet, but i think a great opportunity for us to build out that land motion in the future for automation.
matt swanson -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right. fantastic. yeah, it seems like you could build your product roadmap for you over time. congratulations on the quarter.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thank you.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt.
operator
[operator instructions] bhavan suri, we'll hear from next. if you want to switch your camera on. thanks.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company-- analyst
great. thanks. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to follow up on the previous questions, jen, a little bit.
you know, you bought rundeck, but you're talking a lot about automation. i'd love to -- 
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
bhavan, i think you're muted. we lost you.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company-- analyst
yeah. odd. i don't know why i'm muted. but anyway, where does the lines you want to draw about what you're automating versus a broader automation platform.
so itops, devops, there's broad automation platforms in their service. now, there's a ton of automation. you've got some of these workflow orchestration engines that do that, too. and so, where do you draw the line today, and maybe that line's blur and you start taking over some of those markets? how should we think about how your vision is 10 years down the road?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
yeah. our vision as the operations cloud is to take on more and more of the time-sensitive unstructured mission-critical work that has to happen across an organization. and that is not functionally used-case specific, like we absolutely intend to expand our surface area across the enterprise. and we specialize in that unexpected, kind of unpredictable, unstructured work because of our ability to be able to diagnose it, and intelligently route it, orchestrate it across teams, and increasingly automate the response, not just the detection or the orchestration.
but doesn't it a really important point, that we have always been in the automation business? we maybe didn't characterize it that way. but if you think about what we do using 625 integrations and sort of listen and see everything that's going on in the digital ecosystem to find signal in the noise and determine whether something is a major incident about to happen or an event storm about to become a major incident, or actually something you shouldn't worry about and should just hit the snooze button on, like that's a form of automation. intelligently routing that work to the right six people instead of getting 100 people on a call, that's automation. and increasingly -- like every time an incident or an event runs on the pagerduty platform, the platform is capturing that information in our proprietary data set, learning from it, and getting smarter, and helping you, institutionalize, getting smarter as a company on how you respond.
and increasingly like proactively prevent bad things from happening but maybe also address opportunities in a more time-effective way and more efficient way for your team. so, automation has always been a big part of pagerduty strategy and is going to continue to be a very big part of where we go. and i think, you know, one of the differences between us and maybe the ticketing systems, and the project management solutions that are out there is that we were designed for distributed teams. we are cloud-native from the beginning.
we interoperate with just about everything in the ecosystem. we're flexible and very easy to use. so, it means you can swarm to something and give the person closest to the problem, the accountability and the responsibility, and the visibility to act effectively in the moment. and the next time, you can automate that and have the machine do it for you.so, we're not in rpa.
we're not moving into some of those spaces, you know, that replace business process optimization. but i do think that more and more of the type of work that we solve for is how work happens in the workplace now as the result of covid and distributing work remote work, etc. and so, that's -- you know, when i think about the macro environment the way work has changed, has been a tailwind for us.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company-- analyst
yeah. let me flip that a little bit differently. you know, start to work with partners, and the basic alerting functionality, there's not a lot of services involved. but as you think about this automation, you think about deloitte, and i think you recently announced was tata, and you think about these guys, while the incident response piece is really important, the automation like this is happening.
it's usually with the next person, like collaboration. is that where they're seeing the focus, and the interest from those guys, or is it across the board, and how are the partnerships coming along?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
i mean, most of the partners that we work with are supporting customers in like big chunky digital transformation projects. sometimes they'll employ us as part of the cloud migration side of that solution. but sometimes it will be around the cultural change, and the change management associated with doing work a different way not relying on people in network operations center manually, watching blinking lights, and escalating things, etc. so, it varies from partner to partner, but we do see that as an opportunity in the future to engage more readily with some of those more traditional systems integrators or strategy firms that are out there.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company-- analyst
got it. that was really helpful. thanks and congrats.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
thank you.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer

ok, folks, looks like kingsley crane with berenberg gets to come with the final question for the group today unless we see any hands go up additionally. kingsley, please go ahead.
ed magi -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. this is ed magi on for kingsley crane. you expected to see a range of nrr between 118 to 124, and you came in at the high-end of the range here. do you believe the higher momentum here was a function or feature adoption or seat growth? i would love to better understand the next year, and if it's been different from the last few quarters and the momentum there.
thanks.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, ed. so, you know, for us it's always a mix of factors that are driving that growth. so, obviously, given just the improvement that we've seen in the adoption of the digital operations plan, that's been a contributor.
we've seen an increasing number of pagerduty customers adopt the pagerduty automation of the rundeck solution, so that's been a contributor. but the largest contributor is still users' seat expansion. so, we're not sold out in terms of users at any customer. so, every customer has the opportunity to deploy us into another team, and that certainly gets fed by if it's in dev, maybe adding to it or security or customer service.
and we're also starting to see customers using us in other business-type circumstances. so, those are the elements that actually build into that expansion within the customer base.
ed magi -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. and then another angle here, last quarter, you discussed momentum on customers spending more than 500k and $1 million with you guys. any color you want to share on these trends during the quarter help us further reconcile the enterprise, or is it going to be the same answer as we got for the nrr for the enterprise?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, what i will say is we're seeing good momentum above 500k and above a million. but we are focusing people's attention on our key metric, which is greater than 100k, which is -- you know, grew by 35% year over year.
ed magi -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
helpful. thanks for taking my questions. that's it from me, and congrats on the quarter.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks. thanks a lot, ed.

that looks like it for questions from the analyst team. jennifer, will turn over to you for final remarks, please.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer and chairperson
well, i'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and just reiterate how proud we are of the record quarter that we've delivered, and how confident and optimistic we are in the outlook going forward. you know, i personally have been involved in this business. i'm in my sixth year, and i have never been more excited about the opportunity. we're really living up to the promises that we've made about being the platform that becomes, you know, the platform for engagement within our customers' environments.
and this vision around the operations cloud is finally coming to fruition, which is personally very exciting, but wouldn't happen were if not for our customers placing their trust in us, and our dutonians, our employees, who work every day to reearn that trust. so, i just want to congratulate our team, say thank you to our customers, our investors, and wish all of you a very healthy happy holiday and a prosperous new year. thank you.

tony righetti
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss pagerduty's fourth quarter and fiscal full year 2022. with me on today's call are jennifer tejada, pagerduty's chairperson and chief executive officer; and howard wilson, our chief financial officer. before we begin, let me remind everyone that statements made on this call include forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements include our growth prospects and future revenue, among others, and represent our management's belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.
and we undertake no obligation to update these. during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in our earnings release. further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission.
with that, i will turn the call over to jennifer. 
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you, tony, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. before i speak to our results, i want to acknowledge that our thoughts and support are with the people of ukraine and those impacted by the ongoing conflict there. in a challenging macro environment, we continue to deliver consistent growth and strong results across the board, closing a terrific q4 on a tough comp and a fantastic full-year result that exceeded our top and bottom line guidance. we entered the new fiscal year with great momentum.
strong demand for our digital operations platform persist, driven by long-term tailwinds, cloud adoption, devops transformation, digital acceleration and the increasing appetite for automation in light of rising costs and a tight talent market. pagerduty's q4 results continue a trend of consistently strong company performance over the last several quarters, with the hallmarks of growth acceleration and improved operating leverage. q4 revenue grew 32% year over year to $79 million, our third consecutive quarter of growth above 30%. fy '22 total revenue was $281 million, also growing 32%, compared to 28% growth in the prior year.
for the fifth consecutive quarter, we achieved dollar-based net retention above 120%. our accomplishments this quarter and throughout fy '22 are a testament to our leadership and to our teams anticipating the needs of our customers. pagerduty's digital operations platform is central to our customers' growth strategies, helping them advance their digital maturity. we are efficiently capturing demand through product innovation, as well as a sustained focus and execution of our customer-facing teams whose daily efforts drive loyalty and expansion within our customer base.
exceptional results in q4 were driven by an increase throughout the year in multiproduct adoption incident response user expansion and customer loyalty with gross retention rates consistently above 95%. in short, we are building momentum in our business by closing larger and more comprehensive deals. more than half of our annual recurring revenue now comes from customers utilizing two or more pagerduty products. both event intelligence and automation are each growing at 70% or more year over year.
as pagerduty customers realize rapid time to value, they expand their use of our platform across the enterprise, beyond their devops teams, and they upgrade to advanced functionality like ai ops and automation that deliver compounding return on investment. through consistent product innovation and go-to-market execution, we've built a foundation for durable, efficient growth. average arr per customer increased during each quarter of fy '22 and exited the fourth quarter above $20,000. customers spending more than $100,000 annually with pagerduty grew 39% year over year, and those spending more than $1 million grew by 65%.
the continued shift toward digital first across industries creates more opportunity for increased penetration within all of our customer verticals. as businesses navigate a hybrid work environment, our customers prioritize investment to better manage mission-critical work. this work is urgent, unstructured and underserved by current it service management or traditional automation solutions. other platforms rely on humans to detect or identify issues and fail to account for the complex dependencies in modern digital infrastructure.
modern work is no longer ticket-based. it's driven by events and incidents. pagerduty is purpose-built to efficiently facilitate and automate the type of work that's essential to modern business success, who needs to perform it and how it will be managed. we are investing in more flexible workflow automation that serves new use cases and augments our current offerings for dev and it teams.
with our acquisition of catalytic, we complement our leadership in devops workflow automation with a no-code offering that brings the same value to teams and business functions like sales, marketing and finance. we're thrilled to welcome sean, ravi and the entire catalytic team to pagerduty. an idc survey released at the end of 2021 reinforces the need for this approach. more than half of all developers surveyed reported their organizations have more than 100 services in production at any given time.
service proliferation is rapidly outpacing the capacity of technical workers as talent becomes more expensive and difficult to acquire and hard to retain. these trends underscore the need for machine learning and automation that offer productivity, efficiency and innovation. our focused innovation has cemented pagerduty as the market standard for both devops automation and digital operations. we've expanded our reach to customer service operations, it, and more broadly, process automation.
increasingly, our customers deploy two or more pagerduty products relying on our platform to mature their digital operations. pagerduty's combination of incident response, aiops, customer service ops and automation provides the time and efficiency for our users to prioritize both innovation and availability. in a world of unstructured data from a wide range of sources, we now enable more than 650 integrations, converting data to high-fidelity actionable signals, orchestrating and automating time-sensitive work across the business. in q4, we shipped general availability for both event orchestration and round-robin scheduling.
event orchestration intelligently suppresses noise, so teams can focus on the most critical signals and enables automated incident diagnoses in remediation. this lowers the cost of the response and the risk of the incident itself. round-robin scheduling allows centralized and decentralized teams to implement flexible, automated on-call responsibilities. we believe no other platform is more flexible and resilient at scale than pagerduty or provides quicker time to value with compounding return on investment over time.
we deployed new capabilities throughout the fiscal year, extending our incident response, aiops and process automation solutions, which are now leveraged by teams in devops, itops, security operations and business operations. our fourth paid offering, customer service operations, continues to gain market traction, with several high-value deals closed in the second half of fy '22. this further diversifies our product revenue by addressing a substantial market opportunity with customer support teams. the integration of catalytic into our platform accelerates our product road map and opens new addressable opportunities within our customer base.
our platform serves more needs across enterprises -- or sorry, as our platform serves more needs across enterprises, we expect multiproduct adoption to continue its upward trajectory in fy '23. with customer ops and flexible no-code workflows, nontechnical employees, citizen developers and leaders across the entire business can leverage pagerduty to anticipate and manage their most critical work. this will enable more accessible, agile and scalable workflows to operations outside of devops, it and security. we increasingly see this with our customers.
in q4, we significantly expanded our work with a cloud-native digital marketplace customer, operating in more than 460 cities across asia, with ambitions to enter additional markets in the coming years. the organization has been a pagerduty customer since 2014. and including its activity in the last quarter, has expanded its business with us more than 70 times, purchasing additional licenses, upgrading to digital operations and, more recently, adding our enterprise automation product. they currently utilize over 800 integrations between pagerduty and other services within the company's ecosystem.
as a result, the company has realized an annual benefit of $3.4 million with pagerduty. looking forward to fy '23, we are focused on advancing our mission to revolutionize operations and build customer trust by anticipating the unexpected in an unpredictable world. time has never been more fleeting or valuable, and talent comes at an increasingly high price. it's more important than ever for customers to identify mission-critical, time-sensitive opportunities and manage the complex data and systems that underpin their products and end-customer experiences.
the operations cloud is built on the foundation of pagerduty's digital operations platform, extended by our integration ecosystem, leveraging our proprietary data set and enabling both orchestration and automation. we believe the operations cloud will rapidly become the standard for modern enterprises. it's cloud native, designed to simplify the complex, built for distributed organizations, easy to deploy and trusted by developers and technical leaders behind your favorite brands. we continue to scale efficiently and improve our operating leverage and expect to be non-gaap profitable for the full year fy '24.
we expect to realize this goal through continued investment in product-led growth, our land-and-expand flywheel and activating new routes to market. pagerduty remains the only cloud-native platform that combines real-time incentive response with time-critical aiops insights and automation to help teams across leading enterprises revolutionize their operations. our exceptional results and momentum over the last several quarters demonstrate durable multi-engine growth. our vision for an equitable world guides our strategy, our investments and our focus on our customers and our users.
we will continue to develop our inclusive culture and to lead with our values, delivering great products for our users and high performance for our stakeholders, while working to improve the communities around us through our social impact programs. in fy '22, 92% of dutonians volunteered their time or made charitable contributions, including to several causes matched by the company. through pagerduty.org, we acquired new nonprofit customers focused on disaster response, addressing homelessness and child literacy. i encourage you to learn more about our efforts in our upcoming annual impact report.
this week also recognizes equal payday in the united states. i'm incredibly proud of our commitment to and our success in achieving pay equity within $0.01 between male and female employees and within $0.02 across race and ethnicity, and hope others will follow our lead. we enter fy '23 with incredible momentum, a testament to, not only our leadership team, but to the incredible work of dutonians around the globe. throughout fy '22, our teams ran together to innovate relentlessly in service of our customers, demonstrating the value of new products as they gain traction in the market and built the foundation for further growth.
i deeply appreciate the leaders who bet on us, our more than 1 million users and our customer champions. in an unpredictable and fast-changing environment, they place their trust in pagerduty to drive their digital transformation and maintain the integrity of their operations. given long-term tailwinds and consistently strong execution, i am very confident in our ability to continue growing efficiently and sustainability -- and sustainably as the operations cloud becomes the standard for modern enterprises. with that, i'll turn to howard, and i look forward to your questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen, and good day to everyone joining us on this afternoon's call. we are proud of our outstanding fourth quarter and full fiscal year results. the growth demonstrates our success in growing our mid-market and enterprise segments, the expanding number of use cases for the pagerduty platform and traction for our new products, including event intelligence, automation and customer service operations. revenue was $79 million for the fourth quarter, up 32% year over year, an acceleration of 300 basis points over q4 of fiscal year 2021.
international revenue grew at 32% and represents 24% of total revenues. our dollar-based net retention rate in q4 was 124%, compared to 121% in the same period one year ago. we have delivered dbnr above 120% for five consecutive quarters and expect to be at or above 120% over the next year. we continue to gain momentum in mid-market and enterprise through ongoing strong innovation and go-to-market execution.
q4 ended with 594 customers with arr over $100,000, up 39% from a year ago. additionally, our customers with arr over $1 million increased to 43, up 65% compared to q4 of last year. this is a number we provide on an annual basis. we ended q4 with 14,865 paid customers, up 7% compared to a year ago.
this is a moderate acceleration sequentially, and it is worth noting that q4 anniversary is the introduction of our free tier, which was first offered late in q3 of fy '21. free and paid companies on our platform grew to over 20,000, an increase of 27% year over year, with free continuing to provide a funnel for future paid growth. our highest-tier plan, digital operations, increased to 23% of our total arr, up from 21% a year ago. this metric is a conservative proxy for platform adoption, but it does not entirely capture customers using more than one paid product.
our professional and business plans can be augmented with event intelligence, and process automation and customer service are available on a stand-alone basis. and to that end, and to provide some additional insight, approximately 51% of our arr comes from customers using two or more paid products. this is up from 47% in fy '21 and from 32% in fy '20. we will update this metric on an annual basis.
our q4 non-gaap gross margin was 84% and within our target range. this percentage is down marginally on a sequential basis due to a slight uptick in hosting and messaging fees during the quarter. non-gaap operating loss improved to $2 million or 3% of revenue, compared to a loss of $5 million or 8% of revenue in the same quarter last year, primarily a result of sustainable sales and marketing efficiency gains and economies of scale across g&a. in terms of cash flow for the quarter, cash from operations was $1 million, and free cash flow was negative $1 million.
now for the full fiscal year. revenue was $281 million, up 32% year over year as we accelerated growth from 28% last year. non-gaap gross margin was 85%, down approximately 200 basis points from 87%. non-gaap operating loss was $23 million or 8% of revenue, compared to a loss of $18 million or 8% of revenue a year ago.
this year includes approximately $4 million of expenses related to a limited return to office and increase in travel compared to the prior year, which was the first year of the pandemic. operating cash flow was negative $6 million, compared to $10 million a year ago. free cash flow was negative $30 million, compared to positive $5 million in fiscal 2021, and headcount increased to 950, up 21% year over year. turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $543 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.
total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $170 million, up 31% year over year. quarterly billings were $106 million, which was an increase of 30% year over year, exceeding the high end of the range we provided during last quarter's call. this included approximately $2 million of early renewals. we expect billings growth for q1 to be in the range of 25% to 30%.
on a trailing 12-month basis, billings were $322 million, an increase of 28% compared to a year ago and above the top of the range provided during our last call. as a reminder, the comparable period q4 of fy '21 included a one-time benefit of approximately $6 million from early renewals. we expect trailing 12-months' billings growth exiting the first quarter to be at or above 30% over last year. before moving on to guidance, i would like to introduce the second annual metric, annual recurring revenue or arr.
given the increasing scale of pagerduty and inherent fluctuation in quarterly billings, we wanted to provide additional color on the fiscal year. we exited q4 with $326 million in annual recurring revenue, which was an increase of 32% year over year. turning now to our guidance, which includes top and bottom line considerations for the acquisition of catalytic, which closed on march 8, as well as our expectations for increases to certain line items that was suppressed during the past year owing to the pandemic. for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $81.5 million to $83.5 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 31%.
non-gaap net loss per share in the range of $0.09 to $0.08, with basic shares outstanding of approximately 87 million. this implies a non-gaap operating margin in the range of negative 8% to negative 7%. for the full fiscal year 2023, we are initiating revenue guidance for the full year of $360 million to $366 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 30%. we expect non-gaap net loss per share of $0.23 to $0.17, with basic shares outstanding of approximately 88 million.
this implies a non-gaap operating margin of negative 6% to negative 4%. before moving to q&a, i would like to provide some details to assist with modeling fy '23. non-gaap operating margin is expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter as merit increases, payroll taxes, summit, our annual user event are first half occurrences. to put a finer point on the trend, we expect each quarter of fy '23 to be an improvement over the corresponding fy '22 quarter.
we expect cash from operations and free cash flow to follow a pattern similar to last year, with q2 being the low and q4 the half. seasonal factors influencing cash during the first half are bonus payouts in q1, interest payments on convertible debt, annual merit increases and espp. and we expect non-gaap gross margin to be in our target range between 84% and 86%. i want to thank our customers for their trust in us and our team for delivering an outstanding fiscal year of product innovation and four quarters of terrific go-to-market execution.
our innovation investments are designed to actualize our vision to transform critical work and revolutionize operations as the operations cloud to the modern enterprise, while continuing to scale toward non-gaap profitability. i continue to remain confident in our business and performance, given the market demand, the acceleration of our product innovation, strong tailwinds and our consistent execution. and with that, i will open up the call for q&a.
tony righetti
ok. we ask that our analysts that have questions for the team do raise their hand. we have a number of hands raised already. we're going to turn first to sanjit singh at morgan stanley.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. congrats to the team on an exceptional year, accelerating growth. it was really great to see. and the guidance was good, too.
so jen, maybe from your end, what is coming together across the product portfolio? i was wondering if you could address a couple of things on the execution side of the house, the free-to-paid conversion and sort of the adoption of some of the add-on products, whether it's rundeck. you mentioned customer service. what are you seeing in terms of the trend lines there on the uptake on the add-on products?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
sure. well, it's great to hear from you, and thanks for being here today. we are incredibly proud of the result this year, and i'm incredibly proud of our team and super appreciative of our customers. but it's the story we've been telling.
long-term tailwinds, digital acceleration is not going away. cloud adoption continues. devops transformation, most of our customers are still early in that journey. and now, we're seeing macro impacts like inflation, where people are trying to figure out how they're going to get more out of their current operating expenses.
and that creates, i think, a broader appetite for automation, and we're definitely seeing that. in particular, the ongoing digitization of every business has meant that customer service ops is becoming increasingly more interesting for our customers because they can't solve problems in a brick-and-mortar environment. they can't wait hours for a ticket to get through queues. they actually have to resolve things in a very time-sensitive way.
and their teams are distributed by design due to hybrid work and the flexibility that many employers have offered their employees. and i think that will continue to be the case because even if some people bring their folks back into the office, everybody won't be in the office in the same day and people have moved out of urban locations. we also built this really healthy foundation by extending our lead in incident response. and that kind of creates the platform for product attach.
these things kind of go together like hand in glove. and the consistent innovation that we've seen in a very focused way, i think, has really led our customers to count on us for anything that's specific to what i call real-time digital operations. so just a lot of the macro moving in our favor. finally, i would just say, really strong execution on the part of our teams, whether it's our customer support and customer service teams who maintain best-in-class gross retention and huge customer loyalty or our sales team, so have done a really good job of really focusing on solution selling and selling value and improving execution across the board or the product teams that's really speeding up all of our innovation.
and i like what i'm seeing from a free-to-paid conversion perspective. as you know, free really creates an opportunity for customers to try our product, get used to it, to understand the value that it can create before they have to invest. i think we're getting better and better at managing that conversion process and have a lot of focus around it right now.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sorry, i was saying maybe i can just jump in and add. the thesis behind free was really around capturing the broader market. but our focus is really around how do we ensure that we capture the mid-market and enterprise customers because that accounts for more than 80% of our arr. and so if you just look at the numbers, the number of customers that are above $100,000, that grew 39%; above $1 million, grew by 65%.
and we're seeing double-digit customer growth in enterprise and mid-market. so that's working as designed and planned. and the results are showing up in those numbers, including our dollar-based net retention.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. and i appreciate all the color. the follow-up question, and maybe it's sort of two parts, one for jen, one for howard, is just around the catalytic acquisition. jen, i was wondering if you can walk us through the rationale of why it makes sense for pagerduty to move into more of these business workflows associated with finance teams, sales teams and marketing teams? and then for howard, if you could make -- is there any comment you have that you can help us understand the contribution of catalytic to the full year guide, whether in terms of arr or in terms of revenue, the contribution that's assumed in the guidance.
and from there, i'll see the floor. thank you very much.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you. and i'll point to our customers. i mean, they're already pulling us in that direction. we have customers today that use us in legal and finance and sales, marketing, in human resources, etc.
so we could see the demand. but we also know that those customers have requirements for more intuitive, more flexible workflows. the devops workflow that our platform was built around is very determinant. and so creating more flexible workflows and offerings that serve, like i said, the citizen developer or the less technical user, has become important to our customers, and they're telling us that.
so catalytic is all about a strategic product acquisition. it accelerates our road map. it provides a no-code offering that can serve some of these new use cases. it also enabled us to acquire a great team in chicago to expand our development capabilities.
i'm a midwesterner, so i feel really good about that. i'll let howard talk a little bit about how this works from a financial perspective.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure. and yes, a significant acquisition for us from a strategy perspective, but immaterial from a financial perspective. this was a young, early start-up, not profitable. but certainly, we see from a top line contribution less than $5 million in revenue.
so probably around 1% of our total revenue number for the year. and from a bottom line perspective, the guidance that we've given incorporates the incremental expense that we see bringing in -- with catalytic.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
appreciate it. thank you, howard.
tony righetti
ok. next, we'll hear from sterling auty at j.p. morgan. sterling, come on and join us.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
well, thanks for letting me join you. and just actually going to ask one question from my side, and it's really about the competitive landscape. i think the earnings release, timely in light of servicenow's announcement of incident response under lightstep. can you give us a sense of, when you look at that solution, how does that compare and contrast? as well as -- it feels like some of the other traditional competition out of atlassian and splunk has kind of faded.
and just wondering if there's any update around win rates more generally?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. the competitive landscape for us continues to be favorable, and it improves as we innovate. and i think the focus in our innovation around not just incident response, more broadly, incident management, aiops, now customer service ops, just lays a much broader foundation for us to grow upon. and if you think about the integration ecosystem that we built, it also sees pagerduty being a really essential infrastructure for our customers from a technical perspective.
so we don't see customers taking risks to make changes. and i think other players that are out there have much earlier, less-proven, less-resilient products, and so we continue to see very good success from a competitive position. the bottom line is there isn't anybody out there that sort of can offer the breadth, the depth at the scale and the resiliency of the pagerduty platform. and we are seeing this real convergence of incident response, aiops and automation coming together, where our offering is unparalleled.
and i think there's a lot to be said for customer loyalty as well. we work every day to earn the trust of our customers, and they demonstrate that in their continued work with us.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
makes sense. thank you, guys.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you.
tony righetti
ok. thank you. moving on, on our list, we are going to hear from joel fishbein from truist.
joel fishbein -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, thank you, and congratulations on the great results as well. and this is sort of a follow-up to sterling's question, which is rundeck version 4.0 is coming out with a release. i'd love jennifer, if you could just tell us what's new in that that may enhance your competitive positioning. i think that would be interesting.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
well, rundeck -- so we call this process automation now as well, if that -- i hope that doesn't confuse people. but really proud of what the teams have accomplished in really integrating rundeck more closely into our framework with rundeck actions or runbook actions, and also delivering it as a cloud solution. so it means it's really easier for customers to trial, easy for customers to buy and easier to apply what was historically known as rundeck to use cases that go beyond devops and itops and can be used across it and across other parts of the organization. so easier use in the cloud, driving direct actions integrated into pagerduty.
so what you're seeing is more seamless automation of the incident response in the pagerduty incident response workflow and easier to try and acquire. so one of the things i'm excited about is rundeck as a land motion for us as a company.
joel fishbein -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
and joel, you should come to our summit event in june, since i have publicity, because you'll hear more about some of these exciting product innovations.
joel fishbein -- truist securities -- analyst
i will be there.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
howard is on top of it today.
tony righetti
thank you, joel. moving on to bhavan suri. let me bring you on.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you, and i'll add my congrats. two quick questions, one of them, tactical. i know jennifer, you touched on inflation, but obviously, there's probably a recession in europe. and we certainly heard from companies saying our large customers are in cash conservation mode, everything else.
some sense of what you're seeing, deal-flow wise, new bookings-wise. because revenues, it is what it is. you guys have fairly quick close rates here in the smb or mid-market. but some sense of what you're seeing in europe, given what's happening and the protracted potential outcome there?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. let's talk a little bit about that. i mean, the tailwinds remain the same. and i think in a recessionary environment, people will continue to look for ways to automate more and more of their operations to leverage the cloud to reduce their production costs, etc.
so i think we'll continue to see some of those strategic efforts that are underway. i think inflation is potentially a tailwind for automation as well because you've got the combination of rising talent costs and then the challenge of rising supply costs overall. and i'll speak to europe just for a second. when we think about what's going on in ukraine and russia, that represents a very immaterial amount of our business.
more broadly, europe represents roughly 12%, 13% of total revenue. and we haven't seen a change in the buying signal. so we continue to see our customers there looking for support in maturing their digital operations and moving away from more manual process to things where they can drive efficiencies across their business.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company -- analyst
no, that's helpful. thank you. and then a broader question. i think a couple of people have touched on it a little bit.
but as you look at this operations cloud, and historically, businesses are separate. you have transactional operations businesses and you have analytics businesses. but as i look at the data, and i look at the insights, there is this concept of moving up like sort of that maslow's hierarchy of data, right? so collection is a big part. but you already address collection.
how do you think about getting to that prescriptive, kind of the top part of that pyramid, which is i'll prescribe it, i'll predict it? and is that part of the road map in three years, five years? how should we think about your --
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
we already do that today, bhavan. i mean, that was a big part of what event intelligence brought to our product set when we first started out with that product and now, more broadly, have invested in an aiop solution. so in the pagerduty platform, we leverage machine learning across a deep, more than a decade of data -- proprietary data set to not only predict that things are going to occur, but make recommendations on how to improve the scenario or prevent an incident from happening again. so -- and that's already a big part of our offering, and it's one of the reasons why we see our aiops solution and our automation solution both growing over 70% in the last year.
and i think we're very, very early, kind of to use a cliche, tip of the iceberg there. i think there is much more opportunity for that as teams get more comfortable, as customers get more comfortable relying on platforms like event intelligence and automation that provide safe self-healing, where you can see the automation that's going to run. it's easy to roll back. it's integrated into your overall workflow.
and i think they're starting to recognize the benefit of the platform learning and providing more value every time an incident runs across it, which is very different than any of the other offerings that have been mentioned earlier in the call.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company -- analyst
yes, no, it's helpful. we'll call it the tip of maslow's pyramid.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
there you go. i'm always trying to climb to the peak. like that's the best part of the game.
bhavan suri -- william blair and company -- analyst
no, no, i appreciate that. thank you.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
pleasure.
tony righetti
excellent. thanks. we're going to hear next from chad bennett at craig-hallum. chad, if you could join us.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. so can we get an update, looking at the fourth quarter and maybe the last year, now that we've completed the year, in terms of where a secops and where customer service ops penetration kind of went from and to? and kind of how that kind of sales execution, sales process, progress during the year and kind of where we ended? and what we think potentially that business or that use case could do in the upcoming year from a growth standpoint?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
i'll start that. and howard, if you want to jump in, let me know. from a customer service ops perspective, that's still a very early product. but what we are seeing is more of a top-down sale there.
so some significant deals in the back half of the year, which has been great. and a few of those deals have been referred by leaders from one company to another. so the problem is definitely like a senior leadership problem. it's not just a user issue.
and that's somewhat unique to the platform for us. from a security perspective, what's really interesting about security is kind of a shift in the last really six months, just given the heightened sort of vulnerability and threat environment. what we're seeing is a focus on security resiliency. so it's not just about trying to prevent a hack or a breach from happening.
we know it's going to happen. it's how well and how quickly can you respond and put yourself in a position that you can keep your customers and your data safe. and that has seen a lot of adoption of pagerduty in devsecops teams and security ops, but we don't separate those users from our regular incident response users. there isn't a separate sku there today.
we don't have a separate sku for a security operations center. not to say we wouldn't do something there in the future. but i think that continues to be part of our growth story, but it's more integrated into our traditional incident response numbers.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. and what i would add, chad, as jen said, we've been seeing good traction in both those areas. we have periodically shared those numbers in terms of how we've seen that growth. they have both continued to grow each quarter, but we haven't planned to give an update on the specific numbers for this call.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then maybe a quick follow-up on net expansion and net retention. so howard, i think up until now -- and it's great to see the two-plus product disclosure in that 51% arr. but i think up until now, the majority of net expansion has been driven by users, if i'm correct, kind of historically.
but we have a pretty good kind of 51% two-plus product number. i guess my question would be, how should we think about net expansion going forward, kind of the user base net expansion versus cross-sell, upsell platform kind of growth or net expansion in -- i know i've harped on you before on it, but what would make net expansion go backwards?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
so let me get to your first part of the question. what i would say is that our growth is still driven principally by adding new users, right? but what's interesting is how we've seen the shift over the last two years is it's not just users of one product. it's users either of our digital operations plan, which represents two products or it's adding additional products like event intelligence, and more recently, automation, customer service ops. so if you had to think about it, it's still users primarily and then adding on the additional product.
so that, i guess, is not unusual in terms of how that flow would work. in terms of looking forward on dollar-based net expansion, like we are really pleased with the progress that we've seen in terms of getting above 120% for five orders now. and our view is that that's sustainable. and we see ourselves being above that number into this next year.
in terms of what could make that go backwards would be high levels of customer churn, right, or customers downgrading. so just in terms of pure mechanics. and what i would say is if you look at our gross retention number, it's consistently been above 95%. the guidance i'm giving to folks is 120% or above for the next year.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
just howard being howard. i appreciate it. thank you. nice job on the quarter again.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, chad.
tony righetti
wonderful. next, we'll hear from derrick wood at cowen. derrick, if you'd like to join us.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
yup. great to see everyone. congrats on a great finish to the year. i wanted to start on the kind of the go-to-market and product strategy with catalytics.
will that be a separate sku? or do you plan to absorb that into a core product line? and if the latter, any sense as to how long that will take? and i guess from a go-to-market, will you ever think about having dedicated sales teams to go after line of business? or will this be part of the bag for core aes?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
well, we're looking at that all right now. i mean with rundeck, we initially kept rundeck separate just to allow it to gain some momentum and make sure that we didn't disrupt their product road map as they were coming into the company. with catalytic, we learned a lot from rundeck. so there are some functionality with catalytic today that we would like to deploy to all of our customers.
the flexibility and the flexible workflows, or what they call smart workflows, can be leveraged in a lot of different ways by devops and it teams, whether it's centralized or decentralized. so catalytic accelerates some of the work that we were already doing to improve the flexibility in our workflows and just make it easier for customers to connect to everyone, connect to everything and get work detected and done faster in a more traditional incident response or devops perspective and increasingly in it operations perspective. so -- and at the same time, like we anticipate working with catalytic customers, understand like where they're getting the most value from their business use cases, and then hope to replicate that and bring them on to the pagerduty platform. and they have some really interesting customers like mayo clinic and bosch, etc.
so we think we're going to learn a lot there, but it's still very early days.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
helpful color. thanks. and then, jen, you mentioned activating new routes to market is a key focus going forward. i guess so as it pertains to the channel, where are you most focused on in terms of investing in partnerships? and anything new we should be thinking about going into the new year?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. we're looking at accelerating some of the efforts that we have with strategic partners. as i've mentioned in the past, aws has been a great channel to market, and we're doubling down with them to continue to expand our reach to both customers that we serve today, but also from a customer acquisition perspective, particularly within mid-market and enterprise. and even aws marketplace has been a good platform for us as we look at the start-ups that see us as part of the five or six things they need in their start-up tool kit.
so strategic relationships like that will continue to be important. working with partners to get to regions that we're not currently in today, i mean, we really have a lot of opportunity in the broader global footprint to go after, and we don't need to do all of that ourselves. so looking at new regional markets where we don't have to put feet in the street, we can work with partners, will be really important as well. and dave, our sales leadership, i think, is doing a really good job of thinking about how we prioritize those.
and you can expect to hear more about that in the future.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. congrats.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thank you so much. i hope i'll see you at summit in june, been a long time.
derrick wood -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. you bet. yeah.
tony righetti
ok. a couple more folks. we'll hear next from shrenik kothari. i hope i said that right for you.
go ahead.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, that's right. this is shrenik on for rob. really, really great quarter, strong momentum, driven by the multiproduct. so as a follow-up to some of the earlier questions, i think by bhavan and chad.
sorry, if i might have missed that, but did you break out the nrr for large customers this time around? like how is it trending versus -- it was about 130% or so last quarter. and then a follow-up.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
so shrenik, i think you're referring to -- we've previously sort of broken down our dollar-based net retention. is that what your question is? we haven't provided that breakdown this quarter. we see healthy dollar-based net retention across all our segments, 124% for the quarter.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. i think i would point you to, if you look at our customer cohorts that are spending $100,000 in arr or $1 million, now are growing 39% and 65%, respectively, we're feeling really good about those numbers. and i give a shout out to the go-to-market teams because they have done a really good job of striking the balance between getting large deals done, large strategic deals, multiproduct deals, multiyear deals done and at the same time, continuing to drive the flywheel of transactional small deals, which make our revenue run rate more predictable.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird -- analyst
got it. thanks, jen. thanks, howard. so one quick follow-up.
i know you mentioned or touched upon it a little bit, the paying customer base growth picked up to like about 8% year on year and sequentially also really good. and in terms of the conversion, i just wanted to understand, like how much follow-through are you seeing from the top of the funnel in terms of conversion rate trends? i know you touched upon it a bit, but just wanted to understand like the trends versus last quarters.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure. so we haven't provided specific numbers on this, shrenik, as you know, but the model as designed is doing what we expect. so part of the thesis behind this was to create a funnel that would help feed the overall number of companies on our platform and allow us to get early visibility into mid-market and enterprise customers that we could then look to convert. and when we look at the growth in our enterprise and mid-market customers, that's double-digit growth.
so significantly higher than the overall growth in our paying customer base. and that's exactly the result that we're looking for.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
yeah. and i would just add to that that i'm still pretty excited about the fact that when we look at free and paid growth together, that's at 27%. and we're also still seeing average revenue per customer go up above $200,000. so --
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
$20,000.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
sorry, $20,000. i added a zero. thank you, howard.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
$200,000 would be good. but $20,000 for now.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
$200,000 would be awesome, but that's not -- we're not there yet. yet.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird -- analyst
got it. got it. thanks a lot, jen and howard. appreciate it.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thanks, shrenik.
tony righetti
ok. thank you. and we'll round things out today with matt hedberg. matt, coming over to you.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks. hey, howard, i really like the arr disclosure, something i think we've been asking for a while. so i certainly do appreciate that. is that something that you're going to update us on a quarterly basis? and i guess, theoretically, should that help smooth out co-terming and be sort of a better growth metric than billings?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
so our plan is to provide it on an annual basis, matt, just because we feel that there's -- some of the movements by quarter effectively could be -- could end up disclosing proprietary movement from a company perspective. so we're thinking about this on an annual basis. but obviously, i think when people look at that, triangulate that with the billings information that we'll be sharing, they're going to have a much better view. and we'll continue to provide guidance around our quarterly billings and trailing 12-month billings to give you that more complete picture.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
maybe then i guess, how should we interpret arr then in terms of like is it -- does it -- it sounds like you're not going to give it quarterly because there may be some volatility in there as opposed to kind of being more of a smooth belt metric?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. that is correct. i mean it's not so much volatility, but it does give you an indication of the starting point where we are at the start of this year. and it will help you then see the progression that we're making each quarter relative to billings as we provide the billings through the course of the year.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot, guys.
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. i'd also point out that we have, i think, for the first time, shared our outlook on our time to profitability. i mean, we are confident and committed to profitability by fy '24. so in addition to sharing an annual arr number, we're very excited about, not only the growth acceleration we've seen last year, the momentum that we have going into this year, particularly in mid-market and enterprise.
and the fact that we are seeing leverage at scale and expect to continue to improve our operating leverage while we sustain these growth rates. so pretty exciting times for the company.
tony righetti
currently, we have no further analyst questions. jennifer, if you'd like to take us home?
jennifer tejada -- chairperson and chief executive officer
great. well, first of all, i just want to say thank you, everyone, for being here today. in closing, fy '22 was an outstanding year for the company. our accelerated growth and sustained performance provides an excellent foundation for durable growth in the years ahead.
we are committed to non-gaap profitability in fy '24, and we remain focused on earning the trust of our customers every day. thank you, and be well.

thank you, christine. our strong fy '23 q1 results extended our momentum from last fiscal year. revenue grew 34%, an acceleration from q1 in fy '22 and our fourth consecutive quarter of growth over 30%. our operating leverage is increasing as we scale, with operating margin improving over 600 basis points year on year as we progress toward our goal of profitability for the full year fy '24.
our long-term tailwinds, digital acceleration, cloud adoption and devops transformation are top priorities for organizations worldwide. we continue to capture demand from a large tam as companies strive for efficiency and productivity. as a result, we're raising our full year top and bottom-line guidance ranges. i want to thank our teams around the world who remain laser-focused on measurable customer success or measurable customer outcomes and continue to execute well.
as always, i want to recognize our customers and partners. they placed their trust in pagerduty, and our success is driven by their success. our customers are incredibly loyal. our gross retention remains above 95%, as it has for over five years.
customer expansion was also strong during the quarter, with dollar-based net retention increasing to 126%, above 120% for the sixth consecutive quarter. the mid-market and enterprise segments continue to drive growth, with customers spending more than $100,000 annually in arr, up 43% year over year. these consistently strong results are driven by a robust demand environment, market-leading multiproduct platform innovation and in-period field execution from our go-to-market teams. our customers' digital transformation and cloud adoption initiatives are strategic multiyear projects.
in order to innovate to deliver superior customer experiences and optimize talent, they require a platform for action that orchestrates and automates their digital operations. pagerduty is essential infrastructure in their drive toward digital maturity and a strategic partner accelerating long-term digital transformation. our market conditions remain favorable. digital infrastructures are increasingly more complex and interdependent, driving demand for our platform throughout our customer base and across our target markets.
digital transformation is often underpinned by distributed architectures, data density and continuous deployment, resulting in service proliferation outpacing human capacity. developers, sres, it and security teams and leadership are overwhelmed. interrupt work, which is unplanned, unstructured, time-sensitive, yet often mission-critical, has quickly emerged as the standard mode of operations for knowledge workers. surging incidents, customer expectations and demand for innovation, all compete for developer attention, where manual firefighting is the enemy of innovation.
unmanaged, this interrupt work and its impact on in-house experts can hamper growth and stifle strategic high-value initiatives. built on the foundation of our digital operations platform, pagerduty's operations cloud enables both orchestration and automation for all types of interrupt work by leveraging our proprietary data set and extending our integration ecosystem. the operations cloud is quickly becoming the standard for modern work. it's cloud native, designed to simplify the complex, built for distributed organizations, easy to deploy and trusted by developers and technical leaders behind your favorite brands.
pagerduty is the most trusted and resilient digital operations platform at scale with nearly 670 integrations serving both traditional devops use cases and new ones like robotics and data operations. our ai-based insights and workflow automation rapidly identify time-sensitive opportunities and incidents, while freeing up capacity and improving efficiency. in this tight telling environment, this has become increasingly important. during q1, a leading online recruiting platform significantly expanded their deployment with us.
as typical with our customers, they initially implemented pagerduty for their site reliability engineering teams in 2014. they upgraded to our digital operations plan this quarter on the back of several user expansions. with the addition of event intelligence, they've already achieved 22% reduction in events. we project an expected roi of nearly $2 million in the first year.
this rapid speed to value is a hallmark of pagerduty products. in our march product release, we highlighted new process automation solutions now generally available. process automation on-prem 4.0 enhances security, stability and usability, while making it simple for our customers to handle incident response and service request use cases across geographically distributed infrastructure, including those who require 0 trust communication. we also released pagerduty runbook automation, a new cloud native saas offering that provides customers with a fast start to process automation that is both highly secure and available without having to manage automation infrastructure.
these releases build on our incident response and aiops offerings and enable enterprises to accelerate their digital operations from manual and reactive toward proactive and preventative. pagerduty is the only cloud native digital operations platform to combine automation across observability, engagement and action, with the ability to service diverse teams across the enterprise. the integration of automation is an essential step in bringing customers along their digital operations maturity journey. our process automation customers start by using pagerduty to capture and automate common repetitive tasks and to diagnose and remediate recurring incidents.
for example, automating diagnostics to fix an online shopping cart failure. quantifiable cost savings and efficiency gains then spur expansion of pagerduty beyond devops, it and sre teams to realize gains in other areas of the business, most commonly in security and customer service. sailpoint, an identity security platform, has been a pagerduty customer for nearly a decade. this quarter, they deployed pagerduty event intelligence in addition to expanded use of incident response for their customer support teams.
this enabled them to consolidate what were 50 individual incidents into a single incident and achieve an 85% reduction in overall incidents, while improving their time to acknowledge and resolve them. pagerduty is helping sailpoint achieve their true service ownership and to communicate to customers more proactively during incidents. regardless of company size or existing commitments, our customers tend to repeatedly expand our relationship as they move up the digital operations maturity curve. even our largest customers expand their investment in pagerduty through new product adoption, user expansion and new use cases.
every customer presents a new expansion opportunity as digital acceleration initiatives span the entire enterprise. demonstrating this land-and-expand motion, a leading financial service institution launched pagerduty in 2019 with an initial purchase for group delivering applications for high-value clients, then expanded rapidly across other teams through several additional purchases to over $1 million in arr. as it became evident that teams on pagerduty resolving issues up to 75% faster, they made an additional seven figure investment this quarter. they added thousands of new users, standardizing on pagerduty for incident response, and deployed aiops and automation across multiple teams.
relationships like this drive our high dollar-based net retention rates, a measure of our durable and growing relationships with our customers. pagerduty's operations cloud now offers four land products and multiple cross-sell and upsell expansion opportunities, while delivering value for customers at all five stages of their digital maturity curve, be it manual, reactive, responsive, proactive and preventative. this quarter, we bolstered our executive leadership team with two key hires. katherine calvert joined pagerduty as our chief marketing officer, bringing deep experience in brand building and go-to-market execution for award-winning saas companies.
she owns extending our leadership by developing brand awareness, trust and demand for pagerduty's operations cloud in the c-suite and with developers across the world's most innovative start-ups and largest industry leaders. we also appointed shelley webb as the company's new senior vice president and general counsel. shelley fortifies our position around security and privacy. she has deep leadership experience in legal and policy strategy across litigation, contracts, m&a and compliance, while being highly regarded for driving impactful business results with top customers and strategic partners.
in april, pagerduty released our second annual impact report, detailing the company's ongoing commitment to philanthropy, our employee engagement and volunteerism and our esg commitments. in 2021, we deployed funding to more than 660 organizations globally, 75% of which were led by women and leaders of color. 92% of dutonians volunteered time or donated to a cause, resulting in more than 5,000 volunteer hours. we also announced the launch of pagerduty impact labs, a new program that provides funding, product credits, volunteer technical support to time-critical health partners with a specific focus on leveraging our product and technical expertise to ensure critical time-sensitive care to patients in need.
our social impact work also reminds our teams that success for our customers extends beyond financial returns. pagerduty customer, cambridge cognition, is a u.k.-based neuroscience company that quantifies the cognitive health of patients for healthcare organizations. pagerduty enables them to quickly identify suicide risk factors through patient survey data and engage clinicians if patients need immediate attention, while ensuring hipaa and gdpr compliance. using pagerduty, cambridge cognition delivers real value and saves lives.
our mission to revolutionize operations and build customer trust by anticipating the unexpected in an unpredictable world has never been more timely or relevant. given the economic background, companies need to grow profitably by both increasing their velocity and improving their efficiency. we are in the best position at the right time with a proven, resilient, scaled, cloud native platform to address the needs of the digital-first economy. the current environment calls for heightened financial discipline, and we are actively evaluating our expenses to ensure an agile, lean cost structure that supports our ongoing investments in innovation and growth.
we are committed to delivering both durable top-line growth while improving our operating leverage as we scale and to become profitable in q4 and for the full year in fy '24. our focus will remain on customer success. we exist to empower teams with the time and efficiency to build the future. we anticipate sustained demand for our products and services, as our customers seek to efficiently accelerate their digital businesses and more efficiently manage their operations in an evolving macroeconomic climate.
traveling to see our teams and customers has reinforced my confidence in our people, our customers and partners, and our multiple engines for growth. our vision for an equitable world where we transform critical work, so all teams can delight their customers and build trust, is realized more each day. we're excited to share more about pagerduty at our annual summit series beginning on june 7 and encourage our investors to join us virtually. with that, i'll turn the call over to howard, and i look forward to your questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen, and good day to everyone joining us on this afternoon's call. we continued our cadence of strong quarterly execution and delivered rock-solid financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. in an environment of scarce talent and rising costs, the expanding functionality of the pagerduty digital operations management platform covering the full cycle of detection to auto-remediation is allowing customers to revolutionize their operations. overall, the value proposition of our platform in incident response, aiops, customer service ops and automation continues to resonate with customers who are intent on driving innovation, efficiency and productivity.
as we expand our platform, we open up new avenues for both land and add-on opportunities such as with our new process automation releases this past quarter. as i go through our results for the quarter, unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-gaap basis and are reconciled to our gaap results in the earnings release that was posted before the call. revenue was $85 million in the first quarter, up 34% year over year, an acceleration of more than 600 basis points over q1 of the prior fiscal year. international revenues remained sequentially unchanged at 24% of total revenues.
we delivered dollar-based net retention in q1 at 126% compared to 121% in the same period one year ago. this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of dbnr above 120%, and we expect to continue to be at or above 120% throughout this fiscal year. q1 ended with 655 customers with annual recurring revenue or arr over $100,000, up 43% from a year ago. we ended q1 with 15,040 paid customers, up 8% compared to a year ago, our second quarter of sequential increase.
free and paid companies on our platform grew to over 21,000, an increase of 26% year over year, with free continuing to provide a funnel for future paid growth. our q1 gross margin at 84% was once again within our target range of 84% to 86%, and we expect gross margin for q2 to be at a similar level as q1. our operating loss was $2 million or 3% of revenue, an improvement compared to a loss of $6 million or 9% of revenue in the same quarter last year. compared to our first quarter guidance, operating margin was favorable due to improved sales and marketing efficiency and headcount growth shifting materially to the second quarter.
we reiterate our expectations for better than breakeven in q4 and non-gaap profitability in fy '24. one final note on operating margin before moving to cash. the joint venture announced after the close of q1 to establish pagerduty japan with our partner, japan cloud, is expected to reduce full fiscal year operating margin by approximately 100 basis points. now to cash.
first quarter cash from operations was negative $3 million, and free cash flow was negative $6 million. as a reminder, q2 is seasonally our highest cash consumption period due to outflows from espp, annual vendor renewals, payments on the convertible debt and summit. similar to last year, we expect operating cash flow and free cash flow to improve in q3 and q4. turning to the balance sheet.
we ended the quarter with $467 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. the sequential decrease in this metric is from our acquisition of catalytic, which closed during q1. total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $167 million, up 33% year over year. quarterly calculated billings were $82 million, which was an increase of 38% year over year, exceeding the high end of the range we provided during last quarter's call.
this included approximately $3 million of benefit from early renewals and revenue from catalytic. we expect billings growth for q2 to be in the range of 25% to 30%. on a trailing 12 months basis, billings were $344 million, an increase of 34% compared to a year ago and above the estimate previously provided. we expect trailing 12 months billings growth exiting the second quarter to be at or above 30% over last year.
turning now to our guidance. for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $87 million to $89 million, representing a growth rate of 29% to 32%, net loss per share in the range of $0.09 to $0.08 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 88 million. this implies an operating margin in the range of negative 9% to negative 8%. for the full fiscal year 2023, we are increasing revenue guidance to $364 million to $369 million, representing a growth rate of 29% to 31%.
we are improving guidance for net loss per share to $0.21 to $0.17 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 89 million. this implies an operating margin of negative 5% to negative 3%. we continue to deliver strong revenue growth while actively driving efficiencies across the company. we've improved operating margin year over year and will continue to do so each quarter.
ensuring a lean cost structure, so we can continue to fund innovation is a leadership priority. i want to thank our customers for their trust in us and our team for delivering another outstanding quarter of product innovation and go-to-market execution. i remain confident in our business and performance, given the current market demand, the acceleration of our product innovation, strong tailwinds and our consistent execution. with that, i will open up the call for q&a.
unknown speaker
thank you. and to our analysts, please feel free to raise your hand so that you can be added to the queue. and first, we're going to turn to matt hedberg at rbc. let me bring you at, matt.
go ahead.
hey. this is simran biswal for matt hedberg. thanks for taking our question. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the overall demand environment and how you feel about the pipeline in the second half.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for being here today. i'll take this and howard, if you want to add anything, please do. we've continued to see a very strong demand environment.
we haven't seen any change in the demand signals from our customers. i think that is driven by the long-term tailwinds that we've talked about before, digital acceleration, devops transformation and cloud adoption. these digital transformation projects are multiyear projects, and they're going to continue. i'd also say that our customers are looking for solutions that help them automate, reduce their costs, their cash burn and improve their productivity.
and the investments that we've made in innovation over the last several years have really put us in a good position for this moment. and frankly, i'd add that pagerduty really has become a central infrastructure for most of our customers. so we see them continuing to invest and in fact, like i said, double down in areas like event intelligence, customer service ops and automation. so, so far, very consistent demand environment.
unknown speaker
great. thank you.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
pleasure.
unknown speaker
next we'll be going to sanjit with morgan stanley. sanjit, please go ahead.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions. and really very clean and crisp and well-executed quarter in q1. i just wanted to pick up on just how you guys are thinking about a potential slowdown. i think in your script, jen, you said the demand environment looks pretty great to you.
some companies are just trying to embed the risk of a potential slowdown into their guidance. and so maybe, howard, maybe comment on how you are at least encapsulating maybe some of those risks into the guide? and then for jen, the question for you would be around, on one hand, the value proposition is around automation. we have supply demand imbalance between engineers and the number of services that these engineers support, which is sort of the long-term tailwind. at the same time, we're seeing a lot of companies sort of go through layoffs.
if you look at the tech space, the pickup in layoffs over the last three or four weeks has dramatically increased. i'm wondering if you can sort of give us your view as to does that represent a risk to the business in the near term versus what seems like a clear value proposition that you're going to have to automate more to support all of these mission-critical services.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, obviously, we're going to continue to monitor the macro environment very carefully. we're spending a lot of time talking to customers, kind of understanding where they're at. but mostly what i'm hearing in the market is, there's still a very tight talent market for software engineers.
people have moved most of their revenue models to digital experiences. those digital transformation efforts are still well and truly in train and in fact, in some cases, being accelerated, because they deliver long-term cost savings and productivity improvements. so we continue to see this, like i said, strong demand for applications and services that help you improve the productivity of your existing headcount, free them up to focus on important innovation work. and in fact, interrupt work is a big part of the problem, and it's not going to go away regardless of the market cycle we're in.
i've lived through a few of these market cycles. i'm old enough to have been around for 2000 and 2008, etc. and in this case, our customers have stronger balance sheets. they are, like i said, very committed to their digital transformation programs because they are business imperative, and we have become essential infrastructure.
and so we see strong pipeline looking ahead. and we see customers that continue to look to us to help them find ways to improve their productivity and shrink their spend where they can. and that's where we're staying focused. and you can see that in both the stickiness of our platform, gross retention above 95% for years, right, when i talk about essential infrastructure and likewise, strong attach.
but to your point, we, like other companies, are going to be judicious about our expenses and our discretionary spend, really focused on having an agile cost base that we can grow from and remain very committed to both profitability in q4 and for the full year fy '24, but also in continuing to improve our operating leverage as we demonstrate that we are a durable growth company.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i really appreciate the thoughts there. thank you very much.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
my pleasure.
unknown speaker
next we'll hear from matt stotler with william blair. matt, go ahead.
matt stotler -- william blair and company -- analyst
yeah. hey, jen. hey, howard. thanks for taking the questions.
maybe just to start with one on the catalytic acquisition. so you talked about this a little bit already. it seems like a very compelling extension of the workflows that you can address into your finance, hr, supply chain, etc. would love to get maybe just more granular thoughts on how this expands, i guess, effectively your tam or your wallet share within the customer base as well as the stickiness of the platform.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
i can take a just crack at that and then, howard, if you want to jump in. i mean, first of all, one of the things that catalytic does for us is it allows us to increase the flexibility in the workflows for our existing customers. so it brings more applicability and, i think, utility to our incident response teams. and that's super important, because the types of incidents that they're seeing, the capability and the skill sets of the types of people working on those incidents is sort of widely variable.
and so that's super important. but to your point, it also enables us to add users across the business for different types of use cases. and by having flexible no-code workflow offering, it also means that we're not governed by our own ability to create verticalized workflows or products. and so i think that does expand our tam over time.
but we're very focused on making sure that we can continue to grow with our core audience and enable those adjacent teams to start to build for themselves and over time build an ecosystem of different use cases on the platform. and you can start to see early leading indicators of that in our integration ecosystem, where i mentioned we had an integration for a robotics provider this quarter and an integration in data operations. so those things are just starting to build on top of the platform without us having to drive them directly.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i would just add that you'll be able to see some of the ways in which catalytic is already starting to be embedded in our platform at our summit events that start next week. so we're not selling catalytic today as a stand-alone product, but the intent, as we discussed when we did the acquisition, was really to put that technology into the platform and then to be able to drive the different use cases where our customers are already taking us to those different use cases, but this just makes it a whole lot easier.
matt stotler -- william blair and company -- analyst
right. that's super helpful. and then just one follow-up on the partner ecosystem. obviously, you've talked about aws recently.
but i guess, for the past 12, 18 months, we've also had deloitte. tata on the si side, on the isv side, microsoft, salesforce and others. any update on that ecosystem, the influence that ecosystem is having on your business and how you see some of those key partnerships trending going forward?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
we really try and be focused and prioritize key partners. and one of the reasons that we've talked specifically about salesforce, for instance, is because they've been a great partner as we've rolled out our customer service operations offering. so we really look for our partners who are the best in what they do and who have shared values and kind of a shared value proposition where we can go to the market together in a very strategic way. i think our customers have grown to really depend on us for highly reliable, scaled offerings that very quickly deliver return on investment.
and so you'll continue to see us be very focused there. similar with aws, there's an obvious large opportunity around cloud adoption and cloud migration there. and again, shared value set, shared audience, so just a good pairing. and we're going to continue to double down, and likewise, look for opportunities with other partners where it's meaningful for us.
but we -- focus is really important to me right now, keeping our teams focused on the priorities that can deliver near and long-term return on investment, super important.
matt stotler -- william blair and company -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
unknown speaker
ok. next hearing from chad bennett, chad from craig-hallum.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
hey, chad.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
it looks like i'm glowing -- i'm glowing about your quarter, but i'm not really glowing. so...
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
i really like your background, chad. the branding.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. i have to say that, because i know it looks odd. so anyway, yes, i mean, the -- i mean, very clean quarter, like a prior questioner said, and the secondary metrics look like very, very strong. i guess one of the secondary metrics that looked very strong was the customers over $100,000 acv, almost double year over year and uncharacteristically up from q4 sequentially, up like 20% or 10%.
like what -- i mean what kicked in this quarter in terms of that -- for a q1 to come out of the gate, i think that's strong. was there something from a cross-sell, upsell standpoint that obviously kicked up on net retention or just customers just -- cohort graduating up to that $100,000 plus class? like was there something that really triggered that type of strength in a q1?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
i think it's really the consistency with which we're executing. even our transactional business, chad, like so many of our customers start small. they land with a small deal, that -- then those teams expand usage. then it becomes a standard in engineering.
and then they start to look to add new products. they often trade up to digital operations management. and then over time, we see other teams like customer service ops come into play as well. and i think we're just doing a more and more effectively.
if you think about over the last, call it, 12 quarters, all of the innovation and investment that we've talked about, you're starting to see those investments really start to pay out. and i'm just really proud of both our engineering teams and our go-to-market teams, because we pushed them really hard over the last couple of years. and it's great to see the attach rate, more than 50% of our customers have more than two products. it's good to see the multiproduct platform strategy really coming to life.
howard, i don't know if you have anything to add to that?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would add in, as a product-led growth company, i think we're seeing the benefits of that showing up, too, because we've made it easier for customers to make smaller incremental purchases, right? so they don't have to go and do the big tickets purchase like out of the gate. they can do a small purchase, but then they can easily grow with us. so self-service is available to all of our customers, not only in the smb space.
and also we've improved our product -- in-product discovery so that an existing customer, for example, can trial event intelligence and can see whether it makes sense for them. so that also means that it's making multiproduct more accessible. and so that really complements the efforts of the sales team, because now the product is helping do some of the lifting. so the sales team is really being set up well to be able to engage with the customer in something that the customer can already see the value of.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. and then maybe one follow-up with a couple of subsegments for howard. so 126% net expansion popped up. and i think historically, you've always said the main driver of net expansion has always been user growth, right? and -- but we've -- like jennifer said, a ton of product innovation over the last two plus years.
you've got rundeck, you've got aiops, you've got customer service and a lot of things going on, event intelligence and so forth. how do you think about cross-sell, upsell in terms -- or i guess, is it moving the needle on net expansion in a bigger way? and how should we think about that going forward?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so it's still -- you've highlighted the combination of factors. so user expansion is still the most obvious way, because the success with one team often leads us to success with another team. but as we've been able to broaden the platform and to be truly multiproduct, that is playing a bigger part.
so we are seeing an increasing number of customers using multiple products, and that arr coming from multiproduct customers has continued to increase. as we said in the last call the end of q4, we had over 50% of our arr coming from customers with two or more products. so that's definitely proving to be an additional driver from an expansion perspective. but the other dimension not to lose sight of is things like customer service ops, right? we've created like a new land with customer service ops.
we've created a new land with automation. and those effectively are able to come into pagerduty on their own to begin with. and so there's now multiple ways of expanding with pagerduty. it's not as though you have to start in incident response and go from there.
you can actually start in another place and expand from there.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. got it. got it. well, thanks and great job again.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, chad.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
thanks, chad.
unknown speaker
ok. next, we'll hear from shrenik kothari.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
this is shrenik from baird. congrats on a great clean quarter, really great enterprise and middle market execution that you just elaborated on, jen and howard. on first look, the overall paying customer growth is really strong at 88% year-on-year relative to like typical seasonal trends as well. just relative to the 100k customer expansions that you saw really strong, just kind of was wondering, the enterprise and go-to-market execution super solid.
but can you talk about the dynamic at play for like customers, a little down market, are less than 100k. are you seeing more of a macro play on the lower end of the market that we have been hearing from other places, staying at the dynamics? so the top of the funnel is still very strong, growing 26%, as you said, howard, sequentially going to 21,000. so just curious, like is there any macro effects that you see kind of a little bit down market?
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
so when we look at our smb business or our very small business segment, that tends to be tech start-ups. think about it that way. it tends to be smaller companies or smaller teams that are using us for project work. and in fact, in q1, that business was very strong.
we refer to that as pd online internally, and the team there is executing incredibly well. and again, i'd have to attribute much of that to our product-led growth motion. the fact that those very small customers can self-serve, try the product, start it free if that's what they prefer, discover new capability. and then pagerduty very quickly becomes the standard inside of their business and grows with them.
so we haven't seen a change in demand signal there. and in fact, that segment has been performing very robustly.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color, jen. and just one quick follow-up on the international side. you guys have called it out as your key growth driver and source of expansion, and you have taken initiatives there.
that was like essentially flat at 24% of the total, if i heard that right. just wondering like about any forex impact. and like on constant currency, would that look any different or what it would look like? yeah.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. so shrenik, for us as a company, today, most -- well, all of our contracts are in u.s. dollars. so no matter where our customers are, they contract with us in usd.
so foreign -- fx exposure for us is really limited largely to expenses. however, we do look very closely at our customers and whether the change in the -- or the strengthening of the u.s. dollar is having a negative impact, like is it impacting on their ability to buy. and what we've seen to date is that the value that we drive for our customers is just so high that the fact that it's becoming more expensive in local currencies has not had any material impact on their engagement or the demand.
shrenik kothari -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
got it. got it. yeah. thanks, howard.
yeah, thanks and congrats again on the great quarter. appreciate it.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
thank you.
unknown speaker
folks, it looks like that's it for questions today. jennifer, to you for final comments.
jennifer tejada -- chief executive officer
well, i just wanted to first say how confident i am in our future and optimistic i am about our ability to continue to build a durable and overtime a profitable growth company. i also just wanted to recognize our teams for their great execution and our employee resource groups who recently have celebrated asian american and pacific islander heritage month last month and have just kicked off as well pride month at pagerduty. these teams work really hard in addition to their day jobs to make sure that we are celebrating id&e within our company and around our community, and i personally appreciate it. with that, i just want to say thanks to our customers and our shareholders and wish you all a great day.
thanks for being with us today.

during this call we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in our earnings release. further information on these and other factors that could cause the company's financial results to differ materially are included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission, including our most recently filed 10-k and 10-q, as well as our subsequent filings made with the sec. with that, i will turn the call over to jennifer.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
thanks, tony, and thanks everyone for joining us today. we continue to execute well in q2, exceeding the high end of both our top and bottom line guidance ranges. in another quarter of strong growth and improving efficiency, revenue grew 34% year over year and non gaap operating margin improved by more than 1,000 basis points. this is the fourth consecutive quarter at or above 32% growth and an improvement in year-over-year operating margin for pagerduty.
these consistent results illustrate the durability of our growth, our multibillion dollar market opportunity and our adapt -- our ability to capture efficiencies as we scale. at a moment when our customers must ensure seamless digital experiences while improving operating efficiency, pagerduty's operations cloud is essential infrastructure that enables developers to balance both priorities. our platform accelerates their journeys toward greater digital maturity in service of their business goals. we remain on track to deliver non-gaap profitability in q4 this year and for the full -- and full year profitability for next year, fy '24, thanks to continued demand and trust from our customers and partners, as well as the dedication and focus on continuous improvement from our teams around the world.
we are incredibly proud of the trust our customers place in us. arr churn remained below 5% and we achieved the seventh consecutive quarter of dollar based net retention above 120%. the combination of rapid implementation, high return on investment, and an average payback period of two months puts pagerduty in a position of strength, especially in an uncertain macro environment. our land and expand motion drove accelerated year-over-year growth in total paid accounts, as well as in accounts spending more than $100,000 annually with pagerduty.
even with the current macro uncertainty, we see strong demand and in a favorable competitive environment as our teams generated a healthy pipeline across our customer segments and regions. we saw longer sales cycles for some larger deals, often in process automation, and we did experience more diligence on contracts in emea. the digital operations business, however, which includes incident response and ai ops performed exceptionally well, growing faster year-over-year. our primary growth driver remains our high velocity land and expand business which grows consistently and reliably quarter after quarter.
developers continue to champion pagerduty as the devops platform of choice inside their companies. our long term tailwinds, digital acceleration, cloud adoption, and devops transformation remain top priorities for enterprises. digital infrastructures are increasingly complex, interdependent, and central to key business priorities. we have set the enterprise standard for digital operations management, and we continue to expand our competitive advantage through product innovation.
during our hybrid summit series in june, i highlighted the rise of interrupt work across the enterprise. our core developer user base is already familiar with the challenges of keeping digital services running, customer experiences intact, and finding time to innovate. today, pagerduty's operations cloud is uniquely capable of detecting, orchestrating, and automating all types of interrupt work across our customers' digital operations. we connect to tech stacks in every corner of the enterprise, making our platform indispensable for our customers from developers to it, security, and customer service.
the three recent product announcements demonstrate the power of the operations cloud for modern enterprise. first, we made service standards generally available to pagerduty customers. service standards enable organizations to rapidly advance their digital maturity by easily adopting best practices for incident response. developers, sres, service owners, and those responsible for availability and reliability can set up and monitor operational quality standards for service.
second, we announced incident workflows, making our platform more flexible and extensible by enabling rapid design and deployment of no code flexible automated steps for major incident response. many of our customers have asked to customize their incident processes. for instance, creating an incident specific slack channel or starting a zoom call and then sending a status update every 15 minutes. with incident workflows, customers can use an out of the box process or define their own with the building blocks we now provide.
finally, automation actions are now integrated across the entire pagerduty platform. automation capabilities are available at the time when events are first processed and available to all pagerduty users, including customer service teams, to validate, diagnose, and remediate issues without additional human intervention and without needing to wake up the experts to run their specialized scripts. as businesses seek efficiency in their digital operations, while confronted with increasing incidents and leader teams, intelligent automation is essential. both automation actions and incident workflows will be generally available later this year.
the pagerduty ecosystem continues to grow, now above 700 integrations. in august, we launched aws plugins for automated diagnostic actions. these out of the box automations install in minutes and can gather deep telemetry into pagerduty's incidents for aws services. we also launched automation actions applications for salesforce and zendesk.
you'll hear a lot more about the expansion of our customer service operations offering later this month at dreamforce. in q2, a global online travel shopping platform renewed and expanded its relationship with pagerduty after realizing an roi in excess of 300% in the first year. travel continues to trend up 75% year over year in 2022. for travel companies that means opportunities for revenue growth, you have higher stakes in the event of outages and disruptions.
as the company navigates the post pandemic rebound in travel, they renewed for a three year term with more than 5,000 users and joined our customer cohort spending more than $1 million annually. automated incident response enables increased developer productivity and improved availability to ensure great customer experiences. we saw similar trends in global e-commerce, where a leading australian retailer utilizes pagerduty for its service delivery and reliability center of excellence. in q2, the customer grew from 30 to more than 250 users across its e-commerce, data, and customer divisions.
the customer realized a $1 million benefit in productivity gains in just six months through more efficient interactions between employees and customers. with pagerduty's process automation, the retail giant is now able to update thousands of android devices across more than 2,000 stores every night, driving better customer experience and delivering a 400% return on their investment. the thousands of users across these two customers comprise a small portion of more than one million users on our platform today. we currently estimate our total global penetration to be below 5% with a large and growing total addressable market, compelling unit economics, and we continue to invest while improving both operating leverage and our business model.
our state of digital operations report released in june and recent research conducted by idg, both underscore the demand for and benefits of our operations cloud. the problems we solve span the enterprise from developers to it, to security, and customer service teams. industry leaders and innovative start-ups alike across travel and hospitality, financial services, retail software and technology and telecom, all face increasing complexity, more incidents, more disruption and more off hours interruptions. the most digitally mature organizations are better positioned to manage this work and pagerduty advances operations maturity to improve mission critical outcomes.
more mature organizations acknowledge incidents seven minutes faster on average, they mobilize responders 11 minutes quicker, they resolve incidents two hours sooner and they experience 14 fewer hours of downtime every month. for a typical top tier pagerduty customer with an average of 2,500 responders, these time savings translate to better customer experience, annual savings of up to $9 million and a return on investment of 680%. our customers tell us that investments in digital transformation remain mission critical rather than discretionary. we see companies across segments and verticals continue to invest in accelerating the resiliency and maturity of their operations, while improving employee productivity and efficiency in this economic climate.
pagerduty is the platform they trust to power their transformation. tamping the customer leading through innovation, transforming inclusion diversity and equity and building trust are all cornerstones of pagerduty's legacy. during the quarter we earned recognition on several fronts. gigaom and pagerduty are leader in its radar for aiops solutions.
g2 named pagerduty the best incident response platform, including individual award for best usability, best results and best return on investment. fortune magazine named pagerduty one of the best places to work in the bay area. we also welcomed former okta cfo, bill losch to the pagerduty board. bill brings financial expertise, deep enterprise background and an operational understanding of security and of ops.
the shortage for technical talent continues, while demands on developers rise, all while enterprises are under more pressure than ever from customers. for pagerduty this is manifesting a robust market opportunity. our high return on investment solution designed to solve a mission critical problem where customers are losing revenue on every incident is essentially self-funding. we remain confident in our ability to execute, capture share and increase our operational resilience.
we remain focused on sustaining high growth, while accelerating our path to profitability as we progress to our goal of $1 billion of revenue. i want to thank our customers for their trust and loyalty, our partners for their support and our teams for their ingenuity, dedication and drive to solve our customers' greatest challenges. with that, i'll turn the call over to howard and look forward to your questions.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
thank you, jen, and good day to everyone joining us on this afternoon's call. second quarter results demonstrated the strength of our digital operations platform and our operational agility. while sustaining growth of 34%, we accelerated progress against our plans to be profitable in q4. we believe companies want to partner they can trust to innovate and perform at scale in order to enhance the competitiveness of their business.
and that's one pagerduty delivers. as i present our results for the quarter, unless otherwise stated all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-gaap basis and are reconciled to our gaap results in the earnings release that was posted before the call. revenue was $90 million in the second quarter, up 34% year-over-year, the modest acceleration over q2 of the prior fiscal year. international revenues were 23% of total revenues.
we delivered dollar based net retention in q2 of 124% compared to 126% in the same period one year ago. this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of [inaudible] above 120% and we expect to continue to be at or above 120% throughout this fiscal year. q2 ended with 689 customers with annual recurring revenue or arr over $100,000, up 38% from a year ago. total paid customers increased by 7% annually to 15,174 compared to 6% in the year ago period.
free and paid companies on our platform grew to over 22,000, an increase of 23% year over year with free continuing to provide a funnel for future paid growth. q2 gross margin of 84% remained within our target range of 84% to 86%. our operating loss was $3 million or negative 4% of revenue, an improvement compared to a loss of $10 million or negative 15% of revenue in the same quarter last year. compared to our second quarter guidance, operating margin outperformed as we accelerated our scaling initiatives and lower than expected in quarter program expenses.
as jen noted, we expect to deliver a better than breakeven q4 and a profitable fy '24. now to cash, second quarter cash from operations was $3 million compared to a loss of $12 million in q2 of last year. free cash flow was $1 million, compared to an outflow of $13 million in the year ago period. both cash measures were better than expected primarily due to three factors: a mixture of collections that have shifted from the first quarter to q2, as well as modest reduction in dsos, working capital favorability and lower overall expenses.
for the second half we expect free cash flow to be slightly negative in q3 and breakeven or better in the fourth quarter. turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $471 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $170 million, up 27% year over year. quarterly calculated billings were $92 million, which was an increase of 23% year over year, ending below the 25% to 30% range provided during last quarter's call.
an elongation of sale cycles reduced our initial expectations for bookings, which was more common with high dollar opportunities. europe also experienced a bit more softness in other geographies. we expect billings growth for q3 to be in the range of 20$to 25%. this range extrapolates july trends into q3, which we feel is appropriate given the uncertain economic environment.
on a trailing 12 months basis billings were $361 million, an increase of 30% compared to a year ago and met the estimate previously provided. we expect trailing 12 months billings growth exiting the third quarter to be at or above 20% over last year. turning now to our guidance and factoring in the current economic conditions. for the third quarter fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $92 million to $94 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 31%.
net loss per share attributable to pagerduty, inc. in the range of negative $0.04 to negative $0.03 with basic shares outstanding of approximately $89 million. this implies an operating margin in the range of negative 4% to negative 3%. for the full fiscal year 2023, we now expect revenue in the range of $365 million to $370 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 31%.
we are improving guidance for net loss per share attributable to pagerduty, inc. to $0.12 to $0.10 with basic shares outstanding of approximately $89 million. this implies an operating margin of negative 3% to negative 2%. before i close, i would like to thank our customers for their continued partnership and for our teams across the globe who champion them.
our rapid pace of innovation is designed to actualize our vision to transform critical work and revolutionize operations. we remain confident in our business and performance as we continue to scale toward non-gaap profitability. with that, i will open up the call for q&a.

operator
thank you so much, howard. and we will bring jen up on the screen with you. [operator instructions] keith weiss, we are going to come to you first, you can go ahead with your question, please.
unknown speaker
excellent. thank you guys for taking the question, very nice quarter. and really nice progress on profitability. just kind of feel good to a positive free cash flow coming in [inaudible] system.
i wanted to ask about the guide and sort of the conservatism in that guide. i think that's a key question a lot of investors are wondering about. our numbers coming down low enough. so howard, i was wondering if you could talk us through kind of the guidance methodology, where is there excess conservativism? how can we get comfortable that this is like the right guide for the full year is not going to come lower.
and then on the other side of the fence, how much flexibility is there on opex to protect that path toward profitability and sustain that profitable stance for fy '24? is there room to [inaudible] opex down further just to sustain that or you need these investment levels for the long term and this is kind of where you're going to be investing on a go-forward basis? thank you.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, thanks, keith. there's a lot in that question. so i'll try to unpack that piece by piece.
so at the -- i think what i would say is, from a guidance perspective we haven't changed our approach. what we are looking at when we contemplate the rest of the year. we know that the tailwinds that have always driven our business remain the tailwinds. weather that's digital acceleration, devops transformation or cloud adoption or cloud migration, those still remain true.
and so, we are seeing a strong demand signal and we are balancing that with some of the elongation we're seeing in sales cycles for larger deals. so we have factored into our guidance for the full year from a -- sorry, as you can see from the billings perspective that there is some duration extension in terms of deals. and just as a reminder, most of our deals actually close within 90 days. whereas the larger deals of course can take longer and those are the ones that we're seeing are being subject to increased scrutiny or may be high levels of diligence.
the deals are still there, but it's just the process of prioritization of that work is changing. so we're seeing a little bit of that and we factored that into the view that we've taken from a topline perspective. what i would say in terms of from an opex and from an efficiency perspective, this is not something new for us in terms of how we've been thinking about the path to profitability. we have been progressively over the last few quarters, and you've heard me talk about this, in thinking about how do we put in place structural change that helps us be more efficient.
so this is not just a one-off event. so we've been using an increasing amount of automation within our g&a functions. we've been creating incremental capacity through exploring options for lower cost like patients and we rapidly ramping in those areas. so that allows us to build capacity that we need to drive the business.
so a number of initiatives on that front too to help us have confidence in the view the we expense around q4 being profitable on a non-gaap basis and setting us up to be the profitable on a non-gaap basis next year.
unknown speaker
got it. if i could sneak one in for jen, just on the competitive environment. it seems like some of the it operations management vendors and itsm vendors out there are talking more about incidents response and trying to kind of close the loop and help close the loop for their customers. is there any change that you're seeing in the competitive environment or is the digital operations platform that you guys are putting out that are just so far ahead of what the more basic functionality that some of these guys have, that is not really competitive environment as of yet?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
i think the operative word in your question is talking, there is a lot of talking about participating in this market. there always has been and i say this -- i feel like i've said this every quarter going to say it again. i've never seen a more favorable competitive environment, because we continue to expand our lead from our product differentiation perspective and build on a long-standing foundation of trust around resiliency. and when you then look at our 700 integrations, we've just built a number of deep moats from purely a product perspective.
in this environment, i think that becomes even more important, because resiliency and availability of the customer service to capture every penny of revenue coming in the door matters as does productivity and efficiency of those workers. because while i think retention for us has -- of employees and technical employees has improved, the talent market is definitely getting better. i would say technical talent for our customers is still at a huge shortage. and so they want to improve that productivity and make sure those folks are working on product, are working on customer facing initiatives and that they're not losing time, trust and revenue through major incidents.
unknown speaker
outstanding. thank you so much.
operator
ok. next going to joel fishbein with truist. joel, we will bring you on.
joel fishbein -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, thank you for taking my questions and excellent execution and congrats to you guys. i wanted to ask about the roi story that you are telling jennifer. i thought that was pretty intriguing and i know you called out two customers, but i think that there's probably a lot more that you can talk about. can you talk about how you're measuring roi and what they're using prior to beginning in pagerduty and helping us with that, because i think that that really tells the story and the importance of maybe weathering through some of this choppy tape that none of us can control that would be helpful.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
for sure, and i think one of the appeals of saas platforms is that, they're easier to deploy, right? there are more intuitive. and in the case of pagerduty were designed almost like a consumer application, but with an enterprise infrastructure and back-end sitting behind it. and i think where that lends itself in an environment like this is our customers see an incredible -- incredibly fast implementation. it's not like trying to deploy a huge traditional enterprise software platform over years, which is like pushing a wheelbarrow uphill.
right? this is more happens within hours, days, and weeks as opposed to years. we see almost immediate roi. i mean, we recently ran a bake off against another competitor at a customer, and they saw an improvement in mean time to acknowledge and mean time to respond 50% over the other provider without doing any customizations in the first few days of having it up and running. and so that immediate roi leads to a lot of trust.
the payback period is on average two months. the example that i shared with you there is based on our top 100 customers, our larger customers that have made significant investments that then see those very significant returns in a short period of time. and i think that lends itself to -- lends itself well to customers that are looking for immediate roi, immediate improvement and efficiency, that they can measure and quantify. right? so we're putting our money where our mouth is.
and you tend to see that return come from a couple of different areas: one, just reducing the amount of manual work that developers have to undertake so they get back to innovation; two, you reduce the time lost to incidents and the revenue risk during those outages. and we've as consumers who become heavily reliant on on-demand services have seen how quickly you can lose loyalty and lose money and lose subscribership when that happens. right? and then i'd say the last area is we're also helping our customers consolidate some of their providers because we give them one view of all of their observability tools in an automated way to orchestrate work across their teams, and the ability to close the loop in not just responding to, but resolving an issue and learning from it. and that's really driven by all of the automation that we built into our platform.
joel fishbein -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
thank you. nice to see you, joel.
operator
ok. thank you. and next, we'll move to matt hedberg. matt is with rbc.
please go ahead.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks a lot. jen, you said something interesting. you said we're part of the mission critical infrastructure for a lot of organizations.
and i think in time maybe more it scrutiny, can you can you double click on that? just because i think it's a really important point.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
matt, i think what you asked is, you're hard to hear. i think you asked about my comments around being part of a mission critical decision. and i also have talked about essential infrastructure and drilling into what that means. is that right?
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's correct.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
ok. so when you think about incident response, right, it's become more and more important to our customers because their consumers, their end users demands have risen. they're less patient when something goes wrong. they will quickly switch the cost of change for them, particularly in the consumer space is much lower.
so they'll switch to a competitor if their experience is not good. and as i mentioned, to joel's question, like, revenue can be lost very quickly. and so, availability and uptime, reliability of the digital products and services that really define your brand, but also deliver your revenue has become if not job one, job two, right up there with security is the way i would think about it. and it's getting harder and harder to manage, so most of our customers are seeing an increasing number of incidents because they're dealing with more complexity in their infrastructure, in their digital operations environment.
and i'd even argue that with the great resignation of the past, there's also a lot of new employees in organizations, so ramping employees to understand the technology gets harder. so anywhere you can automate the work to detect issues before they become revenue impacting incidents, to manage those incidents well when they do occur, and to learn from them and prevent that very costly incident from happening in the future is a really important investment and not something that we're seeing our customers back away from at this moment. the second thing that i would say is, developers actually care deeply about the kinds of tools they're asked to use in their environment. and if you put them on a mission critical job and say, this product can never go down, this platform must be available all the time to our users to our customers.
but then you say, here's some crappy tools, we're going to have you manage this with an excel spreadsheet and phonetree. like, they get very unhappy. so a lot of our developer community, champion pagerduty, all the way through their senior management because they trust that they want to work with it, and it enables them to do their jobs more effectively. and so, again, in the talent war that we've been in it's really important to make sure that your technical community has the products and services they want to use and that will enable them to be more effective and more productive in their jobs.
and the one thing i loved about pagerduty when i first learned about it, when i joined over six years ago was how quantifiable the roi is, how easy it is to identify the ways that we reduce in terms of employee productivity, the efficiency that we create in terms of how employees identify and address and learn from incidents that happen. but most important, the way it can improve revenue generation and protect revenue in terms of managing the customer experience.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's super helpful. and maybe it was a nice segue into my second question. you talked about the importance of uptime and reliability, and you also said the competitive environment has ever been better. i think one of your larger competitors had an outage at some point here not long ago.
when things like that happen does that bring even more customer inquiry your way?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
all software is imperfect, and everybody has outages and incidents. and so, we try and live up on the high road when it comes to talking about these sort of issues. but for sure, trust in a platform like ours is paramount. and i think it only takes a single incident that isn't well responded to leave a customer wondering if they have the right partner and that, of course, creates opportunities for us.
having said that, i think that there are other ways to identify customers and we've certainly seen customers coming to us because of the influx and demand for a platform that does more than just on call. right? more than just moving the work around, actually automating the work itself, actually helping customers become proactive and prevent incidents from happening, not just responding from them -- responding to them faster, but truly resolving them and preventing them from causing new problems in the future. and that's where when i talk about expanding our lead through innovation, we started in in call many, many years ago, 13 years ago, we added automated incident response. we built on top of that aiops, including analytics, and then deployed automation into almost every part of our platform.
and this is the automation of complex challenges in a business. it's not like robotic process automation where you're simply automating workflows or mundane tasks. we're actually learning from the events that flow through those 700 integrations and enabling teams to get better and better with each incident that occurs.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, jen. congrats on the results.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
thank you, matt.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. and as we near labor day, we've got some folks on the road. [operator instructions] next, we're going to hear from rob oliver over at baird. rob, come on and join us.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. can you guys hear me ok?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
yeah. nice to see you. how are you, rob?
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. i'm doing well. how are you? just my question is actually for you.
and just a little bit more color around some of your commentary relative to emea and some of those elongated sales cycles? there certainly appears like there's an element of counter cyclicality to your business, which is solid. on the other hand, you guys are not immune to some of these macro impact. so i'm wondering, in terms of more color, was that new logos? was it expansions? and anything else you might add there? and then on top of that, obviously, in this time would you guys david justice has done a great job. and are there any adjustments or changes on the flag that you're seeing your team make to adjust to this new environment?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
well, the first thing i'd say is, i'm super encouraged by the demand that we continue to see. really strong demand and strong pipeline for all of our products and services. and i think that's a tribute to having a product led growth strategy, right? where our product actually drives a lot of the demand. i'm excited because we welcomed a new cmo into the business, katherine calvert, and she's been with us for about a quarter.
we saw -- continue to see really great execution around our velocity of land and expand motion, that's become very predictable and reliable for us. and the digital operations business, the incident response and aiops performed exceptionally well during the quarter. in emea what we saw is, some additional diligence on deals, and i think that's really driven by kind of the combination of inflation, a very strong us dollar and the ongoing conflict in russia, which is creating just a lot of uncertainty there. from a large deal perspective, we still saw large deals closing and we didn't lose large deals, but what we saw was some of our large deals taking a little bit longer.
and remember, that most of our typical sales cycles are around 90 days. so i know a lot of software companies are talking about longer. i'm not talking about months and years, i'm talking about days. so -- but it is notable and it is something for us to be aware of.
i think in thinking about how our leadership team has responded to this, we really stayed on the court that we've been on since the early days of covid. and by the way, i'll mention that this macro uncertainty, while it is, a little tricky, it's nothing compared to what we saw in the first quarter of covid. our customers have a plan in place, they know how to run in a hybrid environment, they've got products and services to sell and jobs to do, and they're still up against a pretty challenging talent shortage. and so, very different than that environment.
and so our team is really staying the course with the plan that says we're going to continue to improve our efficiency, we're going to invest in sustainable high growth. we're going to continue to invest in innovation to expand the lead that we have today. and a lot of that is around the area of automation throughout the platform and including our process automation. so we're really -- i think the plans that we put in place over the last several quarters have put us in a very strong position, both from a competitive perspective and from the perspective of dealing with whatever is coming our way.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. that's really helpful color. i just got a very quick follow-up, howard, for you. just -- i know you've already added some color around lowering quarter expenses.
but could you add maybe a bit more around some of those sources of margin leverage, where they're coming from, whether it be hiring buildings infrastructure, other areas where you guys have the ability to kind of accelerate that path to profitability nicely? appreciate it. thank you, guys.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
rob, so the areas that we've seen, as i mentioned, the one is really being a focus around sales productivity, how do we make it easier for our salespeople to sell and how do we create capacity globally to be able to support that sales motion. and getting the balance right between quota and non-quota carrying folks is the way that we look about that -- look at that. so in fact, q2 was a record hiring quarter for us, so we've continued to hire, but we've been doing so with a very intentional approach. we're certainly gaining leverage through the use of automation within a number of our functions, particularly within the g&a functions, which is certainly helping us get the work done without having to add headcount at the same rate.
so that's a positive for us. and also our location strategy opening up and the offices in lisbon and in chile, those have also helped us have access to a broader talent market and also allowing us to use and follow the sun model more effectively. and all of these are little elements of efficiency that are structural that are there for the long term. and so, the changes that we're seeing and that we've been making around making our organization more resilient, our organization structures more agile are really setting us up for the future.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
thank you both.
operator
ok. thank you. we will go next to chad bennett with craig hallum. chad, welcome.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so just following up on the last question, i'm not sure if i heard the answer or not, just on -- jennifer on the elongated sales cycles on the enterprise side and then maybe the emea issues [inaudible] additional kind of sign offs you saw there. but again, was that more new logo driven or expansion driven?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
no. generally, i think on the expansion side of things, i mean, that's where our sales team spends the vast majority of their time. but again, i just -- for context, when we talk about some of our larger deals taking longer to close, it doesn't necessarily mean they're an enterprise. right? because we do a lot of -- some of our biggest enterprise customers grow by starting small and seeing multiple pos over time.
and i think that is one of the benefits of our business that makes us resilient in this environment as we don't need huge deals in any segment to be successful.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. and it just -- because if you look at the 100,000 plus customer growth, it's -- i'm not sure kind of what internal expectations were, but it looked pretty solid year over year. and so just trying to reconcile and also if you think about not that you guide for quarterly billings or you guide for quarterly billings, but we don't know what your guide would have been for this quarter, all else equal. i mean the 20% to 25% growth versus maybe a 25% to 30% in normal times, is that kind of 5% delta.
again, you don't guide, but 5% delta. is that encompassing kind of everything you're seeing today or you saw in the quarter? or is it assuming things get even a little bit worse. is there any color there? thank you.
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so chad, i'll jump in on that one. the approach that we've taken there is that, in the back half of the last quarter we started seeing a little bit of this effect for some of these deals. and to jen's point, a lot of those customers -- we saw 38% growth in customers above 100,000, a lot of those customers get above 100,000 if they are doing lots of smaller deals.
so our high velocity transaction business across all segments remained strong. what we did see is that some of those larger deals took longer. and so, in coming up with our estimate with respect to billings for this quarter, we did extrapolate some of the extension in duration that we had started to see into the view that we have given.
chad bennett -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color. i appreciate it. nice job on the quarter.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
thanks, chad.
operator
ok. next, we have andrew sherman with cowen. andrew, please go ahead.
andrew sherman -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys. how are you doing?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
it's andrew on for derrick. nice corner. so, jen, you're going to sell mostly into developers, but also customer service. does it feel like budget priority within the developer and devops arena is more resilient than other buying centers? and what's your sense on where budget priorities are the highest right now?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
i don't think we've seen like a shift in demand or budget across our different personas. but i think that's more about the problems we solve per se than the personas themselves. because i think one of the things that's really changed in the last few years is our customers really understand all the way up to the ceo and in some cases the board, the audit committee, that incidents cost them a lot of money. some that's really measurable in the immediate term and some that's measurable in the long term.
and when i think about this, the long term tailwinds that we've always talked about have remained well intact in this environment. and that's digital acceleration, cloud adoption and devops transformation. no one is stopping or slowing their projects in those areas because they remain critical to the business. the other thing is because of the more than 700 applications and monitoring systems, observability, cloud providers that we connect to, we're really well stitched into our customers.
we become essential infrastructure. and i think that shows up in our gross retention and in our low churn and increasingly in our net dollar retention. and as i mentioned before, unlike in covid where we saw a lot of different buying centers just freeze to try and take stock and recover in the early days of this sort of covid market impact. we're not seeing that behavior.
now having said, i've worked in erp, i've worked in supply chain, i've worked in a lot of other parts of software over my career. i would not want to be selling discretionary apps or apps that are a feature, not a not a product, not a platform, and don't solve, like i said, these mission critical problems. i think things related to incident response, security, customer service, like customer experience are going to continue to be really important in this environment because most of our customers' revenue generation has moved to their digital products and services. and so it's just become more important for them.
andrew sherman -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks. and then howard, i wanted to ask about the price hikes and if there's any contribution from that in the back half implied in guidance. and i think 20% of customers are billed monthly.
so did that have any impact to q2? and how should we think about the impact of those rolling in over the next few quarters?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
sure. so on the pricing side, there are three dimensions to this, we introduced a price increase back in march, which was primarily for new customers to the platform, so related to new customer acquisition and that is fully in play and has had a positive impact. we also introduced modest increases on renewal, which we spoke about last quarter and that's again in process and working well and that's factored into our view through the end of the year. and i think then on your -- what is your final point there? final question that you had, andrew.
andrew sherman -- cowen and company -- analyst
the impact of how the roll out over the next two quarters?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think those are both in train. they're continuing to -- they make a business that are working well. and the value that we deliver to our customers is really obvious, the roi information that jen shared in her prepared remarks means that the value we deliver to customers is high and so we're not seeing any resistance.
andrew sherman -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew.
operator
ok. thank you. [operator instructions] matt stotler, we're going to come over to you. matt with william blair.
please go ahead.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
very good to see you. thanks for taking the questions. maybe just one to start off with on the kind of free to pay customer conversion. obviously, you guys have talked about specific rates, but are you seeing any change in that rate of conversion or the ability to convert customers in this environment? do you have any thoughts on how it's going to turn going forward?
howard wilson -- chief financial officer
yes. so, matt, this has always been like a long term program for us in terms of how we thought about free and the conversion, capturing developers early in their use of pagerduty or other potential responders and then making sure that they have such a good experience if they convert. and we've seen -- in terms of new customer acquisition, we've seen good healthy trends. and so that funnel is still working for us.
we take a long term view on that though, because we know that our expectation isn't that we've seen like rapid transition in terms of free. but when we look at our mid-market and enterprise segments, which free has allowed us to focus on, we saw really strong customer acquisition in the mid-market and the enterprise with this last quarter.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. and then maybe just a quick follow-up on the partner ecosystem. obviously, not a huge contributor today, but something that you guys have talked about as being a place where you're investing.
as you kind of look forward and look to be maybe a little, i guess, look for efficiencies as you continue to invest in and go to market going forward, how does the partner channel fit into that? and what are you prioritizing in this environment on that side of things?
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think we've talked in the past about our partnerships with aws and salesforce, particularly around devops for aws and then our customer service ops solution for salesforce. those will continue to be both product and go to market partners that are important to us and that we're spending a lot of time with. i mentioned dreamforce, i think on the call, and we'll also be spending quite a bit of time at reinvent.
i always tell andy and adam that reinvent is like where our people are. it's like coming into our own village, all the developers there. but we also think about our technology partners, so we talk about integrations every quarter. i think sometimes it's easy to underestimate how expansive that is for our ecosystem.
the fact that we don't have to build all those integrations that a customer may have a use case and use our api to build their own integrations which then opens opportunity up for other customers and users. and so that will continue to be an important area of investment for us. and then increasingly as we look at expanding into new regions and new verticals, partners become more and more important. so we have put a venture together with a partner in japan to try and accelerate our expansion into that market for instance.
but i would say that we try to be very focused in this area as opposed to sort of the spray and prey model, because in my experience, a lot of a lot partner efforts have been measured by activity, not output. and i'm really looking to figure out how we impact our overall customer experience and grow the effectiveness and efficiency of our go to market organization by having the right blend between direct and channel partnership.
matt stotler -- william blair -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
jen tejada -- chief executive officer
