thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from simon leopold from raymond james. please go ahead. hello, simon, is your line muted?
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
sorry about that, yes, i was muted. you think, i'd know by now. so thanks for taking the question. hopefully, the folks in texas are thawing out and recovering from last week, i saw that on the news, sorry to hear about that. what i wanted to ask first about was specifically the new cable customer. so i am intrigued by this, i want to get a better understanding, when you talk about a new customer, is this a u.s. operator that is new to aoi or is this a new customer from outside the u.s. and what's the nature of the deployment, is it a daa or some other application?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure, simon. first of all, thank you for your comments regarding all this down in texas. it's thawing out nicely, we've -- we had a little bit of a rough week last week, but it's back to back to normal now, so i appreciate your kind words on that. with respect to the cable tv customer, it is a -- it's not a brand new customer, they've been with us for roughly a year, it is a u.s.-based company, they're a manufacturer or reseller of cable tv equipment and they are supplying primarily u.s. -- well, almost entirely u.s. and well, let's just north american msos with gear for upgrade projects. the specific products that we're selling to them right now are useful in both daa and traditional applications and i think that probably the deployments that are going on there are a combination of both of those types of technologies.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
and i guess, i'd like to get a understanding of how you're thinking about the broader trend in your cable tv market in that? i recall speaking about this a couple of quarters ago, at which point you thought that maybe in the construction season spring to summer 3q '21 you'd be getting back to kind of mid-teens revenue, i want to recheck where you're thinking today about the cadence of your cable business through '21.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i think we probably can be significantly higher than that level later on in the year. we're sitting right now on the strongest backlog of cable tv products i think we've ever had. and as i've noted in our prepared remarks, this was the best -- the fourth quarter was the best quarter in cable that we've had in several years. so where we're standing right now i think i see pretty strong performance in the cable segment through -- certainly through q3 and probably through the end of the year.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. and then, maybe just one last one for me, if i might, is on your datacenter business, particularly the hyperscalers, i appreciate that quarterly visibility can be a little bit difficult, but what sort of linearity or expectations do you have for the full year? and part of my question goes back to the capital spending forecast look like high-teens to maybe 20% spending growth by the group as a whole, i just want to understand if that's a good indicator for the kind of growth rate we should think of for your business in that vertical? thanks.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i think it's difficult to draw a direct line between capital expenditures on the part of the hyperscale operators and our revenue. i mean, if you looked at our revenue in that segment over the years, it -- there's probably some high level correlation, sort of a macro-correlation, but it's very difficult certainly to draw any conclusion on a quarter-by-quarter or even annual basis really from those capex numbers. for us, in particular, i think a lot depends on the trajectory of 400 gig. as we mentioned, we do see 400 gig contributing revenue in the second half of the year and depending on exactly how soon and how fast that comes on and the trajectory of 100 gig as that occurs, that will kind of dictate our results in the year. so i can't give you firm guidance for the year on that, but i don't think it's reasonable to draw correlation directly from the overall capex in the market.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
i appreciate that. thanks for taking the questions.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, simon.
operator
the next question is from paul silverstein from cowen. please go ahead.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
good afternoon. i trust from your response to the last question that your visibility in terms of what has been communicated to you by your varied status from the customers that it's relatively limited at this point or is that not the case? let me ask the question more openly -- in a more open way, what has been the communication from those customers, if anything?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
well, ok. so there's -- i guess there's two issues that we've been communicating significantly with our customers regarding -- one is, the sort of near term trajectory of the inventory draw-down to the extent that those customers have that situation. i would emphasize, it's not all of our datacenter customers that had too much inventory, it's limited to a couple of them. but with those customers, we've certainly had ongoing discussions about their inventory and relative to that, i would say our expectations continue to be in line with what we said on our last earnings call, and in our prepared remarks today, which is that we see that inventory correction persisting through q1 and then resolving itself in q2. so that's one area of discussion and i think that's largely unchanged from our previous expectations.
the second area where we've had some significant discussion with these customers or all of our datacenter customers really is around their 400 gig or i should say maybe 200 gig and 400 gig plans and i think those discussions, particularly with the customers who are implementing 400 gig continue to progress well as we noted in our prepared remarks. we continue to see more active cadence of discussions, questions now are moving -- in many cases are moving less from into sort of technical -- detailed technical specifications and topics like that into questions about capacity ramp up, timeframe for availability, things like that that would be in my mind, more indicative of a hardening of their plans to deploy in the second half of the year. and so those discussions i think have been quite positive as well.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. i assume it -- well, i assume it goes without saying, it's way too early to think about what pricing will look like?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, i mean i can't give you any firm guidance on that. i mean, it's certainly a topic of discussion as well with the customers. yeah, i don't have a -- i don't have an indication on when that will play out at this point, too early to say.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. i appreciate it. i'll pass it on, guys.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, paul.

[operator instructions] the next question is from samik chatterjee from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
samik chatterjee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my question. if i can just start off on the 400 gig wins and you mentioned in the press release that you're seeing customer interest. i'm just wondering, what are your expectations in terms of timing of deployment because i'm just thinking if deployments are in the second half as most of the industries telegraphing at this point. should we expect to see more acceleration in wins on 400 gig i think as far as the number you've announced one win at this point. so just help me think about what the pace of design wins should look like if you're expecting deployment in the second half or is that not really the case in terms of deployment timing right now?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i don't -- i wouldn't say it's late to hear on those wins at this point. we are having discussions with customers about our capacity ramp-up plans in the second half of the year. and so, i don't think they're feeling pressure right now that if they don't announce a win or something like that, that we're not going to be ready to go, they know our plans. so i would say that we -- in order to meet the plans that customers are indicating to us now, i would expect that we would have to have design wins by -- certainly by the end of q2 or very early q3. but it -- now, it's not alarming that we don't have more wins at this point in my mind.
samik chatterjee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, and then, just a follow quick follow up. i think you mentioned on the slowdown that you've seen related to china telecom, you are starting to see that move up sequentially in 1q. just wondering is that more -- are you hearing anything that's more driven by the supply chain having worked through the restrictions on huawei or is it that the supply chain is being offered to other customers and you are having to customize the product for other customers who have been deployed in the network?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, that's a really good question. i want to use that opportunity to try to make sure that we're crystal clear on what we're trying to say regarding huawei. it is not our intention to try to say that huawei's ban necessarily caused any disruption to our customers' ability to deploy their networks. what we are saying is that there was significant uncertainty because of the speed and the unexpected nature of the huawei ban that our customers had to take a pause in their deployment plans to reassess whether those plans were still able to be achieved either with huawei or with an alternative source.
so it wasn't so much that we -- that customers had to necessarily scramble to find alternative sources. it was simply that they had to take a time out, if you will, to figure out and make sure that whatever they -- whatever plans they had didn't need to be changed in light of the huawei ban. so that being said, what we have seen as you indicated and as we indicated in our prepared remarks is that some of our customers have begun to recover in the sense that we are seeing increased order flow related to 5g in china and the customers that haven't yet begun to place orders are talking to us about placing orders. so we're feeling fairly comfortable now that we will see some recovery in q1, and then probably more activity in q2, q3, and probably toward the end of the year.
now what we're hearing from our sources in china is that we still expect a pretty sizable increase in the number of towers, and therefore the amount of optics that's used in those 5g networks in 2021 compared 2020, we expect the number of towers deployed to be anywhere from 60% to 80% higher than what we saw in 2020 and that would indicate a similar increase in the number of optics that are deployed. so we're pretty bullish on china 5g in the year albeit getting off to somewhat of a slow start, but certainly better than what we saw in q4.
samik chatterjee -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. no, thank you. thanks for the insight.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
no problem.
operator
the next question is from ryan koontz from rosenblatt securities. please go ahead.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for the question. quick question on your strength in the cable tv segment there. your cable capex not really doing a whole lot but you guys doing well, do you attribute that more to share gains in the optical new designs or do you attribute it more to a mix change of spending by the msos on more node splitting? any thoughts there? thank you.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
oh, yeah, i think it's both. we have been spending a lot of time and effort developing a new line of cable tv products, including some amplifier products and other node sub-assemblies and things like that related to these rollouts. so we've expected for some time that these rollouts would start to occur and we've engineered our products accordingly. so i do believe that we're picking up market share from what we had, let's say, in the previous deployments that had happened several years ago, but i also believe that the msos -- the observation that i have and aoi has been in the cable tv business now for nearly 20 years, 18, 19 years...
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
sure, yeah.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
and the observation that i have is the cable capex generally doesn't change that much, but the areas where the cable msos spend their capex can change dramatically. so i think right now, we're seeing a shift from spending in sort of central office and maybe certain cpe type applications...
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
yes.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
to investing in the network. so i think it's a combination of both and the related, right. we develop products because we felt that the msos based on their feedback were going to shift they're spending and start building on the outside plant again, and indeed that's what we've seen happen. so it's a combination of share gains and shift in spend.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
yeah. do you think some of what your differentiation is around expanding the addressable spectrum in the plant and looking for more upstream capacity? i mean, i imagine there is some kind of design...
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
definitely.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
changes...
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
and requirements you have to meet.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. no, absolutely. i mean, the deployments that we're aware of and the equipment that our customers are purchasing for those deployments are squarely aimed at increasing the amount of bandwidth and as you indicated specifically, the amount of bandwidth in the return path direction. that's an absolute...
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
yeah.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
requirement for most of these deployments.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
super helpful, stefan. thanks so much. congrats on the quarter.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
all right. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question is from tim savageaux from northland. please go ahead.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
hey, good -- pardon me. good afternoon. first question for me is on the kind of overall topic of diversifying customer base and you mentioned you need 10% customer in cable tv, you've also apparently got some new 8% customers, i think, thanks to some very helpful and transparent disclosure in your filing. on the datacenter side, i wonder if we might get some similar commentary and i thought that was great color you gave on the cable tv customer. i assume one of your datacenter operators is just another cloud titan whose name we haven't discussed yet, but what on the network equipment supplier -- i'd be interested if you had any color on the application there whether that's kind of a client interface for router type application or a switch guy heading the datacenter? any color you might be able to add on this new pretty significant customers.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, it's a switch vendor who's selling largely into datacenter. so some hyperscale, a lot of tier 2 and some enterprise.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
okay, on the nem side. and then, in terms of the direct datacenter operator, any color there or should we assume it's one of the bigger guys that have not been discussed in the past?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
it's a fairly large datacenter operator, u.s. based.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
got it. and congrats on that diversification. with regard to the potential recovery in the datacom business, and i think you mentioned a couple of separate issues around 100 gig inventory and i think it's notable that your 40 gig business has gotten so small, but -- and then, the up -- potential uptake and inventory situation there and a potential uptake of 200 or 400 gig, is there a potential relationship there, number one, i guess, between inventory digestion at 100 and preparation for a ramp at 200 and 400? and as you look at your q1 guide in particular, that's sort of flattish to slightly down, it seems like telecom should be up, it seems like cable could be as well. so are you expecting that datacenter business to decline slightly and bottom out in q1, and then recover as a result of perhaps both of those factors, 100 gig recovering and initial 200 or 400?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, i think your characterization in terms of datacenter spend sort of bottoming out in q1 is probably accurate. i would caution, q1 when it comes to cable tv in q1, just keep in mind that our cable tv production is largely done in our china factories, so we do have the lunar new year holiday and so our capability in terms of just broad number of days to produce product in the cable tv segment is limited in q1 compared to other segments. now, we have pretty strong demand, i mentioned earlier about the backlog. so -- and also this year in china, relative to other years, we had a lot more of our employees stay, either stay in the factory or at least nearby as opposed to returning to their homes, largely that's due to covid and the chinese government's discouragement of traveling long distances in -- for fear of spreading the disease.
so i think that we're on track to have a somewhat better result relative to chinese new year than we have in years past. but nevertheless, we do have at least a week where we can produce product in china and that product is largely and that's where most of these cable tv products are manufactured. so when you talk about cable tv likely to be up, the demand is certainly there, but again, our ability to deliver there is somewhat constrained in q1, but we do expect, like i said, both in our prepared remarks and really in our last earnings call as well, that the 400 gig contribution will begin to ramp in the second half of the year and i think that will certainly -- if we're successful in getting those wins and we start to see that ramp and that will certainly contribute to revenue.
i don't believe that that has anything to do right now with the slowdown in 100 gig, i believe that the slowdown in 100 gig is related more to -- i mean, we saw a very large volume of purchases of 100 gig in the middle part of last year because of covid. well, i mean, it was because of the shift to -- it was a combination of the shift to working from home, driving demand and fears that our customers had whether those fears were well-placed or not that there would be supply chain disruptions -- significant supply chain disruptions because of covid.
i think the working from home trend certainly played out, there was a lot of demand that was caused by that working from home, but i don't believe that our customers saw the magnitude of supply chain disruptions that they were fearful of and therefore by the end of the year, the inventory levels that they had accumulated were no longer necessary to support what they thought to be a tough patch in terms of their supply chain. so i think that's really why we saw a slowdown in q4, in q1 in datacenter. i think it will get a little better in q2 and then, 400 gig hopefully will drive a lot of our performance in the second half of the year in that sector.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
great, thanks very much.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer

operator
good day, and welcome to the applied optoelectronics fourth quarter 2020 and full year earnings call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to lindsay savarese. please go ahead.
lindsay savarese -- investor relations
thank you. i'm lindsay savarese, investor relations for applied optoelectronics and i'm pleased to welcome you to aoi's fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results conference call. after the market closed today, aoi issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results, and provided its outlook for the first quarter of 2021. the release is also available on the company's website at ao-inc.com. this call is being recorded and webcast live. a link to the recording can be found on the investor relations section of the aoi website and will be archived for one year.
joining us on today's call is dr. thompson lin, aoi's founder, chairman and ceo; and dr. stefan murry, aoi's chief financial officer and chief strategy officer. thompson will give an overview of aoi's q4 results and stefan will provide financial detail and the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. a question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.
before we begin, i would like to remind you to review aoi's safe harbor statement. on today's call management will make forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as well as assumptions and current expectations, which could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. in some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as believe, anticipate, estimate, intend, predict, expects, plans, may, should, could, would, will or thinks, and by other similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.
forward-looking statements also include statements regarding management's beliefs and expectations related to the expansion of the reach of our products into new markets and customer responses to our innovation as well as statements regarding the company's outlook for the first quarter of 2021. except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this earnings call to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectation. more information about other risks that may impact the company's business are set forth in the risk factor section of the company's reports on file with the sec, including the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
also, with the exception of revenue, all financials discussed today are on a non-gaap basis unless specifically noted otherwise. non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap measures as well as a discussion of why we present non-gaap financial measures are included in our earnings press release that is available on our website.
before moving to the financial results, i'd like to announce that aoi management will virtually participate at the raymond james institutional investor conference on march 3rd. the presentation at this conference will be webcast live and links to the webcast will be available on the investor relations section of the aoi website. we hope to have the opportunity to interact with many of you virtually. additionally, i'd like to note that the date of our first quarter 2021 earnings call is currently scheduled for may 6, 2021.
now, i would like to turn the call over to dr. thompson lin, applied optoelectronics' founder, chairman and ceo. thompson?
thompson lin -- founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board
thank you, everyone, for joining us today to compare our 2020. i'm proud of the entire aoi team and the progress that we have made this year, despite a slow start and end to the year with changing and evolving market dynamics. we are encouraged by the double-digit revenue growth we generated in 2020, which was driven by growth in each of our three major business segments. we secure 30 total design wins last year's on par with a record 31 in 2019. given the difficulty around the pandemic last year, i'm very pleased with this design win we got. we have continued to expand the reach of our product to a diverse customer base evident by the decline in concentration, our revenue from our top 10 customers. and on this front, we are pleased to report a new greater than 10% customer during the fourth quarter in our catv segments.
turning to the fourth quarter. we delivered revenue in line with our expectation, gross margin below our expectation and non-gaap eps at a high-end of our guidance range. total revenue for the fourth quarter of $52.8 million grew 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year and as we expected was now 31.1% sequentially. as we mentioned on our q3 call, we began to see some slowing in order from some of datacenter customers in the later part of the third quarter, which extended into the fourth quarter. this slowdown was related to inventory normalization following the surge in demand that was driven by the shift to working from homes early last year.
we continue to expect generally slow commission in q1 in the datacenter segment, followed by our increased activity in this segment in q2 and beyond. non-gaap gross margin of 27.5% was below our guidance range of 28.5% to 29.5% due to many product mix and slightly higher production costs than anticipated.
as we develop our catv production during the quarter, non-gaap net loss was $0.20 per share. similar to q3, we continue to see broadband demand for our 100g product. total revenue for 100g product increased 41% from q4 of 2019. in our catv segment, the overall demand environment continue to be strong as mso, particular in north america continue to upgrade their networks. total revenue for our catv products more than doubled year-over-year and increased 37% sequentially to $15.9 million, which is the highest quarterly revenue for this segment in almost three years.
revenue from our telecom products of $3.5 million was up 59% from q4 of 2019, but was down 51% sequentially. as we mentioned on our q3 earnings call, several of our channel telecom customer notify us that their 5g deployments has been posed by several large naval operators while they revisit their supply chain following the disruption caused by uncertainties surrounding huawei's u.s. ban. we believe that this disruption will be short lived and expect to see a recovery in our telecom segment in q1. looking forward, we are excited about the growth opportunity ahead, driven by the continued need for higher bandwidth and increase capacity within the catv and datacenter markets and the increased demand for 5g products in our telecom market. we look forward to meeting again in person probably soon.
with that, i would call -- turn the call over to stefan to review the detail of our q4 performance and outlook for q1. stefan?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, we delivered revenue in line with our expectations, gross margins below our expectation, and non-gaap eps at the high end of our guidance range. while we saw strong demand in the catv market, as we anticipated, our fourth quarter results were impacted by softness in the datacenter and telecom markets. looking back on the year, despite challenging and evolving market dynamics throughout 2020, we are encouraged by the double-digit revenue growth we generated, which was driven by growth in each of our three major business segments and we are pleased with the progress we made in diversifying our revenue streams and customer base.
we secured 30 total design wins in 2020, similar to the record of 31 in 2019. of the 30 design wins, 18 were in our datacenter market, five were in our catv market, four were in our telecom market and three were in other markets. in total, for the fourth quarter we secured three new design wins among two customers, all in our catv segment. given the difficulties around the pandemic last year, i am very pleased with these design win results.
we have continued to expand the reach of our products to our diverse customer base, which is evident by the declining concentration of revenue from our top 10 customers from 2019 to 2020. and on that front, we are pleased to report that one of our catv customers exceeded 10% of our revenue for the first time.
turning to our quarterly performance. total revenue for the fourth quarter of $52.8 million was in line with our guidance range of $50 million to $55 million. revenue increased 8.5% year-over-year and decreased 31.1% sequentially.
as we mentioned on our q3 call, we began to see some slowing in orders from some of our datacenter customers in the latter part of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, related to inventory normalization following the surge in demand that was driven by the shift to working from home early last year. we expect the headwinds we are seeing in our datacenter market to persist through q1 and then begin improving in q2 and beyond.
we continue to see increased customer interest in our 400g product portfolio and expect to see revenue contribution from these products in the second half of the year. in the fourth quarter, 62% of our revenue was from our datacenter products, 30% was from catv products, with the remaining 8% from ftth, telecom and other.
our datacenter revenue came in at $32.8 million compared with $39.3 million in q4 of the prior year. in the fourth quarter, 22% of our datacenter revenue was from our 40g transceiver products and 71% was from our 100g products.
turning to our catv product segment. the overall demand environment remains strong as msos, particularly in north america continue to upgrade their networks. we generated revenue of $15.9 million, up 37% sequentially and up 136% from $6.8 million in q4 of the prior year. our catv performance in the quarter is the highest that we have seen since the third quarter of 2017. we ended the quarter with a strong backlog of catv products, which we expect to continue to drive growth in this segment going forward.
revenue from our telecom products increased to $3.5 million, up 59% from $2.2 million in q4 of the prior year, but was down 61% sequentially for reasons we discussed on our q3 call. during the fourth quarter, 5g demand in china was impacted by a pause that several of our china telecom customers were seeing as several large network operators revisited their supply chains following the disruption caused by uncertainty surrounding huawei's u.s. ban. we continue to believe that sequential growth will resume in our telecom segment in q1.
we are pleased with our progress on our customer diversification efforts. overall, for the fourth quarter, our top 10 customers represented 85.1% of revenue, down from 87.5% in q4 of the prior year. the concentration of revenue among our top 10 customers decreased from 88.1% in 2019 to 81.8% in 2020. we had three 10% or greater customers in the fourth quarter, one of which was in the datacenter market and two of which were in the catv market, including a new 10% or greater customer. these customers contributed 36%, 14% and 11% of total revenue, respectively. for the full year, we had two 10% or greater customers in the datacenter segment that contributed 38% and 12% of total revenue, respectively.
in q4, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 27.5% compared to 27.6% in q4 of the prior year. gross margin was below our guidance range of 28.5% to 29.5% due mostly to unfavorable product mix and a slightly higher production cost than anticipated as we ramped our catv production during the quarter.
total non-gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million or 39% of revenue compared with $19.4 million or 39.9% of revenue in q4 of the prior year. operating expenses as a percent of overall revenue decreased from the prior year and reflect our efficient expense management. non-gaap operating loss in the fourth quarter was $6.1 million compared to an operating loss of $6 million in q4 of the prior year. gaap net loss for q4 was $13.4 million or loss of $0.57 per basic share compared with a gaap net loss of $35.4 million or $1.76 per basic share in q4 of 2019.
on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q4 was $4.8 million or a loss of $0.20 per basic share, which was at the high end of our guidance range of a loss of $4.5 million to $5.8 million or a loss of $0.19 to $0.25 per basic share, and compares to a net loss of $3.6 million or loss of $0.18 per basic share in q4 of the prior year. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q4 were 23.6 million.
turning now to the balance sheet. we ended the fourth quarter with $50.1 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. this compares with $58.1 million at the end of the third quarter and reflects $14.1 million in cash used for operations. as of december 31, we had $110.4 million in inventory compared to $111.4 million in q3. this inventory level was higher than normal due to continuing uncertainty around covid-19 and concerns leading up to the lunar new year in china.
we made a total of $2.5 million in capital investments in the quarter, including $1.6 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.1 million on construction and building improvements. the construction on our new china facility is largely complete with all heavy construction done. total 2020 capex was approximately $12.5 million, which is considerably below our prior expectations and reflects the slowdown in our business during q4. we are still in the process of evaluating our capex plans for 2021, and we expect to share our numbers when they are available.
i would also like to provide a quick update on the at the market offering we announced in february of last year. to-date, we have raised $55 million in gross proceeds under this program, including $17 million raised in q4. as we have stated previously, we intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use.
before moving to our outlook, i would like to provide an update on our operations in texas, following the historic winter storm that occurred last week. i can report that our facilities did not suffer any meaningful damage as a result of the storm. due to process control issues related to the extremely cold temperatures and the inability to obtain regular deliveries of chemicals, including liquid nitrogen, we were unable to run operations as normal last week. in addition, many of our employees suffered damage to their homes and were therefore unavailable for work during all or parts of last week.
we expect to incur some additional costs as we work to increase production over the next few weeks to ensure that we meet our customer commitments to the extent possible. currently, we expect these costs to total between $0.5 million and $1 million and these expectations are included in our guidance.
moving now to our q1 outlook. we expect q1 revenue to be between $47 million and $51 million and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 25%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $7.3 million to $9 million and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.23 and $0.28 using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 26 million shares.
with that, i will turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question comes with -- from david kang with b. riley.
danny cheng -- b. riley -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. this is danny on for dave. i was wondering if you guys could talk about the competitive landscape in 400g that you guys are saying.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i mean, it's pretty consistent with what we've said in prior calls. overall, i don't think there's any significant change from the landscape at 100g the competitors that we saw there tend to be -- continuing to be what we expect to be the strongest competitors at 400 gig as well.
danny cheng -- b. riley -- analyst
got it. and, i guess, on the chip shortage situation, i was wondering you guys said that you don't expect it to negatively impact revenues. but, i guess, we're wondering how long you guys kind of expect that to persist?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
well, it's a little hard to say precisely. i think it's fair to say that we expect it to persist at least a couple more quarters. and you're correct that we aren't expecting it to result in reduced revenues. we expect to continue to be able to grow revenue. but we're just sort of capped in the rate at which we can grow based on component availability. it probably over the next couple of quarters. beyond that it becomes really hard to say, our suppliers are telling us that they're adding production capacity and ramping up. and if all those plans come to fruition as we expect, then i think we're probably looking at maybe two quarters. if it lasts a little longer than that, it may stretch beyond that.
we're also up against, i guess, you could say a good problem to have, i mean, the cable tv business is growing very nicely for us. we're seeing good demand picture really through the end of this year and into next year. and so, it's harder for our suppliers to catch up because they're getting hit by higher than -- higher demand than we've seen certainly in the last several years. so, it's a combination of sharply increased demand with somewhat reduced supply due to covid considerations, and the two of those things together is what's causing that shortage.
danny cheng -- b. riley -- analyst
got it. and you said into next year, so does that imply throughout 2022, you'll also see this momentum from catv?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
right now, we're pretty much booked up in catv through the end of the year. and there's no indication that that's going to slow down next year. obviously, being a few quarters out, that's still a little bit murky. but i think the msos are really at the beginning of their upgrade process, and some of them have yet to even start the upgrade process in earnest. so, i think it's reasonable to expect that that process will take several years to complete. and so, yeah, i believe that we'll see pretty strong catv performance into 2022. not just this year.
danny cheng -- b. riley -- analyst
great. thank you for the color.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes on tom diffely with d.a. davidson.
thomas diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. i wanted to get a little more color on just the datacenter recovery in the second half. i know a quarter ago you thought maybe it'd be in the second quarter. but just what are the puts and takes and what kind of gives you the confidence level?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i mean, i don't think anything's really wholesale changed in our outlook. i think the inventory -- the over inventory situation, particularly with one of our large hyperscale customers is just taking a little bit longer to resolve itself than we earlier thought. we expect it to recover at some point in q2, but it's probably a little later than we earlier anticipated. and so, for the total q2 revenue generation from -- at least from that customer, it's a little bit less than what we earlier expected. it's not a big change in what we had earlier expected.
i think what we talked about on the last call remains true today, which is that the really good growth that we expect to see is going to come from the 400 gig cycle as that starts to take hold with several of our customers. and on that front, as i mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're seeing increased interest. we had several new customers come and approach us during the quarter, looking for samples, looking to begin qualification efforts. the qualification efforts that were already ongoing in 400 gig, continue to go well, and the discussions with the customers continue to indicate to us that we can expect a successful conclusion from those efforts. and so, we're excited about 400 gig ramping in the second half of the year. the inventory situation that we talked about with -- again, with one of our large customers, that should also resolve itself late in the second quarter for a second half ramp. and then, as i mentioned, cable tv, telecom, even fiber-to-the-home in china seem to be looking very good in the second half as well.
thomas diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. great. then maybe if you're willing, a little more color on the chip shortage. are there particular types of chips or how would you characterize where the shortages is most acute, custom, off-the-shelf, whatever details you might be able to provide?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. it's all off-the-shelf stuff that we're seeing shortages on. and it's -- there's no easy way to characterize it. i would say, in general, what we're seeing shortages on or not necessarily brand new cutting edge chips. in some cases, it's actually kind of older technology that i think we're just seeing unprecedented -- maybe not unprecedented, but certainly higher demand than we've seen in the last several years. and i think it got -- some of our suppliers were caught maybe a little bit by surprise by that. and at the same time, fab capacity and other things are very, very tight as we've seen in the automotive industry and across other calls that we've listened in on just this last earnings cycle.
and it really kind of runs the gamut across multiple different chipsets and things across the industry. but i think one common trend is that, there's just a very, very tight fab capacity. so, whereas in prior times, a supplier of one of these components might have been able to drop a wafer production run into a schedule that already existed because there were some gaps in there or some slack time. now that slack is just non-existent. and so, it's taking longer for them to get new wafer starts going, and therefore, longer to ramp up that production than it had been in years past.
thomas diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. that color is very helpful. i appreciate it. and thanks for your time today.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
my pleasure.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and the next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum capital.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. this is sam on for richard. i just want to ask a little bit more on the datacenter. it sounds like your largest -- or i guess, first i want to ask if your largest datacenter customer in past quarters was a 19% customer this quarter, if that's fair to think about? and then, if that's the case, on a dollar basis, that's the lowest sales you've had there in about two years, it looks like? and curious how you would see that -- see sales from that customer trending over the course of the year as datacenter recovers.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. so that customer was not the 19% customer. and as we've talked about, one of our customers has an over inventory situation. we've talked about that in the last couple of calls. and i reiterated it in our prepared remarks and, again, on one of the earlier question, so i won't waste everybody's time going over that once again. but we do anticipate that that will be resolved here in the second quarter and portend the second half ramp.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and then on telecom, i'm curious with 5g starting to rollout more in the second half, what kind of upside you could see for that business in the second half? and could you talk about how we expect that to ramp between the second half of 2021 and then in 2022, whether there's kind of step up at some point or if it's kind of a linear ramp from your perspective? any color there would be helpful.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
well, i think -- 2021, i think we expect a stronger second half than first half. certainly, we've already started to see some incremental improvement. but we're not back to the levels where we were, let's say, middle part of last year. and so, i think there's some room to grow there. we're very excited about the progress that we've made in 5g. and also, as i mentioned in our prepared remarks, the ftth business in china also seems to be picking up. but more exciting, perhaps than that within china is the fact that we have our first design win with a 5g customer outside of china. and i know that's been a question that's come up a lot over the last several quarters on these calls is, well, ok, you guys seem to be doing well in china, but what about the rest of the world? and i think that provides some tangible evidence that we're able to be successful with customers outside of the china market as well. and that's also very exciting.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
sure. thanks for that. that's it for me.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
my pleasure.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from tim savageaux with northland capital markets.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. a couple of questions. as you look at your q2 guide and you're guiding a kind of mid- to high-single digits sequentially, given the datacenter commentary, it sounds like you expect cable tv to be the primary driver of that sequential growth, maybe a little telecom as well, or as you look across your segments, how do you see that progressing?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think that the cable tv again, i think we can see some revenue growth in there. telecom, again, it remains to be seen how much that's going to grow in the next quarter, but certainly the trends are good so far. and the datacenter, it really depends pretty sensitively on how fast -- and particularly the customer that we've seen this inventory issue with, how fast they can resolve that inventory. we believe it'll be at some point in this quarter. but whether it happens in mid-quarter or late in the quarter will kind of set the trajectory in terms of how much revenue we can actually book in this quarter. and so, that's kind of the wild card in the forecasting picture.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
got it. and just to follow-up on design wins. i think you said two datacenter or one fiber-to-the-home and one 5g, correct me if i'm wrong there.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
that's correct.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
but in the datacenter, is the customer you called out there, is that a new customer for applied opto, or perhaps a former customer?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
no, it is. it's a brand new customer that we haven't sold to before. it's a california-based, social media-focused datacenter operator.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for the breadcrumbs.

i'd now like to turn the conference over to your host today, lindsay savarese. ms. savarese, please go ahead.
lindsay savarese -- head of investor relations
thank you. i'm lindsay savarese, investor relations for applied optoelectronics and i am pleased to welcome you to aoi's first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. after the market closed today, aoi issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2021 financial results, and provided its outlook for the second quarter of 2021. the release is also available on the company's website at ao-inc.com.

now, i would like to turn the call over to dr. thompson lin, applied optoelectronics' founder, chairman and ceo. thompson?
thompson lin -- founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman
thank you, lindsay, and thank you for joining our call today. we delivered revenue and gross margin in line with our expectations, and a narrower non-gaap loss per share than we anticipated.
total revenue for the first quarter of $49.7 million, grew 22.8%, compared to the first quarter in the prior year and was down 5.8% sequentially. as we expected, we experienced generally soft q1 conditions in the datacenter segment. we expect datacenter business to increase in the second half of the year, as our customers begin 400g upgrades and inventory issues around 100g normalize.
non-gaap gross margin of 24.6% was in line with our guidance range of 23.5% to 25%, and non-gaap net loss was narrower than our previous guidance, come in at $0.21 per share.
in out catv segment, the overall demand environment was strong as msos, particularly in north america continue to upgrade their networks. total revenue for our catv products increased to more than 4 times its prior year level and was increased 17% sequentially, off a strong fourth quarter to $18.6 million. this is the highest quarterly revenue for this segment in almost three years.
by the pause [phonetic] in 5g deployments from several of our china telecom customers, as we anticipated, we started to see a nice recovery in the first quarter. as a result, revenue from our telecom products of $4.5 million was up 75% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. looking ahead, we believe china will continue to make investments in both their 5g and fiber-to-the-home infrastructure and we believe we are well positioned to sell lasers in both of these markets. we look forward to meeting again in person probably soon.
with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q1 performance and outlook for q2. stefan?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, we delivered revenue and gross margin in line with our expectations and a narrower non-gaap loss per share than we anticipated. the market dynamics we anticipated played out as expected. while we continue to see softness in the datacenter market, we are pleased with the nice recovery we saw in the telecom market and continued strength in the catv market. in total, for the first quarter, we secured four new design wins among four customers. among these four design wins, two were in our datacenter business, including one with a new customer, which is a large us-based social media-focused datacenter operator. one within our 5g business and the other design win within our ftth segment.
total revenue for the first quarter of $49.7 million, grew 22.8%, compared to the first quarter in the prior year. our q1 revenue was down 5.8% sequentially and was in line with our guidance range of $47 million to $51 million. we currently believe that the headwinds we are seeing in the datacenter market related to the inventory normalization following the shift to working from home early last year will persist through the first half of the year and then begin improving in the second half and beyond, as several of our customers begin to ramp 400g later in the year and inventory conditions in our 100g business fully normalize.
on the 400g front, we have continued to work on qualifications and delivered samples to new customers during the quarter. we have also received several new inquiries from hyperscale customers for our 400g products and we are working to deliver samples to these customers as well.
in the first quarter, 52% of our revenue was from our datacenter products, 38% was from our catv products, with the remaining 10% from ftth, telecom and other. our datacenter revenue came in at $25.9 million, compared with $33.3 million in the first quarter of the prior year. in the first quarter, 25% of our datacenter revenue was from our 40g transceiver products and 68% was from our 100g products.
turning to our catv product segment, the overall demand environment remained strong as msos, particularly in north america, continue to upgrade their networks. we generated revenue of $18.6 million, up 17% sequentially and up 341% from $4.2 million in q1 of the prior year. our catv performance represents a record for our first quarter, which is typically seasonally down and was just shy of our highest quarter in the company's history. in our catv business, we have seen some component shortages. we are working with our suppliers to improve delivery schedules for these critical components and in some cases, adding additional suppliers. we do not anticipate that these shortages will hamper our ability to continue to grow revenue, but we may continue to have a longer-than-usual backlogs for several quarters while we work to improve supply. we ended the first quarter with a strong backlog of catv products, which we expect to continue to drive growth in this segment going forward.
as we anticipated, revenue from our telecom products of $4.5 million, increased 28% sequentially and 75% from $2.6 million in q1 of the prior year. looking ahead, we believe china will continue to make investments in both their 5g and ftth infrastructure and we believe we are well positioned to sell lasers into both of these markets. also, notable during the quarter, we received our first 5g design win from a customer outside of china. we are excited to see that the success we have had with our china-based 5g customers is beginning to spread to other regions as 5g itself begins to ramp in other areas outside of china.
for the first quarter, our top 10 customers represented 90.5% of revenue, compared to 84.8% in q1 of the prior year. this increase in revenue among the top 10 customers is largely related to the strong results in catv, as several customers in this segment contributed significantly to the increased revenue this quarter. we had four 10% or greater customers in the first quarter, two of which were in the datacenter market and two of which were in our catv market. these customers contributed 19%, 16%, 16% and 14% of total revenue, respectively.
in q1, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 24.6%, which was in line with our guidance range of 23.5% to 25% and compared to 19.5% in q1 of the prior year.
total non-gaap operating expenses in the first quarter were $20.6 million, or 41.4% of revenue, compared with $19.4 million, or 48% of revenue in q1 of the prior year.
as we mentioned on the q4 call, we experienced additional costs during the first quarter due to the historic storm that hit texas in february, which totaled $0.5 million.
non-gaap operating loss in the first quarter was $8.4 million, compared to an operating loss of $11.5 million in q1 the prior year.
gaap net loss for q1 was $15.6 million, or a loss of $0.59 per basic share, compared with a gaap net loss of $16.8 million, or a loss of $0.83 per basic share in q1 of 2020.
on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q1 was $5.5 million, or a loss of $0.21 per basic share, which was narrower than our guidance range of a loss of $5.9 million to $7.3 million, or a loss in the range of $0.23 to $0.28 per basic share and compares to a net loss of $8.8 million, or a loss of $0.44 per basic share in q1 of the prior year. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q1 were 26.4 million.
now, turning to the balance sheet. we ended the first quarter with $49.3 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. this compares with $50.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter and reflects $15.2 million in cash used for operations. as of march 31, we had $106.3 million in inventory, compared to $110.4 million at the end of q4. inventory decreased due to utilization of inventory as orders, especially for telecom and catv products, increased. this inventory reduction is consistent with our long-term plan as we focus on rationalizing inventory levels.
we made a total of $2.7 million in capital investments in the quarter, including $2.3 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.3 million on construction and building improvements. the construction on our new china facility is largely complete with all heavy construction done. in total, we currently expect 2021 capex to be approximately $16 million. although as we have noted in prior years, there can be significant variability in this estimate as the year progresses.
i would also like to provide a quick update on the at-the-market offering that we announced in february of 2020. to date, we have completed this program raising the total of $55 million in gross proceeds, including $14.7 million raised in q1. as we disclosed in february, we have initiated a new at-the-market offering. to date, we have raised $0.6 million under this new program. we intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use.
moving now to our q2 outlook. we expect q2 revenue to be between $51 million and $56 million and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 25.5% to 27.5%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $3.8 million to $5.6 million and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.14 and $0.21 using weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.2 million shares.
with that, i will turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session. operator?

operator
[operator instructions] today's first question comes from simon leopold with raymond james. please proceed.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i want to start out first just, if you could clarify the catv headwind, you quantified it as $3 million headwind due to supply constraints, i guess there are a couple ways one could interpret that, but i think what i'm imagining you're suggesting is, looking at this quarter sales of roughly 27.5 million and subtracting 3 million from that. but alternatively, i could sort of think of hey, i was imagining it would be 30, but with 3 million of headwinds, it'll be 27. so, i guess i'm trying to understand the baseline or maybe a little bit finer details, the impact of that headwind, you highlighted.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, simon, thanks for bringing that up. so, i think the answer is, it's more like the ladder scenario that you had, not necessarily that those numbers are what we had in mind, but what we were saying is that, relative to what we could otherwise deliver that is based on orders and requested delivery schedules, and you know, shipping schedules and all that, we could have delivered $3 million more in our cable tv segment, but for the fact that those raw materials are constrained at this point.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
and let me just clarify that, is that 3 million hit in the june quarter or is that 3 million headwind your forecast for september?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
it's forecast for the september quarter. so, we're saying in the next quarter, in the third quarter, the one that we're in currently, we would have been able to deliver based on our current forecast, approximately $3 million more revenue than we now believe that we can do to component shortages.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
right. and i want to see if maybe you could help us understand how to think about your opportunities in the 400 gig market, and where you see, essentially, competing with zr products, because i imagine there's, you know your products are probably cheaper than the zrs, but have shorter reach. and so just trying to get a better idea of how you're thinking about sizing that market opportunity in, let's say, 2022?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure. so, first of all, i mean, we're pretty excited about the progress that we made in the 400 gig market, we highlighted the not only the two design wins that we had in the quarter, but also the fact that we have five technical qualifications, which, as we noted is as a significant milestone, i would say the technical qualification is typically the biggest hurdle to get over, in logging a design win.
the remaining hurdle would be really just receiving an order, which typically involves, you know, getting set up with proper purchasing codes and negotiating some pricing and things like that. so, those hurdles are relatively low. the technical qualification is really the key piece that i think typically takes the longest. so, we're pretty excited about the progress that we had with those two design wins and the five technical qualifications.
with respect to your question about, you know, kind of where we fit in, in the ecosystem, i think, as you mentioned, our products are positioned to be a lower cost version of 400 gig that can be used primarily in intra data center applications. so, you know, it distances up to a couple of kilometers, as opposed to longer distances in that, which is where zr is typically targeted.
now, zr, of course, will work at shorter distances, but at a higher price, as you noted. and as far as you know, the market sizing for next year, you know, i can point you to some third party estimates and things like that, for the overall market size, i think what we're hearing from our particular customer base is that they're going to, you know, begin implementing 400 gig later in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.
my anticipation is that that'll be a relatively slow, incremental ramp throughout that time, because that's typically how it goes with these customers, when they try to implement a new technology like 400 gig. they don't instantly, you know, start to implement that technology, they put it in incrementally, test it, make sure everything's working as expected, and then begin to ramp up after that.
so, this kind of two phase ramp is what i would expect there. and the second phase, which would probably be a stronger ramp is probably sometime in the middle part of next year.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
right. and then just maybe a quick one, if i might is, we've seen awards coming out of china for 5g technology, there was the 700 megahertz award a few weeks ago, and then more recently, china unicom and telecom made tenders for ran, just wondering how we can maybe look at those events in terms of helping, give us some sense of when your china business related to the 5g backhaul, front haul should improve?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, that's a great question, simon. i mean, the 5g market is a little bit hard to make out right now. as we noted in our earlier remarks, some of our customers in china have begun ordering more products from us, which implies that their inventory levels are down to, you know, whatever level they think is comfortable, and they're placing new orders. other customers haven't yet started to place those new orders yet.
so, i think we're, i my, the way i'm interpreting that is that we're in a period where new orders are starting to flow from or either new orders are starting to flow from the carriers like china telecom and china unicom or that there's line of sight to those new orders and some of our vendors are getting ready while other vendors probably still have some buffer inventory that they want to draw down before they start to place new orders.
so, it feels like that should start to turn with more of our customers in this quarter or certainly by the fourth quarter, and the data points that you gave around the new bandwidth awards and new product orders coming out of china telecom and china unicom, i think those are significant data points that point also in that direction of a gradual recovery in the next quarter or two.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
my pleasure.
operator
the next question comes from alex henderson with needham.
alex henderson -- needham -- analyst
thanks. stefan, can you give us a little bit of a granularity around, you know, what's your thoughts are between the data center and catv and the guide for 3q? what are we assuming there? is the spike up in 2q an abnormal spike, and it's going to stabilize or decline sequentially back to a more normalized growth or revenue level or is that a new base that will be growing the catv? and, you know, clearly, it's nice getting 400 gig wins, but the data center business declining sequentially into what is normally a seasonally strong quarter, is that now a trend line where it's you should expect the 40 gig to roll over a little bit faster, going forward as people don't want, you know, 40 good products in their you know, to put new into their networks or a little out there?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure. so, i'll take your first question first, which is, you know, what's the trajectory for cable tv? as i noted in our prepared remarks, our cable tv revenue is limited over the next quarter or perhaps beyond by component availability. and we talked about the magnitude of that in the third quarter being about $3 million. so, you can get a pretty good picture that, you know, at least in q3, and i would say that, you know, after that, in subsequent quarters after that, depending on component availability, we should be at about that level as well.
so, i think we're kind of at a new, a new level in cable tv, and there's opportunities to grow from there, particularly as we overcome some of these supply constraints, which is currently the limiting factor to deliver revenue there. at the same time, then your second question is about, you know, the trajectory in datacom, and i do think q2 probably represents the low point in datacom revenue for us, at least the local minimum. that is, i think we'll see some incremental improvement in data calm.
and as we noted in our prepared remarks, that's going to be driven by two factors. one is the 400g design wins and our beginning that first phase ramp that i spoke with simon about earlier in the 400g business. and at the same time, i also expect to see some recovery in our 100g business, as some of the customers that had previously purchased inventory are finally getting that inventory back down to a level that they think is appropriate to begin placing new orders. so, those two factors, i think, can drive some incremental growth in the data center business.
alex henderson -- needham -- analyst
so, it sounds like data center up modestly a couple of million dollars, you're talking about the other ones probably telecom, that sounds like it's up a little bit sequentially off of a fairly low base. so, that would suggest that you do expect a little bit of a retrenchment in the catv to get to your guide, i would assume?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yes, that's correct. and we highlighted that that's largely due to component shortages.
alex henderson -- needham -- analyst
okay. i get it. that's perfect. i wanted to go back to the inventory, your inventory carry rate is very high relative to, you know, to your revenue base, and relative to industry standards. and i get it that in this environment, that's probably not a bad thing, but do we have any concerns about having potentially any issues of having too much of, say, older product, or lower speed products that might not be applicable to the future demand picture? do you have the right inventory in that mix?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i think we do. you know, if you remember, in some prior quarters, we've talked a lot about the fact that our 400g platform and our 100g platform and our 40g platform share a lot of commonality in terms of the design and the parts. and so, you know, to that extent, there's inventory of raw materials and things that may have been applicable to even 40g products that we could still continue to use in 100g and certainly, you know, cable tv, well, some of the older generation products, maybe slower selling than the current stuff. there's still a lot of demand even for older generation products.
so, we feel pretty good about the inventory that we have. i should say, we feel good about the quality of the inventory that we have. now, your point about inventory level being high is well taken. we did bulk-up on inventory quite a bit in the, actually even prior to covid in the chinese new year period going back last spring. and, you know, i think that that probably, you know, we probably got a little bit out of ahead of our skus in terms of the amount of inventory that we have.
to your point, it's comforting to have that inventory around with all the uncertainties that we've endured in the last year. but we do want to continue to draw that inventory level down. we've made some significant progress in that regard. i mean, we've pulled our inventory, i think it maxed out at around $113 million, and we're down to just about $100 million at the end of the quarter. so, i mean, that's good progress. i want to continue to make progress on that regard. and bring that inventory level down to a number that i think would be, you know, more appropriate for the business, which is probably in the $80 million vicinity.
alex henderson -- needham -- analyst
one technical question, you said the 0.9 million of mark to market at the market issued, was that shares or was that revenue? you know the cash in.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
that's dollars. that's the amount of net proceeds for.
alex henderson -- needham -- analyst
for the dollar? okay. thanks.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
all right, alex. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from sam peterman with craig-hallum.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hi, guys. sam on for richard here. couple questions. i think i'll start with data center. i know you guys have talked about, you know, inventory burns ending in the second quarter and starting to recover from there, which looks like it's going to happen, but, you know, even given that data centers down looks like a little bit more than expected. i mean, was there, kind of worse inventory burns than expected, or something else in data center that can kind of explain the weakness there this quarter?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
well, i don't think that the weaknesses is, kind of a long-term thing. it has to do with just the confluence of order patterns across a couple of different customers. and, you know, as we, as we discussed, i think that probably represents a local minimum in terms of, you know, data center revenue. and i think, you know, the catalyst going forward is again, you know, inventory normalization with our 100g customers, especially one of our large 100g customers, as well as some headwinds, or excuse me, some tailwinds from the 400 gig, as that starts to ramp.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, fair enough. second question on 400 gig, i'm curious what those five technical qualifications that you talked about, are those with new customers or existing customers, or can you break that down?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
all of the 400 gig technical qualifications are with existing customers.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then last one for me on cable tv. i know, i think last call you talked about having, you know, visibility in the order book out through the end of the year. i know, you know, supply constraints are going to cap that a bit, but can you talk about where you sit in terms of visibility today? and if that order books is extending out in the next year at all, and yeah any color there would be helpful?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yes, the order book is extending out in the next year. the component availability situation, i mean, i was listening in on commscope's call, and they're saying similar things about component availability. so, i think it's, kind of an industry wide trend. so, we're not seeing customers, sort of pulling back on orders and shifting order patterns. i think it's quite the contrary, what we're experiencing is that customers are, you know, working with us to try to pull in inventory as quickly as they can, rather than, you know, trying to move orders to somebody else or something.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. that's all for me.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from dave kang with b. riley.
dave kang -- b. riley -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. my first question is on gross margin. revenue is going to be, kind of flattish sequentially in third quarter and yet you're expecting gross margin to decline by five points sequentially, can you just go over some of the factors?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure, there's two factors. one is, some product mix within our cable tv segment, just you know, different customers, sort of waxing and waning in terms of what they're buying. and then the other factor is, is related to the component shortages that we're experiencing. and so we are experiencing increased costs as we try to pull in those components. so, we're paying, for example, expedite fees to suppliers, we're in some cases, qualifying new suppliers that may even be higher cost suppliers just because they have availability, things like that, that are also negatively impacting our gross margin in the quarter.
so, we discussed that we think that the cable tv mix is probably a one quarter thing. i think it'll shift more back toward, you know, more favorable product mix in the fourth quarter. the component availability is a little bit unclear how long that is going to last. i think it'll certainly last through the third quarter. it may last into the fourth quarter, but it's not totally clear exactly how fast we're going to be able to recover from that.
it's a very fluid situation. some of those component availability situations are caused by for example, covid shutdowns in certain parts of the world where suppliers have factories and things, and those how those things play out, in terms of timing is a little bit difficult to project at this point. but i think it's fair to say it, it should persist through the third quarter and hopefully, we'll find ways around it in the fourth quarter, but it's not totally clear at this point.
dave kang -- b. riley -- analyst
regarding component shortages, is it just mainly in cable tv, i mean, you're not experiencing a similar situation in the data center market?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, and i think a lot of that has to do with the inventory that we talked about earlier. i mean, alex had a very good point that our inventory levels are rather elevated. and that's the point that we've made also on our last few calls. you know that's a double-edged sword, of course, we're tying up cash.
and there's always some risk of obsolescence, although, as i mentioned, in response to alex's question, i don't think that's a major concern for us at this point. but, the bright side to that is that, you know, if you do have inventory, then you're not as likely to suffer from supply shortages.
so, in the data center business where we have, you know, a longer history and a more, you know, a better track record in terms of order patterns, we were able to bulk up on those products ahead of chinese new year last year, and that inventory is continuing to help us out when it comes to component shortages in the present time.
the cable tv, part of our business, as you can appreciate, was significantly smaller a year ago, and we didn't have the same bulk of inventory going into, you know, going from pre-covid times into, you know, the first or second quarter of last year. and therefore, you know, we don't have that same cushion of inventory there. and that's where we're, sort of scrambling to try to find the inventory that we need to continue to grow the revenue in that segment.
dave kang -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. and my last question is on 400 gig. i'm trying to, kind of gauge what kind of trajectory we should be expecting. first of all, just wanted to clarify, do you say did you say 400 gig will ramp end of third quarter or fourth quarter? and then, you know, like, can you just talk about your expectations? maybe when does it become -- 20% of revenues?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
so, i think i said that the 400 gig will start to ramp at the end of the third quarter, which means it's probably not going to be a big amount of revenue in the third quarter, but it should start to, you know, start to become, you know, more meaningful in the fourth quarter. i did also highlight in answer to, i believe it was simon's question earlier that we typically see in these scenarios, a sort of two phase ramp, right.
so, there's an initial phase of ramp, where we go from zero to some relatively small number that's associated with initial orders from customers who are trying out, you know, putting these products into their actual live networks and making sure that they perform as well in that environment as they did in all the lab testing that they've been doing in the qualification phase. they tend to be, you know, appropriately circumspect when it comes to ordering in that first phase. and then once they become more comfortable that everything's working correctly, then there's the second phase where the ramp becomes more substantial and we expect that phase will probably be sometime in the middle part of next year.
dave kang -- b. riley -- analyst
and if i can just squeeze in one more regarding 400 gig, how should we think about margins between 100 gig versus 400 gig?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
broadly similar, there can be variations in gross margin among that product family either the 100 gig or 400 gig based on the particular, you know, the particular customers and the particular types of transceivers that are being ordered. but overall, i would expect the margins to be, you know, broadly similar between 100 gig and 400 gig.
dave kang -- b. riley -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from tim savageaux with northland capital markets.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
good afternoon. not a lot left here, but maybe i'll follow up on 400 gig timing and maybe, kind of the magnitude of the opportunity, it seems that the one area where discussion of 400 zr would be relevant for you guys would be at microsoft, where they've stated pretty plainly that they need to get that dci rollout going before they can upgrade inside the data center.
and i'm not saying that's one of your design wins, but if you could add some color on that. but with a scenario like that, you know, explain a, why design wins are coming, you know, kind of maybe a little late in the game; and b, you know, kind of support the kind of small ramp and then bigger ramp in mid-year type scenario that you're discussing?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah, i mean, i think you're right, in the sense that for all of our customers, and microsoft certainly has historically been one of if not our largest data center customer. it has been recently it has been our largest data center customer. and so, you know, anything that would affect the timing and magnitude of the rollout of microsoft's 400g efforts, you know, would certainly be of interest to us and could be a partial explanation for some of the ramp rates that we have talked about earlier.
that's not to say, you know, certainly not all the design plans are technical qualifications that we had or even necessarily any of them with microsoft, but we have multiple customers that are involved in that, but certainly, we're watching the situation with microsoft, and in any of the factors that affect their rollout would likely be affecting us as well.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
got it. and, you know, in terms of the magnitude of that opportunity, you know, should things go reasonably well for you in 400 gig? i mean, can you imagine a scenario sometime next year where your 400 gig business is, you know, approaching the size of your current overall data center business on a quarterly basis?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i could imagine that scenario. i think, as you pointed out, a lot of things have to go right. i would expect that 400 gig can approach, you know, say 10% of revenue at some point next year, which would put it at, you know, roughly the level of our current data center business. so, i think that that's, you know, achievable. clearly, we're a little ways out from seeing that actually happened and having a tremendous amount of confidence in that, but i think it's certainly possible.
tim savageaux -- northland capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks very much, and congrats on the design wins.

now, i would like to turn the call over to dr. thompson lin, applied optoelectronics founder, chairman, and ceo. thompson?
thompson lin -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, lindsay. thank you for joining us today. we delivered revenue and non-gaap eps in line with our expectations. however, our gross margin came in slightly below our expectations mostly due to our unfavorable product mix in our catv segment at increased cost from the component shortage we experienced in the quarter.total revenue for the second quarter of $54.2 million decreased 16.9%, compared to a strong second quarter in the prior year, but was up 9% sequentially. the strong sequential growth was led by our catv segment, which this quarter decreased our data center business, accounting for 51% of total revenue to our catv demand environment remained strong as mso particularly in north america continued to upgrade their network.
total revenue for our catv products increased more than four-fold year-over-year in q2, an increase 48.1% sequentially of a strong fourth quarter to a record $27.6 million. as we expected, we experienced generally soft q2 conditions in the data center segments. as a result, total revenue for our data center products of $22.4 million decreased 57.4% year-over-year and 13.7% sequentially.we are pleased to report that with q2 new design wins with two customers for our 400g products during q2. in addition to the design wins, we had five technical qualification of our 400g products, which stefan will discuss in more detail. we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our 400g products as our customers start to degrade.
we expect the order will continue as our customers start to realize the benefit or performance of our 400g solution. based on this, we continue to expect our data center business to begin to increase in the second half of the year as our customer begin 400g upgrades and inventory issue around 100g normalize.turning to our telecom segment, while we do see early sign of a recovery in q1 we saw mixed condition in q2, with some customer present new order, while others continue to use existing inventory. overall, with the market condition in the china telecom markets is continuing to repeat as the timing and cadence of the 5g rollout there remain somewhat opaque. as a result, revenue from our telecom products of $3.3 million was down 46% year-over-year and 25.6% sequentially.
looking ahead, we believe china will continue to make investment in both their 5g and fiber-to-the-home infrastructure and we expect higher revenue in the segment in the second half of this year, compared to first half.with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q2 performance and outlook for q3. stefan?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, we delivered revenue and non-gaap eps in-line with our expectations. however, our gross margin came in below our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix in our catv segment, and increased costs associated with the component shortages we saw during the quarter.while we continued to see softness in the data center market, and conditions in the china 5g market remained somewhat soft, we are pleased with the continued strength and record results we are seeing in the catv market. and looking ahead, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our 400g products, which we believe will drive growth in our data center business as order volumes ramp later in the year.
notably, we are pleased to report that we secured two design wins for our 400g products during q2. in total for the second quarter, we secured three new design wins among three customers, all of which are existing aoi customers. all three of the design winds were in our data center business, and two of the three were for 400g, which i'll discuss in more detail shortly.total revenue of $54.2 million decreased 16.9%, compared to a strong second quarter in the prior year, and was up 9% sequentially. our q2 revenue was in-line with our guidance range of $51 million to $56 million. as we expected, the headwinds we saw in q1 continued into the second quarter in the data center market related to the inventory normalization that followed the shift to working from home early last year.
we believe these headwinds will begin to subside in the second half of the year, driven by several of our customers who will begin to ramp 400g deployments. additionally, we believe that inventory conditions in our 100g business will begin to normalize later in the year.on the 400g front, as thompson and i mentioned, we secured two new design wins with two customers for our 400g products during q2. one of the design wins was with a data center equipment manufacturer, and the other was with the hyperscale data center operator, both are u.s. based companies and both our existing aoi customers.
as a reminder, for aoi, a design win occurs when we have successfully completed both the technical qualification of the product, as well as received an initial order from the customer.in addition to these two design wins, we also have successfully completed technical qualifications on five other 400g opportunities.we are optimistic that many of these qualifications will become design wins in the near future once we receive orders for these products from our customers. the technical qualifications are with two different data center operators and the data center equipment oem. all are u.s. based companies. we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing and expect that 400g will begin its ramp with us later in q3.
in the second quarter, 51% of our revenue was from catv products. 41% was from our data center products, with the remaining 8% from ftth, telecom, and other. in our catv product segment, the overall demand environment remains very strong, as msos, particularly in north america continue to upgrade their networks.we generated revenue of $27.6 million in q2, up 48.1% sequentially, and up 349% from $6.1 million in q2 of the prior year. we are still seeing component shortages in our catv business and we continue to work with our suppliers to improve delivery schedules for these critical components, and in some cases, adding additional suppliers.
we anticipate that these shortages will adversely affect our third quarter revenue by about $3 million. as we work to improve our supply chain, we may continue to have a longer than usual backlog for several quarters. our q2 data center revenue came in at $22.4 million, compared with $52.5 million in the second quarter of the prior year. in the second quarter, 33% of our data center revenue was from our 40g transceiver products, and 59% was from our 100g products.turning to our telecom segment, revenue from our telecom products of $3.3 million decreased 25.6% sequentially, primarily driven by continued slow demand in china for 5g upgrades there, and 46% from $6.2 million in q2 of the prior year. looking ahead, we continue to believe china will increase investments in both their 5g and ftth infrastructure. and we believe we are well-positioned to sell lasers into both of these markets.
for the second quarter, our top 10 customers represented 86.8% of revenue, consistent with the 86.9% in q2 of the prior year. we had four 10% or greater customers in the second quarter, two of which were in the data center market, and two of which were in the catv market. these customers contributed 24.1%, 21.3%, 11.2%, and 10.9% of total revenue respectively.in q2, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 25%, which was below our guidance range of 25.5% to 27.5% for the reasons i mentioned previously, and compared favorably to 23.1% in q2 of the prior year. we expect the downward pressure on gross margin due to unfavorable product mix in our catv segment to persist through q3 before starting to recover to a more normal mix in q4.
we are currently uncertain when the increased costs due to supply chain disruptions will subside, but we also see them persisting through q3, which will also negatively affect gross margin. total non-gaap operating expenses in the second quarter were $20 million or 36.9% of revenue, compared with $20.6 million or 31.6% of revenue in q2 of the prior year. non-gaap operating loss in the second quarter was $6.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.6 million in q2 of the prior year.gaap net loss for q2 was $8.2 million or a loss of $0.31 per basic share, compared with a gaap net loss of $18.6 million or a loss of $0.89 per basic share in q2 of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q2 was $4.1 million or loss of $0.15 per basic share, which was in line with our guidance range of a loss of $3.8 million to $5.6 million, or a loss in the range of $0.14 to $0.21 per basic share, and compares to a net loss of $5 million or a loss of $0.24 per basic share in q2 of the prior here. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q2 were 26.9 million.
turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $50.5 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. this compares with $49.3 million at the end of the first quarter, and reflects $5.9 million in cash used for operations. as of june 30, we had $100.4 million in inventory, compared to $106.3 million at the end of q1. inventory decreased primarily due to utilization of inventory for customer orders. this inventory reduction is consistent with our long-term plan, as we focus on rationalizing inventory levels.we made a total of $3.2 million in capital investments in the second quarter, including $2.9 million in production equipment and machinery and an immaterial amount on construction and building improvements. we continue to expect 2021 capex will be approximately $16 million. although as we have noted in prior years, there can be significant variability in this estimate as the year progresses.
as we disclosed in february of this year, we initiated a new at the market offering. to date we have raised $0.9 million under this new program. we intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use.moving now to our q3 outlook, we expect q3 revenue to be between $51 million and $56 million, and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 19.5% to 21.5%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $6.9 million to $9 million and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.25 and $0.33, using a weighted average basic share account of approximately 27.7 million shares.
with that, i'll turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session. operator?

[operator instructions] and the first question comes from simon leopold with raymond james.
mauricio alberto munoz roldan -- raymond james & associates, inc -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. this is mauricio for simon today. stefan, can you please give us an update on your traction with your 400-gig opportunity? i think you previously disclosed expectations for 400-gig to ramp on the third quarter and become more meaningful in the fourth quarter. maybe you can elaborate on the 400-gig traction this quarter? and how should we think about the opportunity going forward?
dr. stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yes. so as we noted in our prepared remarks, what we've seen is that there -- at least one of our customers, one of the early customers that qualified our 400g products has -- seems to be seeing some component shortages in other parts of the 400g network. that is, it's not optical products, it's not aoi's inability to supply those products, but they're seeing shortages of some other component that's making it difficult for them to ramp their 400g efforts as quickly as they would like. so as we noted in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect to see growth overall in the data center market, but the 400g rollout, maybe a little bit later depending how long the supply disruption that they're seeing lasts.

now i would like to turn the call over to dr. thompson lin, applied optoelectronics founder, chairman and ceo. thompson?
dr. thompson lin -- founder, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board
thank you, lindsay. thank you for joining our call today. the third quarter played out largely as we expected. we delivered in-line revenue and gross margin and a narrower non-gaap net loss relative to our expectations. during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in the catv market and improving condition in the data center and telecom markets. however, as we anticipated, our revenue in the third quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $3 million as a result of the well-known global component shortage, and our q3 gross margin came in at the low end of our expectations mostly due to the unfavorable product mix in our catv segment and increased costs from component shortage.
we achieved total revenue for the third quarter of $53.3 million, which decreased 30.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and was down 1.7% sequentially. total revenue in our catv segment of $23.1 million was up 98.4% year-over-year but was down from a record $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. the overall catv demand environment remains strong, and we continue to see good new customer traction with a number of our products. total revenue for our data center product of $23.9 million decreased 56.8% year-over-year and increased 6.9% sequentially. during the third quarter, we secured nine design wins among seven customers. one of design wins in the quarter was a new 400g transceiver design win with an existing customer that is a network equipment manufacturer supplying enterprise and hyperscale data center customers.
in addition, two of design wins are related to 25g pon and are with a large multinational network equipment manufacturer focused on the telecom market. now turning to our telecom segment. revenue came in at $5.1 million, down 42% year-over-year and up 54.5% sequentially. while we are pleased to deliver sequential growth in this segment, during the third quarter, we see continued volatility in the market condition in the china telecom market as the timing and cadence of the 5g rollout there remains somewhat opaque. looking ahead, we do expect quarter-to-quarter variability until the pace of 5g rollout in china becomes more predictable.
with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q3 performance and outlook for q4. stefan?
dr. stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, the third quarter played out largely as we expected, and we delivered revenue and gross margin in line with our expectations and a narrower non-gaap net loss relative to our expectations due to slightly lower-than-expected operating expenses. during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in the catv market and improving conditions in the data center and telecom markets. however, as we anticipated, our results were adversely impacted by approximately $3 million due to the well-known component shortages and supply chain disruptions, and our q3 gross margin came in at the low end of our expectations mostly due to unfavorable product mix in our catv segment and increased costs from component shortages.
while we were able to mitigate some of these anticipated impacts, we saw additional component shortages later in the quarter due to the shutdown in vietnam. as we work to improve our supply chain, we may continue to have longer-than-usual backlog for several quarters. looking ahead, we expect that the component shortages could adversely affect our fourth quarter by approximately $2 million to $3 million. we also expect increased costs associated with the shortages to persist through q4. turning to our quarterly performance.
we secured nine new design wins among seven customers. of the nine design wins, four were with data center customers, two were with telecom customers, two were with ftth customers, and one was with a catv customer. as thompson mentioned, one of these design wins was a new 400g transceiver design win with a network equipment manufacturer supplying enterprise and hyperscale data center customers. in addition, two of the design wins are related to 25g pon and are with a large multinational network equipment manufacturer focused on the telecom market. all of the design wins in q3 were with existing customers of aoi, so these design wins represent deeper penetration within our existing customer base. total third quarter revenue of $53.3 million decreased 30.5% compared to the third quarter in the prior year and was down 1.7% sequentially.
our q3 revenue was in line with our guidance range of $51 million to $56 million. in the third quarter, 45% of our revenue was from our data center products, 43% from catv products, with the remaining 12% from ftth, telecom and other. in our catv product segment, the overall demand environment remains very strong as msos, particularly in north america, continue to upgrade their networks. we generated revenue of $23.1 million in q3, up 98.4% from $11.6 million in q3 of the prior year and down 16.3% sequentially from record results in q2 '21 due largely to the component shortages and reduced sales of certain node transmitter products as inventory rebuilding for these products has largely been completed by one of our customers. notably, in early october, we virtually attended the society for cable telecommunications engineers or scte expo.
commentary from customers continues to be positive. looking ahead, we have good visibility with catv orders well into next year, and we continue to believe that our technologies will play a key part in msos' upgrade plans over the next several quarters. notably, in the quarter, we began to see an increase in orders associated with so-called high-split upgrades, which several msos are using to increase catv network bandwidth. our amplifier products and certain of our node products are used in these high-split networks, and we are seeing particular order strength in this area. our q3 data center revenue came in at $23.9 million compared to $55.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year.
in the third quarter, 36% of our data center revenue was from our 40g transceiver products and 57% was from our 100g products. our data center revenue was up 6.9% sequentially. we remain optimistic about our ability to see sequential growth in the data center in the second half of this year. however, we are seeing some supply constraints that are beginning to impact other parts of the 400g ecosystem, which may in turn impact the timing of the 400g rollout. and this may limit the extent of the sequential growth we can see in the back half of this year. now turning to our telecom segment. revenue from our telecom products of $5.1 million increased 54.5% sequentially and declined 42% from $8.9 million in q3 of the prior year. while we are pleased to deliver sequential growth in this segment during the third quarter, we see market conditions in the china telecom market as continuing to be lumpy as the timing and cadence of the 5g rollout there remains somewhat opaque.
looking ahead, we do expect quarter-to-quarter variability until the pace of 5g rollouts in china becomes more predictable. also, we are excited about the design wins in 25g pon that i mentioned earlier as over time, this will provide an additional growth driver to our ftth revenue. for the third quarter, our top 10 customers represented 86% of revenue, up from 84.9% in q3 of the prior year. we had two 10% or greater customers in the third quarter, one in the catv market and one in the data center market. these customers contributed 29.4% and 15.5% of total revenue, respectively. in q3, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 19.9%, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 19.5% to 21.5% and was down from 25% in q2 of 2021 and 27.4% in q3 of 2020. total non-gaap operating expenses in the third quarter were $19.3 million or 36.3% of revenue compared with $22.3 million or 29.1% of revenue in q3 of the prior year.
the reduction in operating expenses is due to a decrease in r&d spend as some of the costs associated with our 400g development have begun to subside along with decreased shipping expenses due to lower shipments to one of our customers. non-gaap operating loss in the third quarter was $8.7 million compared to an operating loss of $1.3 million in q3 in the prior year. gaap net loss for q3 was $15.8 million or a loss of $0.58 per basic share compared with a gaap net loss of $9.6 million or a loss of $0.42 per basic share in q3 of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q3 was $5.3 million or a loss of $0.20 per basic share, which was better than our guidance range of a loss of $6.9 million to $9 million or a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.33 per basic share due to lower operating expenses than forecast and compares to a net loss of $1.4 million or a loss of $0.06 per basic share in q3 of the prior year.
the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q3 were 27.1 million. turning now to the balance sheet. we ended the third quarter with $48.9 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. this compares with $50.5 million at the end of the second quarter. as of september 30, we had $94.5 million in inventory compared to $100.4 million at the end of q2. inventory decreased primarily due to utilization of inventory for customer orders. this inventory reduction is consistent with our long-term plan as we focus on rationalizing inventory levels. we made a total of $3.8 million in capital investments in the third quarter, including $3.4 million in production equipment and machinery and an immaterial amount on construction and building improvements.
we now expect 2021 capex will be approximately $15 million. as we disclosed in february of this year, we initiated a new at-the-market offering. to date, we have raised $1 million under this new program, including $0.1 million raised in q3. we intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use. moving now to our q4 outlook. we expect q4 revenue to be between $51 million and $55 million and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 18.5% to 20%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.6 million and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.20 and $0.24, using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.4 million shares.
with that, i will turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question today will come from sam peterman with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask on gross margins. obviously, with -- it seems like some of the mix issues and cable resolving by the middle of the year that the margin outlook for the back half would be better.
do you guys think you can get into kind of the mid-20s there or what kind of as the cable issue resolves in data center, you start to ramp 400-gig, is mid-20s kind of reasonable for where you guys think you can go? or how do you think about margins in the second half?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think, mid-20s is an achievable number for us. it's difficult to put a precise time line on that. i mean, there's a lot of moving parts as we mentioned, some of the component shortages and other things that have been affecting us.
it's a little bit difficult to provide an exact time frame for that, but it's certainly a number that we think is achievable.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. fair enough. on data center, it sounds like that these two customers in 400-gig ramping in the second half that will provide an uplift from where you are today? should you -- how should we think about data center revenues in the first half? and then, how should we think about what 400-gig can add? is that in the low millions or even potentially more than that in the second half?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
well, i think, data center revenues probably will be reasonably consistent throughout the first half of the year with where they were in the last quarter. and then, as you mentioned, we'll start to see around. now some of that -- there will be a little bit of a shift there, as we mentioned, in our prepared remarks from sort of the 100g to starting to see a little bit more of an increase in the 400g revenue. it's probably not going to be hugely meaningful certainly in the first half until we start to see a ramp later on in the year, hopefully.
but within that as that mix is shifting, we don't think the overall number is going to change that much in the first quarter or two or a year.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then, on the 400-gig customers, you kind of described one of them. is there any way you could characterize the other one? and then, is there any way -- are you -- on the second point of your customer, are you also the primary or lead supplier there? and how would you size that one of that opportunity relative to that first 400-gig win?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i would say that the size of both the customers is probably, i mean, roughly similar, i don't have the total purchasing trend for each of them. i don't have a number on the customer that we didn't talk about as much. i don't have information from them about whether we're the primary or secondary source on that. some customers will tell you that information directly, others will not.
so from that perspective, i can't give you that information. but certainly, we believe that all of the customers will have multiple sources and which are in the top one or two, you're probably going to get a pretty reasonable market share, and that's what we would expect with both of these customers.
sam peterman -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. fair enough. that's it from me. thanks, guys.
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
ok.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question will come from robert mander with cowen. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
this is bob mander for paul silverstein. guys, at one time, you were thinking that 400g could be 10% of revenue this year. is that still in the work -- still what you would see?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i wouldn't say -- i don't think not. we haven't changed our outlook much on the 400g. i think, it's really positive that we're starting to see actual orders or volume orders flowing from a couple of customers now. we still have a number of qualification efforts that are underway, but we're optimistic we'll culminate here in the next few months.
and that -- all of those opportunities together should drive revenue, whether that will be 10% by the end of the year or not, it's difficult to say, but i think it's possible.
unknown speaker
ok. in the past, i guess, last quarter, one of your principal customers for 400g was seeing their own supply chain constraints, which was limiting their ability to place orders. did i hear correctly that that's been resolved?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
that was more related to just the overall inventory situation. as you recall, if you go back a few quarters, we had -- that particular customer had been hit with supply chain issues that affected their overall deployment of not only 400g but also 100g technology at the time. so it wasn't a statement specifically at 400g, it was just their overall demand to be coming back.
unknown speaker
ok. but that's been -- is that still an issue with them, or has that been addressed?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i think, it's largely been addressed at this point.
unknown speaker
ok, ok. and at the moment, your data center and catv is pretty evenly split. and it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about going forward to catv. do you still see an even split? or are you going to expect to see catv be a larger, a greater percentage than data center going forward for the year?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i think, they'll be fairly comparable for the year. as you recall from past experience, our first quarter in cable tv can be a little bit challenging for us just because we have the lunar new year shutdown, which affects most of our cable tv products are made in asia. so by virtue of the fact that there's just less time in q1 due to the lunar new year that oftentimes puts a damper on our ability to expand cable tv. so we may see cable tv not grow as much early in the year as it will in the back half of the year.
and so, from quarter to quarter, you might see some variability. but if you look at the year as a whole, i think the two will probably be fairly comfortable.
unknown speaker
ok. all right. well, thank you for taking my questions.

now i'd like to turn the call over to dr. thompson lin, applied optoelectronics' founder, chairman and ceo. thompson? 
thompson lin -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, cassidy, and thank you for joining our call today. turning to the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue and non-gaap eps in line with our expectations and gross margin below our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix and increased costs from unanticipated supply chain and logistic expenses. during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in the catv market and improving conditions in the data center market. we achieved total revenue for fourth quarter of $54.4 million, which increased 3.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 2.1% sequentially.
total revenue in our catv segment of $24.9 million was up 56.4% year over year and up 7.9%, sequentially. the overall catv demand environment remains strong, and we currently have an unprecedented order backlog extended into q4 of this year. we believe the condition in our catv market are likely to remain highly unfavorable into 2023 because our products are currently being used in network upgrade project by the three largest catv mso in the u.s., along with other smaller operators. for the revenue for our data center product of $25.2 million decreased 23.1% year over year and increased 5.3% sequentially.
the sequential growth is encouraged as inventory level with our largest data center customer appear to have returned to normal level and delivery against new demand from this customer has resumed. in addition to our largest data center customer, we saw a significant order increase from several of our new data center customers. some of these increases were offset and anticipated decline in 40g revenue indicating that the mix continue to shift to 100g. in addition, i'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we received our first volume orders for 400g products from two different data center customers.
this represents the accumulation of a multi-year qualification effort with these customers, and we believe this initial order will lead to further significant order in the future as 400g gradually surpasses 100g as a dominant data rate within large data centers. during the fourth quarter, we secured four design wins among four customers. two of these design wins were with data center customers and two were with telecom customers. one of the data center wins was with an existing data center customer for our 400g products.
this customer is currently purchasing 100g product from aoi and expressed an initial volume order for its early 400g deployments. with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q4 performance and outlook for q1. stefan?

thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, we delivered revenue and non-gaap eps in line with our expectations and gross margin below our expectations, mostly due to unfavorable product mix and unanticipated supply chain and logistics costs. during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand in the catv market and improving conditions in the data center market. as we anticipated, our results were adversely impacted by approximately $3 million due to the well-known component shortages and supply chain disruptions.
currently, we believe that supply constraints are easing and do not anticipate revenue shortfall in the first quarter due to an inability to source necessary raw materials. we do believe, however, that pricing and shipping costs on many of these components will remain elevated for some time, and this will negatively impact margins in the quarter. turning to our quarterly performance. we secured four new design wins among four customers.
of the four design wins, two were with data center customers and two were with telecom customers. one of the data center design wins was our first for 400g products and was with an existing data center customer. this customer is currently purchasing 100g products from aoi and has placed an initial volume order for its earliest 400g deployments. we are pleased to report that this customer has chosen aoi as the primary supplier for its 400g data center transceiver needs.
total fourth quarter revenue of $54.4 million, increased 3.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 2.1% sequentially. our q4 revenue was at the upper end of our guidance range of $51 million to $55 million. in the fourth quarter, 46% of our revenue was from our data center products, 46% from catv products, with the remaining 8% from ftth, telecom and other. in our catv products segment, the overall demand environment remains exceptionally strong as msos, particularly in north america, continue to upgrade their networks.
we generated revenue of $24.9 million, up 56.4% year over year and up 7.9% sequentially. looking ahead, we continue to have good visibility with catv orders as we currently have an unprecedented order backlog extending into q4 of this year. we believe that conditions in our catv market are likely to remain highly favorable into 2023 because our products are currently being used in network upgrade projects by the three largest catv msos in the u.s. along with other smaller operators.
in general, these network upgrades are still in their early phases, and all of the projects are currently expected to continue well into 2023 or beyond. our q4 data center revenue came in at $25.2 million, down 23.1% year over year and up 5.3% sequentially. in the fourth quarter, 14% of our data center revenue was from our 40g transceiver products, 79% was from our 100g products and 0.4% was from our 200g and 400g transceiver products. we are very pleased to have begun volume shipments of our 400g portfolio as these products have been under qualification by 11 different customers and the first design wins and associated volume orders give us increased confidence in our traction within the 400g data center market.
while we begin shipments of 400g, we are also preparing our first 800g samples, which we expect to deliver to the first of our interested customers at the end of next month. and we have begun concept discussions with several customers on ideas beyond 800g, including 1.6 terabits per second. so we can see a clear progression of increasing data rate products being developed by aoi and customer interest in these future product activities remains fine. now turning to our telecom segment.
revenue from our telecom products of $3.3 million was down 5.8% year over year and declined 36.1% sequentially. in line with our expectations, we saw continued volatility in market conditions in the china telecom market with respect to 5g rollouts. looking ahead, we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability until the pace of 5g rollouts in china becomes more predictable. for the fourth quarter, our top 10 customers represented 88.4% of revenue, up from 85.1% in q4 of the prior year.
we had three 10% or greater customers in the fourth quarter, one in the catv market and two in the data center market. these customers contributed 36.1%, 15% and 12.4% of total revenue, respectively. for the full year, we had three 10% or greater customers, two in the catv market and one in the data center market. these customers contributed 25.6%, 14.1% and 11.9% of revenue, respectively.
in q4, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 17.6%, which was below our guidance range of 18.5% to 20% and was down from 19.9% in q3 of 2021 and 27.5% in q4 of 2020. the decline in our gross margin was mostly due to unfavorable product mix and increased costs from component shortages. as we discussed last quarter, we have experienced price pressure on certain of our 100g data center products as these product lines have reached full maturity and 400g editions have begun. in addition, in our catv segment, we have seen an inventory correction on some of our higher-margin products by one of our customers that has significantly reduced orders for these higher-margin products.
these product mix issues overlap with well-known supply chain challenges and increases in shipping costs that also provide a margin headwind. finally, we've reduced production of lasers in our fab in q4 due to slower demand from the china 5g market, as well as managing inventory ahead of the lunar new year. this reduction in fab output resulted in under absorption of the fixed cost of running the fab and further pressured our margins. we believe most of these impacts are transitory.
while 100g margins are likely to continue to remain pressured, we expect these products to represent a smaller contribution to data center revenue as 400g begins its ramp, and we begin to see cost reduction associated with the transition to volume production. on the catv front, we have a number of cost reduction efforts that have been implemented to reduce raw material and production costs for our highest-volume products. in addition, we expect the unfavorable mix shift due to the inventory correction mentioned above to ease by midyear. while we expect margins in q1 to continue to be pressured by many of the factors i've already discussed and additionally by the effects of lunar new year on our asian operations, q2 and beyond currently looks significantly more favorable in terms of gross margin as these headwinds moderate or eliminated altogether.
total non-gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $16.9 million or 31% of revenue, compared with $20.6 million or 39% of revenue in q4 of the prior year. the reduction in operating expenses is due to a decrease in r&d spend as some of the costs associated with our 400g development have begun to subside, along with benefits from certain cost reduction efforts we made during the quarter. operating expenses were further improved by careful cost control, along with a significant reversal of previously accrued bonuses, especially to executives, which occurred in q4. we anticipate continued disciplined cost control until a return to consistent profitability has been demonstrated.
while we intend to carefully control operating expenses, we continue to invest in new product development. in addition to the 800g and 1.6-terabit transceiver work i discussed earlier for our data center customers, we also have been actively developing high-power lasers intended for use in lidar and other sensing applications. these lidar lasers have applications in automotive driver assistance systems, security monitoring, augmented reality and other 3d sensing systems. these products have been under development for several years now.
and within the last few months, we have begun shipping qualification samples to eight different customers, most of which are in the automotive space. initial feedback from these customers has been very positive, further reinforcing our conviction that aoi's laser-related r&d remains at the forefront of new technology, both in our data center market and in new markets like automotive. while meaningful revenue for these lidar lasers is likely a year or two away, the addition of these products continues the trend of greater diversity within our customer base. as many of you know, increasing revenue diversity has been a key element of our risk reduction strategy for more than three years.
non-gaap operating loss in the fourth quarter was $7.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.1 million in q4 of the prior year. gaap net loss for q4 was $14.5 million or a loss of $0.54 per basic share, compared with a gaap net loss of $13.4 million or a loss of $0.57 per basic share in q4 of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q4 was $5.5 million, or a loss of $0.20 per basic share, which was in line with our guidance range of a loss of $5.5 million to $6.6 million or a loss per share in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per basic share and compares to a net loss of $4.8 million or a loss of $0.20 per basic share in q4 of the prior year. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q4 were 27.1 million.
turning now to the balance sheet. we ended the fourth quarter with $41.1 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. this compares with $48.9 million at the end of the third quarter. notably, we reduced total debt, compared with q3 by $5.8 million by utilizing less of our revolving lines of credit at year-end.
as of december 31, we had $92.5 million in inventory, compared to $94.5 million at the end of q3. inventory decreased, primarily due to utilization of inventory for customer orders. we made a total of $2.3 million in capital investments in the quarter, including $2.1 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.1 million in construction and building improvements. we are still in the process of evaluating our capex plans for 2022, and we will share our expectations as soon as we complete our analysis.
moving now to our q1 outlook. we expect q1 revenue to be between $51 million and $54 million and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $8.3 million to $9.5 million and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.30 and $0.35 using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.5 million shares. with that, i'll turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from tim savageaux with northland capital markets. please go ahead.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. question on your -- well, your outlook and a comment you might have made about datacom. so as you look at the sequential increase you're guiding for q3, should we assume that's principally all cable tv catch-up? or is there anything else going on there on the one hand? and on the other, i think thompson made a comment about returning to year-over-year growth in data center.
was that comment about q3, the second half? or any particular color on that?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure. so the first question was about the nature of the sequential increase that we're forecasting in revenue. yes, a lot of that is related to the cable tv increase. data center, we think, will be kind of flattish sequentially.
and as far as the returning to sequential growth, that wasn't a specific statement on q3 or q4, but we said that at some point during the second half, so probably q3 or q4, we should return to sequentially -- to year-over-year growth.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. just a follow-up on that. given the orders in hand and additional design wins for 400 gig, it sounds like you expect that to ramp more materially in q4? or are you seeing any offsets in lower speed to kind of drive that flattish outlook for data center in q3?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i mean a lot of the 400g orders are going to start shipping later in q3. so there's not as much effect in q3 as you might otherwise -- would otherwise expect if it was going to be for the entire quarter. and then there's always some fluctuation in some of the lower stuff as well.
so we do expect to see some ramp in 400g but it will be toward the end of the quarter, more material in q4.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just one more. when you talk about the $5 million 400g orders, should we assume that's primarily from your kind of just, i guess, recently historically top customer? maybe you've just added your other historical top customer. but should we assume that's concentrated with one major cloud operator? and how does that initial kind of batch of orders in hand compare to the kind of total opportunity that you see with either that cloud customer or the two major cloud customers?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. so the orders that we've gotten so far bought for 400g, by and large, are not for the largest, the most recent largest major customer. it is for a couple of other hyperscale operators. as far as how we look at this opportunity, i mean, this is very much the beginning.
that $5 million represents an accumulation of orders that we've received during the quarter. so it's not like that just all happened, say, this month or this week or something where we would expect that to be some sort of run rate. but the purpose of that is really just to point out that we are starting to see a sizable backlog for orders, we're ramping our production capacity to be able to accommodate those orders and that we'll be delivering on those orders and presumably, additional orders that we'll receive between now and the end of the year.
operator
our next question will come from paul silverstein with cowen. please go ahead.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. stefan, what's the visibility, if any, to margin improvement? what are the -- what needs to happen? i recognize everyone's thinking about supply chain, yourselves included, but what needs to happen for gross margin to get up to more meaningful level from here?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks earlier, the biggest factor that's been affecting us recently has been just -- there's not one particular supply chain issue that i can point to. there's been a lot of various different issues that we've had. i think this is not untypical for other companies.
of course, not that, that's an excuse, but it's a little bit difficult to predict exactly what the trajectory of those pricing is going to be. as we noted in our prepared remarks, we've done quite a lot of work on qualifying second sources, finding alternatives. in many cases, redesigning products or portions of products to be able to accommodate components that are either more available or are available at a lower cost or hopefully both. so there's been a lot of activity that we've had.
the difficulty in translating all that activity into improved gross margin is that we have to -- if it's a redesign or something like that, we have to burn through the existing inventory. in some cases, the inventory that we're getting or the products that we're able to get are actually higher costs. so that kind of offsets what would otherwise be cost savings from other areas. so i mean, i think we're going to see improvement in gross margin toward the end of the year based on some of the new products that we have kicking in more meaningfully contributing to revenue at that time and also some of the anticipated cost reduction, the combination of some of the cost reduction efforts that we have had.
so our current expectation is from sort of an uptick in gross margin in q4. but i will hedge that a little bit by saying that, that assumes that the supply chain situation doesn't get materially worse, which seems like it's likely at this point, but one never knows.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
stefan, is what you're talking about getting back to the mid, high-20s for the incremental impact of supply chain? or you're not even talking about getting back to that level. and i guess we're always trying to get to was to get to 30-plus beyond supply chain, what needs to happen? what can supply -- just reparation of supply chain, what can that get you back to? and then to get to 30-plus, what needs to happen beyond supply chain normalization?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think the supply chain probably gets us back into the low to mid-20s. to get to 30%, we would need to see contribution -- significant contribution from some of our higher margin -- newer higher-margin products. so a mix shift in addition to the supply chain normalization.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
specifically to 400 gig or your --
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i'm sorry. go ahead, paul, i'm sorry.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
specifically, the 400 gig or you're speaking more generically in terms of new products?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
more generically about -- i mean, 400 gig can be a contributor there. that's certainly part of it, but other new products as well. and like i said, the time frame on the supply chain normalization, we think, is sort of q4-ish, again, barring any other things that happen. the new products, again, will start to kick in probably in q4, but it will probably contribute more meaningfully in quarters after that, so into 2023.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
and i apologize, i know you've addressed this in the past, but to get to breakeven, what does that assume in terms of volume and gross margin, your assumptions?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
right. well, we gave some guidance to operating expense. it's going to hover probably between $19.5 million, $20 million, something like that through the rest of the year. so you can kind of -- and i don't expect that to change meaningfully next year really either.
we've been fairly consistent in operating expense. so you can kind of do the math on the gross margin and revenue numbers that it would take to get to breakeven. as we said before, i think we can get back to the upper 20s or even 30s, maybe touch 30% at some point. it's not likely to happen in the next couple of quarters, given the trajectory that we just talked about.
so if you kind of assume that and plug in a, say, $20 million-ish operating expense, you can get a pretty rough idea on what the revenue level would need to be.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate it. thank you.

thompson? 
thompson lin -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, lindsay, and thank you for joining our call today. i will begin with some highlights from the quarter before. i'll turn the call over to stefan murry, who will discuss a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter. our second quarter revenue was adversely affected by a delay in the completion of several orders from a large catv customer that we expect to ship in q2.
during the quarter, the customer requested a certain change to several orders. but due to the well-known supply chain issues, we were unable to adjust production and procure raw materials to address these changes prior to quarter end, and the revenue, therefore, slipped into q3. we have since shipped substantially all these orders and also delayed. we recognize the result in revenue, this shipping delay negative impact our q2 revenue by approximately $6.7 million.
as a result, our total revenue for the second quarter decreased 3.5% year over year to $52.3 million, which was below our expectations. turning to the rate of our results. our gross margin was in line with our expectations, and non-gaap eps was above our expectations. total revenue in our catv segment of $23.7 million was down 14.1% year over year and was down 5.1% sequentially due to the reason i mentioned above related to the delayed shipping.
the overall demand environment remains robust as mso, particularly in north america, continues purchasing additional network products in order to upgrade their network. total revenue for our data center product of $21.5 million decreased 4% year over year and was essentially flat sequentially. as we have discussed previously, the slight year-over-year decline in delivered revenue is due to the decline in 40g, which is nearly the end of its life cycle. this decline was partially offset by an increase in 100g.
as 400g continues to ramp later this year, we expect year-over-year growth for our total data center revenue to be good. we continue to see good customer traction on 400g. today, we have received nearly $5 million in orders for our 400g products, most of which we expect to be shipped in q3 and q4 of this year. during the second quarter, we secured 8 design wins.
of these design wins, two are for our 400g products, both with existing hyperscale data center operator customers. we also had two design wins for our 100g products with hyperscale customers. we have two 100g wins with network equipment manufacturers supplying the data center industry. the remaining two design wins were in our fiber-to-the-home telecom and other categories.
with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q2 performance and outlook for q3. stefan?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, our second quarter revenue was adversely affected by a delay in the completion of several orders from a large catv customer that we had expected to ship in q2. during the quarter, the customer requested certain changes to several orders, that due to the well-known supply chain issues, we were unable to adjust production and pursue raw materials to address these changes prior to quarter end and the revenue, therefore, slipped into q3. we have since shipped substantially all of these orders and although delayed, we have recognized the resulting revenue in q3.
these shipment delays negatively impacted our q2 revenue by approximately $6.7 million. as a result, our total revenue for the second quarter decreased 3.5% year over year to $52.3 million, which was below our expectations and essentially flat compared to q1. while our revenue came in below our expectations, we delivered gross margin in line with our expectations and non-gaap eps above our expectations. we're encouraged by the strong catv environment, the recovery in the telecom market, and the traction we are seeing with our 400g products.
during the quarter, we secured eight new design wins. of these design wins, two were for our 400g products, both with existing hyperscale data center operator customers. we also had two wins for our 100g products with hyperscale customers. we had two 100g wins with network equipment manufacturers supplying the data center industry.
the remaining two design wins were in our ftth telecom and others category. we continue to see good customer traction on 400g, and we expect orders will ramp up in the second half of this year. on our q1 call, we have discussed how a major hyperscale data center customer selected aoi as a vendor for several of our 400g products. we are pleased to have completed the interoperability testing with the company's other prospective vendors and we have begun to receive sizable orders for shipments beginning in q3.
this was in addition to the two new design wins for 400g in the quarter that i just mentioned. one was with a major hyperscale operator and the other was with a smaller operator. these new wins further bolster our expectation for continued ramp in 400g later this year and into 2023. turning to our second quarter results.
45% of our q2 revenue was from our catv products, 41% was from our data center products, and the remaining 14% from ftth, telecom and other. in our catv products segment, the overall demand environment remains robust as msos, particularly in north america, continue purchasing additional networking products in order to upgrade their networks. however, for the reasons i mentioned earlier related to the orders that slipped from q2 into q3, we generated catv revenue of $23.7 million, down 14.1% year over year and down 5.1% sequentially. looking ahead, we currently expect strong sequential improvement in catv revenue in q3.
further out, we continue to have good visibility with catv orders as we see our backlog stretching throughout 2022 and into 2023. we have significantly increased production capacity for catv products and we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver on the demand that we are seeing. our q2 data center revenue came in at $21.5 million, down 4% year over year and up 0.4% sequentially. in the second quarter, 71% of our data center revenue was from our 100g products, 21% was from our 40g transceiver products and 1.1% was from our 200g and 400g transfer products.
as thompson noted earlier, we have booked nearly $5 million in orders already for 400g products. and with our production capacity ramping, we expect to ship most of these in q3 and q4 of this year. now turning to our telecom segment. revenue from our telecom products of $6.3 million was up 88.3% year over year and up 19.2% sequentially.
our strong second quarter performance was driven by a recovery in the china telecom market. looking ahead, we continue to expect to see fluctuations in revenue in telecom as the outlook for china telecom remains somewhat murky. for the second quarter, our top 10 customers represented 87.1% of revenue, up from 86.8% in q2 of the prior year. we had two 10% or greater customers in the second quarter, one in the catv market and one in the data center market.
these customers contributed 40% and 22.2% of total revenue, respectively. in q2, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 16.7%, which was within our guidance range of 16.5% to 18% and was down from 17.5% in q1 of 2022 and 25% in q2 of 2021. the decline in our gross margin was mostly due to continued challenges with the supply chain. total non-gaap operating expenses in the second quarter were $18.2 million or 34.9% of revenue.
down from $20 million or 36.9% of revenue in q2 of the prior year. r&d expenses decreased year over year, reflecting the timing of certain r&d projects, which we believe will come back next quarter. and our sales and marketing expenses benefited from some reduced shipping costs as well as lower personnel costs. looking forward, we expect non-gaap operating expenses to hover around $20 million per quarter for the rest of the year.
non-gaap operating loss in the second quarter was $9.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.5 million in q2 of the prior year. gaap net loss for q2 was $14.5 million or a loss of $0.52 per basic share, compared with a gaap net loss of $8.2 million or a loss of $0.31 per basic share in q2 of 2021. on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q2 was $7.6 million or a loss of $0.28 per basic share, which was better than our guidance range of a loss of $8.4 million to $9.5 million or loss per share in the range of $0.30 to $0.34 per basic share, and compares to a net loss of $4.1 million or a loss of $0.15 per basic share in q2 of the prior year. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q2 were 27.6 million.
turning now to the balance sheet. we ended the second quarter with $40.7 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments restricted cash. this compares with $40.1 million at the end of the first quarter. we ended the quarter with total debt of $63.8 million, down from $67.2 million last quarter.
as of june 30, we had $98.2 million in inventory, compared to $92 million at the end of q1. inventory increased, primarily due to the delay in shipment of the catv orders that we discussed earlier. we made a total of $1 million in capital investments in the second quarter, including $0.7 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.2 million in construction and building improvements. for the first half of the year, our total capex spend has been about $2 million.
looking ahead to the second half, we would expect flat to slightly higher capex spending. so for the year, we currently expect between $4 million and $6 million in total capex. before turning to guidance, i would first like to provide an update on the supply chain environment. we continue to see challenges in some areas of our supply chain, particularly semiconductors.
as in prior quarters, we have adapted to these challenges by purchasing materials from alternative often higher-cost sources. in some cases, we are able to reduce the impact by redesigning products to utilize components with better availability and cost, but this is not always possible for every shortage. we currently see approximately $1 million to $3 million in potential revenue reduction in q3 due to component shortages. however, this amount represents revenue that will be shifted to q4 and rather than lost revenue.
moving now to our q3 outlook. we expect q3 revenue to be between $57 million and $60 million, and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $7.6 million to $9.1 million. and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.27 and $0.32 using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.9 million shares.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from tim savageaux with northland capital markets. please go ahead.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. question on your -- well, your outlook and a comment you might have made about datacom. so as you look at the sequential increase you're guiding for q3, should we assume that's principally all cable tv catch-up? or is there anything else going on there on the one hand? and on the other, i think thompson made a comment about returning to year-over-year growth in data center.
was that comment about q3, the second half? or any particular color on that?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
sure. so the first question was about the nature of the sequential increase that we're forecasting in revenue. yes, a lot of that is related to the cable tv increase. data center, we think, will be kind of flattish sequentially.
and as far as the returning to sequential growth, that wasn't a specific statement on q3 or q4, but we said that at some point during the second half, so probably q3 or q4, we should return to sequentially -- to year-over-year growth.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. just a follow-up on that. given the orders in hand and additional design wins for 400 gig, it sounds like you expect that to ramp more materially in q4? or are you seeing any offsets in lower speed to kind of drive that flattish outlook for data center in q3?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i mean a lot of the 400g orders are going to start shipping later in q3. so there's not as much effect in q3 as you might otherwise -- would otherwise expect if it was going to be for the entire quarter. and then there's always some fluctuation in some of the lower stuff as well.
so we do expect to see some ramp in 400g but it will be toward the end of the quarter, more material in q4.
tim savageaux -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just one more. when you talk about the $5 million 400g orders, should we assume that's primarily from your kind of just, i guess, recently historically top customer? maybe you've just added your other historical top customer. but should we assume that's concentrated with one major cloud operator? and how does that initial kind of batch of orders in hand compare to the kind of total opportunity that you see with either that cloud customer or the two major cloud customers?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. so the orders that we've gotten so far bought for 400g, by and large, are not for the largest, the most recent largest major customer. it is for a couple of other hyperscale operators. as far as how we look at this opportunity, i mean, this is very much the beginning.
that $5 million represents an accumulation of orders that we've received during the quarter. so it's not like that just all happened, say, this month or this week or something where we would expect that to be some sort of run rate. but the purpose of that is really just to point out that we are starting to see a sizable backlog for orders, we're ramping our production capacity to be able to accommodate those orders and that we'll be delivering on those orders and presumably, additional orders that we'll receive between now and the end of the year.
operator
our next question will come from paul silverstein with cowen. please go ahead.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. stefan, what's the visibility, if any, to margin improvement? what are the -- what needs to happen? i recognize everyone's thinking about supply chain, yourselves included, but what needs to happen for gross margin to get up to more meaningful level from here?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks earlier, the biggest factor that's been affecting us recently has been just -- there's not one particular supply chain issue that i can point to. there's been a lot of various different issues that we've had. i think this is not untypical for other companies.
of course, not that, that's an excuse, but it's a little bit difficult to predict exactly what the trajectory of those pricing is going to be. as we noted in our prepared remarks, we've done quite a lot of work on qualifying second sources, finding alternatives. in many cases, redesigning products or portions of products to be able to accommodate components that are either more available or are available at a lower cost or hopefully both. so there's been a lot of activity that we've had.
the difficulty in translating all that activity into improved gross margin is that we have to -- if it's a redesign or something like that, we have to burn through the existing inventory. in some cases, the inventory that we're getting or the products that we're able to get are actually higher costs. so that kind of offsets what would otherwise be cost savings from other areas. so i mean, i think we're going to see improvement in gross margin toward the end of the year based on some of the new products that we have kicking in more meaningfully contributing to revenue at that time and also some of the anticipated cost reduction, the combination of some of the cost reduction efforts that we have had.
so our current expectation is from sort of an uptick in gross margin in q4. but i will hedge that a little bit by saying that, that assumes that the supply chain situation doesn't get materially worse, which seems like it's likely at this point, but one never knows.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
stefan, is what you're talking about getting back to the mid, high-20s for the incremental impact of supply chain? or you're not even talking about getting back to that level. and i guess we're always trying to get to was to get to 30-plus beyond supply chain, what needs to happen? what can supply -- just reparation of supply chain, what can that get you back to? and then to get to 30-plus, what needs to happen beyond supply chain normalization?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
yeah. i think the supply chain probably gets us back into the low to mid-20s. to get to 30%, we would need to see contribution -- significant contribution from some of our higher margin -- newer higher-margin products. so a mix shift in addition to the supply chain normalization.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
specifically to 400 gig or your --
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
i'm sorry. go ahead, paul, i'm sorry.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
specifically, the 400 gig or you're speaking more generically in terms of new products?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
more generically about -- i mean, 400 gig can be a contributor there. that's certainly part of it, but other new products as well. and like i said, the time frame on the supply chain normalization, we think, is sort of q4-ish, again, barring any other things that happen. the new products, again, will start to kick in probably in q4, but it will probably contribute more meaningfully in quarters after that, so into 2023.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
and i apologize, i know you've addressed this in the past, but to get to breakeven, what does that assume in terms of volume and gross margin, your assumptions?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
right. well, we gave some guidance to operating expense. it's going to hover probably between $19.5 million, $20 million, something like that through the rest of the year. so you can kind of -- and i don't expect that to change meaningfully next year really either.
we've been fairly consistent in operating expense. so you can kind of do the math on the gross margin and revenue numbers that it would take to get to breakeven. as we said before, i think we can get back to the upper 20s or even 30s, maybe touch 30% at some point. it's not likely to happen in the next couple of quarters, given the trajectory that we just talked about.
so if you kind of assume that and plug in a, say, $20 million-ish operating expense, you can get a pretty rough idea on what the revenue level would need to be.
paul silverstein -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate it. thank you.

thompson? 
thompson lin -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, lindsay, and thank you for joining our call today. i will begin with some highlights from the quarter before. i'll turn the call over to stefan murry, who will discuss a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter. our second quarter revenue was adversely affected by a delay in the completion of several orders from a large catv customer that we expect to ship in q2.
during the quarter, the customer requested a certain change to several orders. but due to the well-known supply chain issues, we were unable to adjust production and procure raw materials to address these changes prior to quarter end, and the revenue, therefore, slipped into q3. we have since shipped substantially all these orders and also delayed. we recognize the result in revenue, this shipping delay negative impact our q2 revenue by approximately $6.7 million.
as a result, our total revenue for the second quarter decreased 3.5% year over year to $52.3 million, which was below our expectations. turning to the rate of our results. our gross margin was in line with our expectations, and non-gaap eps was above our expectations. total revenue in our catv segment of $23.7 million was down 14.1% year over year and was down 5.1% sequentially due to the reason i mentioned above related to the delayed shipping.
the overall demand environment remains robust as mso, particularly in north america, continues purchasing additional network products in order to upgrade their network. total revenue for our data center product of $21.5 million decreased 4% year over year and was essentially flat sequentially. as we have discussed previously, the slight year-over-year decline in delivered revenue is due to the decline in 40g, which is nearly the end of its life cycle. this decline was partially offset by an increase in 100g.
as 400g continues to ramp later this year, we expect year-over-year growth for our total data center revenue to be good. we continue to see good customer traction on 400g. today, we have received nearly $5 million in orders for our 400g products, most of which we expect to be shipped in q3 and q4 of this year. during the second quarter, we secured 8 design wins.
of these design wins, two are for our 400g products, both with existing hyperscale data center operator customers. we also had two design wins for our 100g products with hyperscale customers. we have two 100g wins with network equipment manufacturers supplying the data center industry. the remaining two design wins were in our fiber-to-the-home telecom and other categories.
with that, i will turn the call over to stefan to review the details of our q2 performance and outlook for q3. stefan?
stefan murry -- chief financial officer and chief strategy officer
thank you, thompson. as thompson mentioned, our second quarter revenue was adversely affected by a delay in the completion of several orders from a large catv customer that we had expected to ship in q2. during the quarter, the customer requested certain changes to several orders, that due to the well-known supply chain issues, we were unable to adjust production and pursue raw materials to address these changes prior to quarter end and the revenue, therefore, slipped into q3. we have since shipped substantially all of these orders and although delayed, we have recognized the resulting revenue in q3.
these shipment delays negatively impacted our q2 revenue by approximately $6.7 million. as a result, our total revenue for the second quarter decreased 3.5% year over year to $52.3 million, which was below our expectations and essentially flat compared to q1. while our revenue came in below our expectations, we delivered gross margin in line with our expectations and non-gaap eps above our expectations. we're encouraged by the strong catv environment, the recovery in the telecom market, and the traction we are seeing with our 400g products.
during the quarter, we secured eight new design wins. of these design wins, two were for our 400g products, both with existing hyperscale data center operator customers. we also had two wins for our 100g products with hyperscale customers. we had two 100g wins with network equipment manufacturers supplying the data center industry.
the remaining two design wins were in our ftth telecom and others category. we continue to see good customer traction on 400g, and we expect orders will ramp up in the second half of this year. on our q1 call, we have discussed how a major hyperscale data center customer selected aoi as a vendor for several of our 400g products. we are pleased to have completed the interoperability testing with the company's other prospective vendors and we have begun to receive sizable orders for shipments beginning in q3.
this was in addition to the two new design wins for 400g in the quarter that i just mentioned. one was with a major hyperscale operator and the other was with a smaller operator. these new wins further bolster our expectation for continued ramp in 400g later this year and into 2023. turning to our second quarter results.
45% of our q2 revenue was from our catv products, 41% was from our data center products, and the remaining 14% from ftth, telecom and other. in our catv products segment, the overall demand environment remains robust as msos, particularly in north america, continue purchasing additional networking products in order to upgrade their networks. however, for the reasons i mentioned earlier related to the orders that slipped from q2 into q3, we generated catv revenue of $23.7 million, down 14.1% year over year and down 5.1% sequentially. looking ahead, we currently expect strong sequential improvement in catv revenue in q3.
further out, we continue to have good visibility with catv orders as we see our backlog stretching throughout 2022 and into 2023. we have significantly increased production capacity for catv products and we believe that we are well-positioned to deliver on the demand that we are seeing. our q2 data center revenue came in at $21.5 million, down 4% year over year and up 0.4% sequentially. in the second quarter, 71% of our data center revenue was from our 100g products, 21% was from our 40g transceiver products and 1.1% was from our 200g and 400g transfer products.
as thompson noted earlier, we have booked nearly $5 million in orders already for 400g products. and with our production capacity ramping, we expect to ship most of these in q3 and q4 of this year. now turning to our telecom segment. revenue from our telecom products of $6.3 million was up 88.3% year over year and up 19.2% sequentially.
our strong second quarter performance was driven by a recovery in the china telecom market. looking ahead, we continue to expect to see fluctuations in revenue in telecom as the outlook for china telecom remains somewhat murky. for the second quarter, our top 10 customers represented 87.1% of revenue, up from 86.8% in q2 of the prior year. we had two 10% or greater customers in the second quarter, one in the catv market and one in the data center market.
these customers contributed 40% and 22.2% of total revenue, respectively. in q2, we generated non-gaap gross margin of 16.7%, which was within our guidance range of 16.5% to 18% and was down from 17.5% in q1 of 2022 and 25% in q2 of 2021. the decline in our gross margin was mostly due to continued challenges with the supply chain. total non-gaap operating expenses in the second quarter were $18.2 million or 34.9% of revenue.
down from $20 million or 36.9% of revenue in q2 of the prior year. r&d expenses decreased year over year, reflecting the timing of certain r&d projects, which we believe will come back next quarter. and our sales and marketing expenses benefited from some reduced shipping costs as well as lower personnel costs. looking forward, we expect non-gaap operating expenses to hover around $20 million per quarter for the rest of the year.
non-gaap operating loss in the second quarter was $9.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.5 million in q2 of the prior year. gaap net loss for q2 was $14.5 million or a loss of $0.52 per basic share, compared with a gaap net loss of $8.2 million or a loss of $0.31 per basic share in q2 of 2021. on a non-gaap basis, net loss for q2 was $7.6 million or a loss of $0.28 per basic share, which was better than our guidance range of a loss of $8.4 million to $9.5 million or loss per share in the range of $0.30 to $0.34 per basic share, and compares to a net loss of $4.1 million or a loss of $0.15 per basic share in q2 of the prior year. the basic shares outstanding used for computing the net loss in q2 were 27.6 million.
turning now to the balance sheet. we ended the second quarter with $40.7 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments restricted cash. this compares with $40.1 million at the end of the first quarter. we ended the quarter with total debt of $63.8 million, down from $67.2 million last quarter.
as of june 30, we had $98.2 million in inventory, compared to $92 million at the end of q1. inventory increased, primarily due to the delay in shipment of the catv orders that we discussed earlier. we made a total of $1 million in capital investments in the second quarter, including $0.7 million in production equipment and machinery and $0.2 million in construction and building improvements. for the first half of the year, our total capex spend has been about $2 million.
looking ahead to the second half, we would expect flat to slightly higher capex spending. so for the year, we currently expect between $4 million and $6 million in total capex. before turning to guidance, i would first like to provide an update on the supply chain environment. we continue to see challenges in some areas of our supply chain, particularly semiconductors.
as in prior quarters, we have adapted to these challenges by purchasing materials from alternative often higher-cost sources. in some cases, we are able to reduce the impact by redesigning products to utilize components with better availability and cost, but this is not always possible for every shortage. we currently see approximately $1 million to $3 million in potential revenue reduction in q3 due to component shortages. however, this amount represents revenue that will be shifted to q4 and rather than lost revenue.
moving now to our q3 outlook. we expect q3 revenue to be between $57 million and $60 million, and non-gaap gross margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%. non-gaap net loss is expected to be in the range of $7.6 million to $9.1 million. and non-gaap loss per basic share between $0.27 and $0.32 using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.9 million shares.
with that, i will turn it back over to the operator for the q&a session. operator?
