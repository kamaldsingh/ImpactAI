welcome to century casinos q3 2019 earnings conference call. this call will be recorded. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
good morning everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton.
before we begin, we'd like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings and encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including but not limited to adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investors section of our website at cnty.com.
i'll now provide a brief review of the company's financial results for the third quarter 2019 and following the prepared remarks, there will be a q&a session.
results of the existing properties were mixed. the canadian segment was up, thanks to the newly opened century mile racetrack and casino. the us colorado segment was down slightly, while poland was up significantly. overall, net operating revenue was up 22%, adjusted ebitda was up 12%.
in canada, all our three casinos in the edmonton market showed good growth. century casino & hotel edmonton and the century casinos in st. albert grew revenues by 1% and 3% and adjusted ebitda by 1% and 12% respectively. century mile racetrack and casino in south edmonton generated solid revenue, but the expense side of the business, the bottom line is still work in progress. that's not unusual for a newly opened casino, it takes about a year until the property reaches its full potential and century mile is well on its way. operations continue to ramp up and we are pleased with the revenue generated at the property. we continue to analyze the cost structure, the staffing levels and efficiencies of century mile to achieve the margins we expect.
in calgary, our two properties, century downs and century casino generated even better revenue growth, namely 6% and 3% respectively. adjusted ebitda was up at century casino and slightly down at century downs, due to one-time expenses associated with a high profile track record racing event that was held in august and some construction related margin disruption. we are very excited about the upcoming opening of the expansion of century downs. it will increase the gaming floor by about 20% and will open in two weeks. total capex is approximately $1 million, remember we don't have to pay for the slot machines and we expect to generate at least that same amount in incremental ebitda per year.
in the us, our two operations in colorado were down slightly year-over-year. as i mentioned several times previously, colorado is a very competitive market and in some quarters you win market share, in others you lose a bit, all depending how heavily others are spending on promotions and comping. we hope that tomorrow, november 5, retail and online sports betting will be voted in colorado. we are in negotiations with various sports betting companies for partnerships to provide high quality and competitive offering for our customers. key points for any such agreements and partnerships include quality and experience of the sports betting partner as well as revenue splits and annual minimum guarantees to us. sports betting operations in colorado could start as early as in the summer of next year and we will be well prepared for it.
in poland, revenue was up 28% in local currency, ebitda almost tripled. the growth came from both the slots and the table games at all locations. and the newly expanded gaming floor at our flagship operation, the casino at the marriott hotel in warsaw continues to ramp up nicely.
in the uk the casino in bath still disappoints and the outlook remains challenging as the gaming business throughout the uk is being hampered by tough regulations regarding anti-money laundering, social responsibility, and general data protection. we have started a strategic review of this investment with all options on the table and plan to make a decision in q1 of next year.
now a quick look at our balance sheet and liquidity. we have $44 million in cash and cash equivalents and $71 million in outstanding debt. the total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is 2.7, the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is 1.0. our debt includes $52 million related to our bank of montreal credit agreement, $15 million related to the century downs long-term land lease, and $4 million in europe. the book value per share increased to $6.09. capex for existing operations during the quarter was $2.1 million or 3.9% of revenues, which includes about $0.5 million for the gaming floor expansion at century downs in calgary.
let me now give you an update of the eldorado acquisition. as most of you know in june of this year, we announced the acquisition of three casino operations from eldorado for $107 million at an impressively accretive 4.1 acquisition multiple. well, that has become even more exciting, because these three operations have continued their strong performance resulting in a decrease of our purchase market to 3.6, which is really fantastic. these are three quality assets in strong and stable gaming markets each enjoying a leading regional position and each with a long track record of producing solid and growing revenue and ebitda. with this acquisition, we pretty much doubled the size of our company, which underlines the truly transformational nature of this deal. the transaction is subject to gaming regulatory approval in missouri, as well as customary closing conditions. we expect it to close in late 2019 or very early 2020.
throughout the quarter, our accounting operations, it and marketing teams have visited all three operations in missouri and west virginia, number of times to ensure a smooth takeover. we are very happy to report that local managements of all three properties will come with us and stay in place. and we have already identified some short-term low cost measures to increase business volumes and increase operating efficiencies. while we will rebrand the two missouri properties to century casinos we leave the well-established mountaineer brand in place.
on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred year ago, we have five casinos in the us, five in canada, and eight smaller ones in europe with a total of 7,200 gaming machines, 270 gaming tables, 430 hotel rooms, and three horse racetracks. and we generate net operating revenue of $415 million and adjusted ebitda of $58 million. these numbers do not include any synergy effects at all. and going forward, we expect revenue and ebitda to grow further due to the new century mile ramping up, expansion at century downs, and new sports betting revenue in colorado subject to vote approval tomorrow. that's all really exciting. it's more than doubling our revenues and ebitda. so therefore it's pretty surprising to me that our stock price has not reacted more positively to it yet. i'll be on the road in new york and chicago later this week to get the story out, i hope that will help.
we'll finance this transaction with $170 million term loan facility for which we have a bank commitment from macquarie capital. this facility will also take out the existing debt we have with bmo right now. on a pro forma basis, our leverage on traditional net debt is 2.5 and now our lease adjusted net debt leverage is 4.1. this conservative capitalization together with a strong operating performance and great relationships with gaming reits, should provide us ample capacity to pursue further growth opportunities especially as the regional gaming trends in north america remain healthy.
all right that pretty much sums up another successful and very active, very busy quarter for us. i thank you for your attention. and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead please.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from david bain with roth capital. your line is open.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
great, thank you. congratulations on the acquisitions, again, especially the way they're trending. i know you mentioned there were some short-term low cost measures with the acquisitions. do you elaborate on what those are and give us any sort of financial impact return. hello? do you hear me.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
i hear. this is erwin.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. i'm sorry, i -- okay, i was just speaking to the -- well, maybe -- if you could help possibly on basically synergies as it relates to the eldorado acquisition. and if you can elaborate on any of these sort of short-term low cost measures that you mentioned in the press release and on the call to impact the properties.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
right. so the one of the things we will do is that in caruthersville and in mountaineer, we intend to get some new slot machines. so we identified the lowest performing machines and we intend to replace them with new ones. in that context, it is important to mention that in west virginia, the west virginia lottery commission pays for 60% of the slot machines, slot machine purchase. we haven't identified the exact numbers yet, but that will be one of the very obvious things to do. then in addition to that we see already some pressures in marketing tweaks. as you know, eldorado has been pretty aggressive i should say in reducing marketing spend and we would like to probably to loosen up slightly. not much, but slightly and fine tune in one or the other area.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and then looking forward at north america acquisitions. obviously the field -- the opportunity field is growing and you have a lot of dry powder i would call it, particularly in tandem with the reit right partner. i guess two questions, kind of your basic overall thoughts on today's market opportunities? and then, the other one being, what's the optimal mix for century in terms of being asset light so to speak in terms of ebitda generation or mix of properties that you own versus others that you have the landlord essentially and if that's really just deal specific or any sort of thoughts there? and then do you look at real estate monetization of existing properties. so that's kind of a multi-tiered question.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
okay. in the -- i will respond in the reverse order. and peter, when you are back on again please let us know. we do not intend to monetize any of the existing real estate we have, we have no plans with regards to that.
second question, with regards to the optimal mix. as of today, we think that we should -- we should do it. so let's say opportunity based. so it is not our intention to become to have everything financed with -- it's a combination of recent operating company, it may well be that we continue to outright purchase. but it will depend on where we are -- if and when an opportunity comes up that we think is attractive.
and third question, today opportunities. we are monitoring what's out in the market there, but at this very moment first of all, number one priority is to focus on the smooth transition to begin with and once we have that under the belt then it looks more proactively again. but at the moment, there was nothing that was so appealing that we couldn't say no.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
got it. okay thanks erwin. and peter, if you are there, thank you as well.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
i'm back in. thank you.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
thank you. okay, that's great. thanks, peter.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
that's why we [indecipherable]
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
that's true.
operator
your next question comes from brad boyer with stifel. your line is open.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the questions guys. first question is kind of a three part question around century mile. obviously you know we're another quarter into the ramp there, revenues looking to be heading in the right direction. i guess, could you give us a sense of how the revenues are ramping there and sort of how you're seeing that market evolve given that you guys have additional assets in the market. are you shifting play around, are you growing the market, are you taking trips from competitors. just some flavor around the revenue environment there.
and then secondarily, obviously, the margins were a bit weaker than what everyone was expecting. i guess the question now is how should we think about the margins ramping from here? and along those lines, are you guys still confident in sort of that, i think on the low end, we were talking about $10 million for a while there sort of the run rate ebitda number. but are you still comfortable with that number? and what gives you comfort in that number? thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
erwin.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
peter, would you like? okay. we are, as peter said earlier the revenue side is already very good and we're happy with the way how it developed. on the cost side, we are intensely working on getting the cost down and it's pretty clear where we have to get cost down and we implemented as fast as we thought possible, which should show an impact, if i say that cautiously at the very latest in q1 of 2020, if not in q4 already.
with regards to the competitive -- to the overall market, we have generally speaking been able to perform better than the market for -- actually i would say for the -- definitely for the two -- other edmonton casinos that we have. so we -- we think we have a good grip on the market and the strong relationship to our core and repetitive players. specifically with regard to the century mile, we see our main competitor is river cree. they have been hit a little by our -- by the opening of our casino and now they are i think back as well as they can. and we think that going forward this will continue to be our main competitor. but there is no reason not to be confident, then what gives us confidence is, if you look at how we handle century downs, we're initially the first year also was little bit choppy, but now four years later, the numbers are so good that as you know, we are expanding. so we have full confidence and trust in our operating and marketing capabilities.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just around the deals with eldorado. i know in the past, when you guys announced the deals, you were talking about the potential for some sort of minor capex items potentially. i know there's a hotel adjacent to caruthersville, i think we were talking about -- just curious if you have any updated thoughts there. and then, i don't know, peter, if you could sort of give us just a flavor for modeling, sort of what you anticipate sort of capex looking like on the other side of the deals closing?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
peter, shall i start and you follow and you come in with the second question. seems that peter maybe gone again.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
let me hit that. first of all, initially there is no deferred capex. so when we think of the profit, everything is in good order, except as i said on the low end, low performance [technical issues] sorry for that, i don't know where they came in. brad, can you still hear me. brad?
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
yes, i can hear you. thanks.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
okay, very good. now, when, with regard to the first more substantial capex measures like as we mentioned the hotel across the road in caruthersville, we'll evaluate little more and we -- in our conversations with management, we certainly talked -- we came to the conclusion that this is not the number one priority we need to focus on. there are other things that are more important than, i think that probably it'll be a year or two into us having taken over before we make any capex decisions of a large account, a little bit of replacement capex here and there, small measures may be trends that are -- maybe putting a second line [indecipherable] here or there, some operational efficiency improvements, but nothing, nothing much. does that answer your question?
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
yes, it does. that's very helpful. and then i guess, lastly, just around bath. could you just give us a little bit better sense of sort of what this strategic review entails? i would imagine, given some of the headwinds in the market, potentially finding a buyer could be pretty difficult in this environment. so i mean, is there a scenario that you envision where you could potentially just kind of shut this down and walk away from it? or how are you thinking about sort of the path forward there to the extent that the operations don't improve here? thanks.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
all right. yes, the answer is a clear yes. we can imagine everything also just closing it down, obviously we cannot just close the doors. so we are now looking at the various avenues that we can go, because clearly we intend to keep all of our contractual obligations. but we're in the middle of checking that while at the same time we still try to -- have the full effort to try to see whether there is any kind of turnaround possible. but at the moment everything -- i think i should say this, we anticipate that we will not have that pain in our income statement and balance sheet for an extended period of time.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay, very helpful. thanks for all the color erwin.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
by all means. thank you, brad.
operator
your next question comes from mike malouf with craig-hallum. your line is open.
mike malouf -- craig-hallum -- analyst
great, thanks guys for taking my question. i just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the century mile, obviously the cost side running ahead of where we were expecting and you sort of think that we can get some good traction, perhaps maybe even as early as this quarter, but certainly in march quarter, where are you taken as far as action. i mean, are we still trying to get to that sort of mid-20s ebitda or 20% to 25% ebitda in 2020 or are you talking to trying to get to that point at some time during the year, next year and then it will be a slow ramp from here. can you just give us a little bit of sense on timing, that would be helpful.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
yeah. i'd love to, but let me be cautious. our ambition is certainly 2020, but at this point in time, i wouldn't want to promise it. we just have to -- to dig into a very heavily and then work hard on getting the cost at hand while at the same time also ramping -- further ramping up our marketing approach. so i'd love to be able to say it, but let me just be cautious.
mike malouf -- craig-hallum -- analyst
yeah. okay. and how about on seasonality, can you give us a little -- sort of help on the seasonality, it was down sequentially in the september quarter. how does the fourth quarter typically look for that, what are you expecting for that, property seasonally and as we go throughout the year?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
very generally speaking -- all our properties are less seasonal than they might appear. that is even true for colorado in spite of the strong differences between winter and summer, but what has to be said is in our properties in canada as opposed to colorado nobody has to drive up a mountain. and clearly people in canada are used to drive it in inclement weather as well. so that have always turned out to be less of a problem. we -- i don't see -- we don't really check into seasonality a whole lot. we rather look at these swings that may depend on how heavily our competitors working on the marketing side. as peter mentioned earlier, they are quarter times one or two of the competitors run there -- a very big marketing campaign that may have an influence here and there, but we always look at the long term there.
mike malouf -- craig-hallum -- analyst
yeah. got it. okay, great, thanks for the help.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
certainly.
operator
your next question comes from john decree with union gaming. your line is open.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
hi, erwin. thanks, for all the additional color so far. just wanted to touch on poland, i think we've covered the us and canada, and now that warsaw is ramping and the licensing process has been behind us for a while. i think before all that started the margins in poland were 14% almost 15% and rebuilding nicely here. i was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on if that's attainable again and what the timeline might be to kind of get back to normal operating margins in poland.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
right. as you said -- the operations are -- it's wonderful to see how well they are coming back and even the smaller ones. i mean, let me remind all of us we always get the question, why do you keep the small casinos, that has to do with the whole licensing arithmetic. it is just advantageous to have the smaller casinos as well when you go into relicensing, to say very generally. but the -- i think we continue the both the revenue and the ebitda side very well. there is only one thing that we expect in 2020 that we have to raise the tail rate a little bit across the board and that may slow us down in the ramping up again. but again, in general terms, we think we can come back to the ebitda margins that we used to have.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate the additional color. thanks, erwin.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
by all means, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from kenneth jovanovic [phonetic] with [indecipherable]. your line is open.
kenneth jovanovic -- analyst
thank you. my question has to do with the losses at corporate and other and i know you discussed that some of that was with bath, england. are there any other --- losses that are attributable to corporate and other because i noticed on the earnings statements that corporate and other has been a bit of a drag on the overall picture for century and is there anything that can be done to eliminate further eliminate losses coming from that sector?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. some of it has to do with the cost that we have in connection with the eldorado acquisition. peggy, would you like to go into more detail?
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
sure. so most of the costs running through corporate and other or the losses running to corporate and other are related to the bath -- to bath, that is rolled up into that segment. and then yes, of course, we have some additional expenses running through right now related to the acquisition.
kenneth jovanovic -- analyst
okay. and do you anticipate the first full year of operation of the acquisitions from eldorado, giving all things being equal, assuming that the results are the same as they were in 2019 for 2020, do you anticipate a positive earnings picture?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
just arising out of this -- of the newly acquired properties, you're asking?
kenneth jovanovic -- analyst
yes.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
and are you asking whether we think we do the same or more?
kenneth jovanovic -- analyst
yes, i'm saying all things being equal if things we're no different in 2020 versus how they -- how they were for these casinos in 2019. would you anticipate a profitable operation for all three?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
yeah, definitely -- definitely.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
yes, absolutely. kenneth this is peter, i'm back in. and what we say is that on a pro forma basis, we would expect our full year with the new acquired operations we expect to generate about $415 million in revenue and $58 million in ebitda.
kenneth jovanovic -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question comes from andrew gordon with ef gordon capital. your line is open.
andrew gordon -- ef gordon capital -- analyst
hey, good morning gentlemen. just -- apologize if i missed this, i mean [00:30:19] [indecipherable], i may not have heard you touched on this, but the $58 million trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda on consolidated basis, does that attribute -- how much does that attribute to the eldorado acquired properties?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
that's the full year. we sold three properties and it is approximately half-half? is that right, peggy?
andrew gordon -- ef gordon capital -- analyst
[speech overlap] roughly 29 million then?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
29 million or 30 million i believe.
andrew gordon -- ef gordon capital -- analyst
got it. so next question i'll make it quick. i just want to get a little clarity on what the realistic net leverage numbers should be on a pro forma basis consensus numbers for 2020 ebitda, were -- i think around $41 million for 2020 and coming into this call and you're now attributing around $30 million to the newly acquired properties. so let's say it's roughly $70 million on the slightly outdated estimates, the net leverage i believe is supposed to be around maybe a little over $100 million. so on a looking forward basis, i think your pro forma net leverage should be maybe 1.5 or better. and i just wanted to clarify and make sure that you guys agree with that because at least one of your analyst i believe has been looking on trailing basis in attributing three times net leverage. and i just thought that -- like if we could all benefit from a low clarity?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
net debt on a pro forma basis, we'll be closer to 130. and the ebitda number that you mentioned could perhaps be a little bit aggressive, because as we now know century mile is ramping up a bit slower than expected, those would be my two comments to your calculation.
andrew gordon -- ef gordon capital -- analyst
okay. all right, i'll follow up offline. thank you.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
thanks andrew.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from patrick arnold with energy management. your line is open.
patrick arnold -- energy management -- analyst
hi. first, i'd like to say congratulations on your acquisition. our question was more along the lines with your participation with the reit and what you might -- when or what might be the disposition of the xx acreage in west virginia?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
yes, erwin, do you have any color on that? we, as you know patrick we do not own the land. that is owned [indecipherable] so maybe that's the question -- so we have no plans in regards to that.
patrick arnold -- energy management -- analyst
all right. the follow-up to that was obviously you guys are coming into the emergence of the marcellus and the energy gas sector here. did you have any kind of unique marketing plans or thoughts that trying to encourage them to come to your facility at mountaineer what i'm looking at here is austin town, north of us is created kind of a niche for those guys as well based on the large cracker plant that's going into manac [phonetic] about 24 miles north. have you guys looked at that at all or thought of it?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
yes. definitely and -- go ahead peter sorry.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board co-chief executive officer & president
no, i was just saying that, yes, we -- that obviously part of our market [indecipherable] and we are formulating those plans, but erwin please go ahead.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board co-chief executive officer
no, i just wanted to just say the same. we are very excited that this is happening and then most definitely we will be target at those new customers.
patrick arnold -- energy management -- analyst
yes. since it is -- as an influx here well, congratulations again. and thank you for your time on the call. thank you.

operator
welcome to the century casinos q1 2020 earnings conference call. this call will be recorded. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thank you, ron. good morning everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann, as well as, our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton. we hope all of you, your friends and families are safe and in good health during these challenging times of the covid-19 pandemic.
as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings and encourage you to review these filings. in addition, throughout our call, we'll refer to several non-gaap financial measures including, but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release and sec filings available in the investors section of our website at cnty.com.
i'll now provide an overview of the company's status quo in light of the current crisis and then briefly review the financial results for the first quarter 2020. following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
as with almost all casino companies, we closed our operations between march 14 and march 17 to comply with quarantines issued by governments to contain the spread of covid-19. all of the closures are temporary, with the exception of the casino in bath, u.k. which remains permanently closed. in december of last year, we were in sale negotiations for the bath casino. however, in march, not surprisingly, the potential buyer terminated the negotiations. due to the canceled sale and the negative outlook, we determined that the best course of action would be to voluntarily wind up the bath casino company. we signed a voluntary liquidation resolution last week and with that, no more losses from bath will impact our results.
in addition, after conservative analysis, it was determined that the goodwill and license value of some of our operations is impaired and $33 million have been written off in the quarter. during the closures, we have temporarily laid off and furloughed approximately 90% of our team members except for poland where all employees will continue to be paid reduced salaries based on local employment laws. we recognize the impact that these furloughs has on our team members and we have tried to mitigate a little bit this impact by continuing to provide benefits coverage. we committed to paying benefits to all our u.s. and canadian employees, inclusive of part-timers through the end of may. the remaining staff, including senior management, have taken pay cuts and officially working on budgets, negotiating with vendors, banks and lessors to manage the cash front, on hr issues and on securing and maintaining our properties and preparing them for reopening.
our payroll is down significantly and many variable costs fell away while operations are closed. we have many other expenses like interest in our debt, rent and lease expenses for some of our properties. real estate taxes, insurance, utility cost and other expenses continue to occur even while operations are closed. we are currently generating only very limited revenue from our properties and the net cash outflow during the time the operations are fully suspended is close to $8 million per month, that is including full debt service and rent payments. what can we do to lower that number further and preserve cash? we've recently been able to negotiate the deferral of rent for the land at century mile at edmonton for the month of may, june and july. the deferral is up for one year and is interest-free. we've amended the master lease with vici to raise the minimum capex requirements for 2020 and convert it for next year. that helps us with around $2 million. other possible modifications of that master lease like partial rent relief or rent deferrals are also topics for future discussions with vici.
as you know, there are several federal and state relief programs in place in the u.s. as well as in canada. the specific rules are still evolving, but unfortunately we are pretty certain that at this stage, we will not qualify for any of these programs, either due to size, revenue levels, or existing leverage.
our balance sheet has no near-term maturities and we are in full compliance with all our debt obligations as of march, 31 and also expect that to be the case for the second quarter. as of april 30, we had $50 million in cash. again our monthly cash burn is close to $8 million, including debts and rent service. our casinos, we need approximately $19 million to reopen operations and cover short-term cash needs at the properties.
talking about reopening, two days ago on monday, we announced the reopening of our casinos in europe, in poland. we opened all eight casinos on monday morning. visitation was good and the social distancing and health and safety requirements didn't seem to pose any real difficulties. our guests were very understanding of the situation and very happy to be able to enjoy real gaming entertainment again after two months of closure. before the closures, poland contributed approximately 10% of our total consolidated ebitda.
in west virginia, the governor announced that effective may 14, horse racing may resume with no spectators allowed. following this announcement, horses [indecipherable] in the banned area and started training at our mountaineer facility already. the first race is scheduled for may 31. we will hold three races per week, all without on-site visitors. this will be very good for pari-mutuel horse betting handle and will help lowering the cash burn at that property.
our golf course in west virginia is also open already and is busier than ever. according to the latest information available, we expect to be able to open the gaming floor at mountaineer on friday, june 5. in missouri, we should be allowed to reopen our two casinos in a couple of weeks in early june based on information currently available. that will be very good news for us because missouri is our most important market in terms of ebitda generation. as for the reopening of our casinos in colorado, we are currently anticipating early to-mid-june. and in alberta, canada, adw internet betting on horse races is generating some revenue already and we will also open the restaurants at some of our canadian properties next week. that has already been approved and should generate not only s&p revenue, but also increase the betting action on horse races. casino operations in edmonton and calgary will probably start sometime in the second half of june.
so, clearly, the timing and the official guidelines regarding the reopenings will differ by jurisdictions. and the various approaches and requirements laid out by the governments and regulators will likely include things like the use of infrared devices to check employee and guests for fever, reduced levels of gaming, restaurant and entertainment spaces, social distancing in slot machines, table games and the restaurants, the provision and use of gloves, face masks and hand sanitizers, continuous disinfection of high-touch surfaces at shorter intervals, limited restaurant opening hours or keeping restaurants office closed and other measures to account for varying levels of demand. we've been through all of that in our planning over the last weeks and we feel comfortable with these requirements. most of our revenues stems from slot machines and it's actually relatively easy to deploy social distancing in the slot machine areas. our slots, for us, are not very often at greater than 50% occupancy anyway, as we've always chosen to have enough slot machines.
our achievements [phonetic] in diversity and our locations in hyper local markets will play a role in our recovery, especially in the early stages where we can expect some pent-up demand. moving into us being in the gaming industry for around 40 years and have operated casinos in the u.s. and internationally through a number of challenging times, including 9/11, growth combat in 2000 and the financial crisis 10 years ago. each time, the casino industry has recovered and over time came back even stronger especially in the hyper local gaming markets where we play. all our casinos predominantly rely on very local and very loyal customer base. and as such, our operations should ramp up at a quicker rate than casinos at destination resorts. all our customers are locals in urban and suburban locations with the vast majority of our business coming from customers who live within 45 minutes from our facilities. our casinos has negligible meeting and convention business and very few of our customers is aiming travel by air to reach with us.
in addition, we offer a comparatively inexpensive gaming experience, one that is often still affordable in economically difficult times. so, from everything we can see and from what industry consultants are forecasting, local gaming should ramp up considerably faster than destination gaming. the reopenings will probably be limited from an amenity perspective and we will probably see a more pure gamer that comes to the facilities, at least initially. on top of that, don't forget, most of our customers in the local markets are people who are not in the active workforce, people with pensions with fixed income plus, they also get the stimulus check from the government.
and finally, if the recent reopenings of casinos are any indication, for example, in south dakota, oklahoma in indian country we have all reasons to be optimistic. i'm sure you all saw the reports that their opening weekend were about 15% to 20% higher than the typical weekend in spite of social distancing restrictions. also, a couple of days ago, when southland casino, west memphis opened, we got reports of a long line around the building.
in concluding my prepared remarks, here's a brief overview of our performance in q1. our results for the first quarter of 2020 really for us is a study in contrast. january and february were great months, really great months. also march started very strong and we were on pace to generate approximately $105 million in revenue and $20 million in adjusted ebitda for the quarter. both would have been all-time records, significantly higher than our own forecast and higher than consensus estimates. then came temporary closures in mid-march and we ended the quarter with $87.7 million in revenues and $9.6 million in adjusted ebitda increases over last year's first quarter of 92% and 44%, respectively. the growth up until mid-march was substantial and it was broad based. colorado's ebitda was up 20%, canada was up 19% and also the three new properties we acquired from eldorado performed exceptionally well. combined, the ebitda was 25% higher compared to last year and the eldorado ownership. we really look forward to ramping up to these kinds of results as soon as possible after reopening.
so on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and patience during this difficult times as we manage to properly position our businesses for the reopenings in the new normal. i thank you for your attention and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead please.

ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of david bain with roth capital.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
great, thank you, peter, erwin and margaret. hope you guys are well. as we reopen, are there some permanent or structural changes that you've identified that could allow for better flow-through or additional concepts that could carry more profitably generated revenue and can that carry forward to 2021? and if so, can you speak to the most significant differences as you open and target that?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin, would you like to start that?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
all right. hi, david.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
hi, erwin.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
we haven't done any -- we have not done any structural changes apart from the fact that we used the time in poland in our mariott casino, which is the busiest casino of all of poland to completely revamp it, including redoing an air conditioner, which really needed it. and that was quite a job. so it kind of came in handy, if you want to say, and we used the time to completely redo that. and now well equipped for all temperatures that some might bring to give a pleasant experience to our guests. but other than that, we didn't do anything structural. however, we, like many other companies have once again rethought our strategies and we definitely, more than ever, will focus on the value players -- on the upper end of the players. and that in itself, probably, say, is a good thing given the fact that we will have capacity limitations in all likelihood in most of our casinos.
we, again, like others, will further push for digitization which should again bring some cost savings on the marketing side and, i guess, these are the main things that we have done from -- so far. most of this is fluid and most of it we will have to play by ear and see how it develops. we are all ready to adapt quickly basically on a day-to-day basis depending on what the various jurisdictions will will ask from us, so that we're able to react quickly.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
got it, ok. and then as a follow-up, can you break down sort of the larger pieces of the $19.8 million reopening costs? is some of that earmarked as cached capital? i mean, just -- if you can give us what the larger buckets are, that would be helpful. and then just assuming the reopenings are on schedule or on the schedule that you gave us in the prepared remarks, it sounds like cash in june should still be $22 million, $23 million as cash flow begins to generate again. is that kind of a fair estimate?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
margaret, please?
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
yes. so, david, that $19.8 million is mostly cached cash and then some -- just some operating cash just based on the way cash flows for paying gaming taxes and things like that. and, yes, you're correct, we should be in the $22 million, $23 million range.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay, great. thanks so much and congrats on the january, february results, particularly with the acquisitions. thanks so much.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
okay.
operator
and we do have another question. the next question comes from the line of chad beynon from macquarie. please state your question.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my questions. good to hear that you're well. firstly on a normalized level of revenues to reach breakeven ebitda, understanding that your properties have different cost structures and tax rates, is there kind of a range of what you need to get to, to get these properties to breakeven once they're open? thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
on a property -- our property basis, that level is about 35% of pre covid-19 revenues.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you. and then just back on the liquidity situation. so, can you just kind of help us get comfortable with the cushion that you have here? if it's $20 million of cached cash, you're at $50 million at the end of april. that just leaves you a couple of months. did you or are you exploring other sources of liquidity to maybe give you a little bit more cushion or are you just comfortable with, i guess, the timeline of openings and cash flow that you're projecting in the near term? thank you.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we -- yeah, we have plans in the upper draws, so to say. we have proposals, term sheets on the table for additional credit lines. we are also in ongoing discussions with vici about other things that they can do to help us other than the capex requirement. and -- but we are, of course, also are seeing that the capital markets are open, should we want to do anything. and we also -- as you know, we also own 100% free and clear, many of our properties in colorado, for example, also in canada. so we could, if we wanted to do something with that real estate as well.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
okay, makes sense. thanks, peter. best of luck.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of brad boyer from stifel. please state your questions.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the questions, guys. first, was just around the monthly cash outflow number of $8 million. could you tell us how much of that is just pure opex relative to everything else?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
do you have that, peggy?
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
brad, it's a little bit difficult to just come up with pure opex in this situation. we're dealing with paying -- the cash flow is mostly related to loan repayments and vici and insurance payments, things like that.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes, so, brad, vici and the interest and principal on the macquarie loan, those two together is about $3.5 million already.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just second question is around capex. i assume you guys are embedding some incremental roll-back there in light of what we're -- how are you thinking about kind of capex for the remainder of the year at this point?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
just really is a minimum, erwin. yes? would you like to comment?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
yeah, it's a little [indecipherable] necessary.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we've redone our casinos in girardeau are in great shape, as you know and just in the fourth quarter, we've opened an expansion at century downs. so, yeah, we have -- so we've cut it back to the minimum and we don't have any things that are really necessary right now.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then i realize it's a very, very short window. but could you provide any additional color around what you've seen in poland thus far? and i think more importantly, have you seen any bifurcation in customer behavior with regard to slots relative to tables? any color there would be helpful. thanks.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
absolutely. peter, it's fine if i respond to the question?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
please.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
now, first of all, we opened in the night from sunday to monday because at midnight from sunday to monday we were allowed to open and three minutes after opening across the eight casinos in poland, we had already 100 [phonetic] guests in there although that's quite an unusual time of the day, i would say. and the results for the first day is obviously, this is very early on, have been produced against the backdrop of us not being able to market it all. you know, we have a strong marketing restrictions in poland. so it's really word of mouth that was going there. and -- but i think i could say everything looks very good. we are not far away from -- after two days already, we're not far away from a cash flow breakeven. and from the customers, which is -- how do your customers feel, how do the employees feel. i think the employees are all used to wearing the mask, and wearing the gloves if they have to, or masks or shields they can wear. and the customers only have to wear their masks. but again everybody is used to that by now, because it's not, obviously, not only the casinos where you have to wear the masks.
and with regard to the favors in slot. there is not too much of a shift, because as you may remember, due to the polish gaming law, we can only have a maximum of 70 slot machines per casino license. so these slots that we have has been very well placed, they were already at 60% of playoff pre- covid times in the first two nights and the tables are ramping up a little slower because of the seat reduction that we're having. but overall, the assessment of us and of our management there is very positive. they're really excited about the business that we could see in the first days.
brad boyer -- stifel -- analyst
perfect, thanks for all the color, guys and good luck on getting things back on line here.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
thank you.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thanks, brad.
operator
and we do have more questions. our next question comes from john decree from union gaming. please state your question.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
hi, everyone. two questions. one, i wanted to ask a little bit more about the $8 million cash need per month and probably getting a little granular but with poland reopened and some racing in canada and west virginia, should we think about the actual cash net outflow going forward from here being something less than $8 million, now that there is a little bit of revenue back in the system?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we should but can you quantify that, peggy?
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
probably too early, right? [indecipherable] the $8 million if everything was still closed?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes, yes.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
yes.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
oh, ok, ok, that's helpful. and then...
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
but we think -- ok.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
go ahead, erwin, i'm sorry.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
no, i just wanted to say basically poland we think is the [indecipherable] carrying it already probably in a week from now and the next months kicking in, we'll see how they will come along.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
good, very good. okay. in canada, with the volatility and kind of sharp drop in oil prices, has that or do you expect that to have any impact on your business when it reopens? and then any comments you can provide on the kind of continued ramp of your new property in edmonton would be helpful.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
in alberta, we also have a lot of business from retired people. so they are not affected by the oil situation and also don't forget the recent decision on the expansion of the trans mountain oil pipeline that, up there, everybody's enthusiastic about it and it should lead to a very strong recovery. on top of that, now after the recent reduction in the provinces' corporate tax rate, alberta has the lowest corporate tax rate of all provinces in canada, 8%. so they are doing a lots of things to stimulate the economy and we actually -- we see pretty encouraging signs. in terms of ramping up of century mile, back to erwin, please.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
it's just a little too early to say. you know, it would be speculation. we have to open and see how it's going. the property is in perfect shape, everything's fine or the ancillaries are there, once we can start the racing again. we are ready, but i would not speculate at this point in time about how quickly we can ramp.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
for january and february at century mile, have you seen kind of continued growth or margin improvement over the fourth quarter before covid at century mile?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
we have, but it's been pretty cold there so those two months certainly have been weather -- impacted by weather and again, it's not really representative of what we see over the whole year.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
got it. fair enough. thank you, everybody.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
thanks, john.
operator
and we do have more questions. the next question comes from the line of hana wilmart [phonetic] from centennial research. please proceed to state your question.
hana wilmart -- centennial research -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i was just wondering if you guys see any opportunities to make acquisitions coming out of the current covid environment.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we see it a little bit but it's surely not our main focus right now. yeah. it's too early, and while we are -- i think things are being brought to us, so we are aware of what's happening out there. we see some opportunities, but right now it's definitely not our main focus.
hana wilmart -- centennial research -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up on that is, is there any sort of environment when you'll feel comfortable starting to look more into those opportunities?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
i think after the summer. after the summer, we -- if we are in good shape as we believe we will be with the reopenings occurring throughout the month of june, that would be a very busy time for us any day.
hana wilmart -- centennial research -- analyst
great, thanks so much for the information.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we do have another question on line. this comes from the line of alex silverman from awm investments. please state your question.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
hi, there. you are -- are there any states or provinces that are talking about temporarily reducing gaming taxes in order to help the casinos?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin, do you have any ideas on that?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
yeah, there is discussion about it in colorado and conversely, there is also in alberta, in short, in alberta there is also a discussion about it.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
i'm sorry, colorado and where?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
alberta, canada.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
and alberta. got it.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
yeah.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
second question, you said getting casinos back to 35% of pre-covid revenue on a property level would be breakeven. i assume that's property level breakeven. and then on top of that there is the corporate expense?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
that's right, yes. and i said 35%.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
35%?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes. and that's on a property level.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
got it. and then last question, i know that different states are discussing requirements in terms of social distancing and such. at your peak, whatever friday or saturday night, what kind of utilization do you typically have for your slots at your different facilities?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
i would say between, depending on their circumstances, between 45% and 60%. [speech overlap] yeah. go ahead.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
no. please go ahead. no, please.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
i wanted to say that has to do with our policies that we always try to make sure that we have enough product available on the floor so that our customers always can choose and are not forced to play machine just because it's free, although it's not the one they really would like to play.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
so if a peak level is 45% to 60%, requiring that you only have 50% of your machines operating in order to separate people shouldn't be that big of a stretch for you guys.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer
that's very correct. exactly, that's how we see it as well.
alex silverman -- awm investments -- analyst
okay, that's all i got. thank you.
operator
at this time there are no other -- there are no further questions. i will now turn it back over to our host.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president

operator
welcome to century casinos' q3 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann, as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton. as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings and encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investor section of our website at cnty.com.
i'll now provide an overview of the third quarter results and after that, there will be a question-and-answer session. if it wasn't for the corona pandemic, we couldn't be more excited. on a consolidated basis, we have achieved all-time record numbers in the third quarter despite these challenging conditions. net operating revenue of $95.7 million represents an 81% increase over q3 of last year. adjusted ebitda was $22.2 million, more than 3 times higher than in q3 of last year. these fantastic results clearly reflect the successful integration of the three casinos we acquired late last year and the tremendous progress our local operating teams have made since we reopened all properties about five months ago.
the strong trends we saw in june and july continued throughout the third quarter, increased spend per visit, more time spent on device plus increased return of our core customer. with a somewhat reduced capacity on our casino floors and limited amenities for our guests, overall visitation to our properties was down compared to last year, but we quickly rebalanced our operating and marketing approach without compromising a great customer experience. being selective with our amenities, keeping strong controls on the promotional environment and staying focused on the high margin areas of our business brings expense reductions and new efficiencies, resulting in significantly higher operating margins. while we currently see that positive trends continuing, we have little visibility regarding the impact the corona pandemic will have on our markets going forward. yet, we see continued upside with the older demographics and they are often times more valuable, feel comfortable returning to our casinos in higher numbers. and we also expect some of the newer, younger customers will convert to regular visitors.
the third quarter was the first full quarter including the results of the three properties we acquired from eldorado in december of last year. when we closed that transaction, we said it was a truly transformational deal for our company, and now we can demonstrate that with hard facts. our net revenue almost doubled, our ebitda more than tripled, and it's become a clearly u.s.-focused operation with 79% of our total ebitda coming from the u.s., 17% from canada and 4% from europe.
let's now look at the performance on a segment basis, starting with colorado. it was a great quarter for our properties in cripple creek and central city. net operating revenue was up 13% and adjusted ebitda more than doubled as ebitda margin jumped from 25% to 46%. in colorado, each city has different gaming floor restrictions. in cripple creek, the full slot floor is open but table games are expected to remain closed for the remainder of the year. in central city, the casino is currently operating approximately 65% of the slot machines and the blackjack tables are open. for both cities, alcohol sales stop at midnight, but the casinos are able to operate 24/7. while limitations on the number of slot devices are difficult to manage, we see a significant increase in time on device. there's low volumes of players but the players that do come are spending significantly more. we see our core customers as well as some new younger customers and they are coming more often, staying longer and spending more.
during the quarter, we announced our third sports betting partnership deal with tipico. all three partnerships pay us a percentage of revenue with a minimum guaranteed amount per year. this is without an investment or cost participation from our side, so it flows straight to the bottom line. one, that is the circa sports site is up and running already. the other two plan to launch next year.
on tuesday, colorado voters approved amendment 77, which authorizes the three gaming towns, cripple creek, central city and black hawk to remove the current $100 maximum bet limit as well as to introduce new table games such as baccarat. currently table games comprise less than 15% of total gaming revenue, which is well below the 25% of comparable regional gaming markets, clearly indicating significant upside for colorado. the improved table game offering will appeal to new customer segments and higher wealth customers and we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.
moving onto missouri, which is our most important market in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation. at our two properties in cape girardeau and caruthersville, about 95% of all slot machines and approximately 53% of our table games positions are available for play and the results for the quarter were fantastic. compared to q3 of last year, when the casinos were under different ownership, we've managed to grow net operating revenue by 4% and adjusted ebitda by 33%. we increased the ebitda margin from 32% to 41%. our missouri properties have done a great job in focusing on serving the best customers in an environment of reduced operating expenses and highly targeted marketing. as a consequence, the primary driver for these great results was an increase in the average bet per player of approximately 16%. additionally, handle pulls per hour has increased. guest appeared to be playing slightly faster and betting more, which is driving the increase in revenue per player. furthermore, the slight decline in the admissions has primarily come from lower-end players. high-end players remained strong since the properties reopened.
next is, west virginia where we reopened our mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort in early june. currently, the gaming floor offers 86% of the slot machines and about 39% of the table games positions for play. some of the food and beverage outlets have reopened with limited hours of operation. the convention space remains closed and the hotel is operating with limited rooms available. ebitda was down 11%. the third quarter started rather soft in july and early august, mainly because smoking was temporarily banned at that time and we have only had less than half of the slot machines in operation. from the middle of august on, we were able to allow smoking again and to increase the number of slots to where we are today, that showed positive results immediately with september ebitda up 13% year-over-year.
currently, hotel occupancy at mountaineer runs at 88% from sunday through thursday and at 98% on fridays and saturdays, prompting us to reopen another wing of the hotel with around 100 rooms shortly. additionally, we have just installed another 30 slots in the very popular smoking section. because of its resort character, mountaineer will greatly benefit from a softening or an end of the current corona situation more so than pure locals casinos and it will also benefit when the over 55 demographic feels comfortable again to come out in larger numbers, so we feel there's good upside.
now let's take a quick look at our operations in canada, edmonton, calgary. the gaming floors are currently operating approximately 60% of the total gaming machines. our hours of operation are limited. there are restrictions on spectators at the racetracks and the hotel and showroom in edmonton remain closed. table games traditionally drive an important part of our business there because of the asian population. we're only allowed to reopen on september 7, so no strong contribution in the quarter at all. even so, ebitda was down only 10% at our edmonton properties and down only 5% at our calgary operations. the better performance were the two recsinos, century mile in edmonton and century downs in calgary. and as mentioned on a consolidated basis, the canada segment accounts for 17% of the company's ebitda.
to conclude our look at the operating segments, we look at europe, where our casinos in poland had a softer quarter, while the casinos in the smaller cities around the country, which draw most from locals are doing well, the results of the two larger casinos in the capital city of warsaw are softer because of the lack of tourists and business travelers. anyway, the operation is cash flow positive and accounts for only less than 5% of our total ebitda.
with that, a few words about our balance sheet liquidity and outlook. as of september 30, we had $62 million in cash and cash equivalents and $184 million in outstanding debt on the balance sheet. the outstanding debt includes $168 million related to the credit agreement with macquarie, $10 million of bank debt in europe and $15 million related to a long-term land lease for century downs in canada and that's all net of $10 million in deferred financing costs.
we do not foresee any substantial capex in the short and mid-term. all our properties are in good shape and we have put all non-essential capex projects on hold for now. for next year, we believe we will return to our more normalized capex program of reinvesting about 3% to 4% of net revenues into our properties. we are off to a very strong start after reopenings and we make sure we stay focused on maintaining a disciplined approach throughout our business, avoiding unnecessary costs and efficiencies and inefficiencies to creep back in. we fully intend to keep the focus on a more efficient higher margin business in place after this crisis is over. overall, our business has been remarkably stable with almost all of our business coming from customers who live within driving distance to our properties, we've successfully executed a strategy built on our premium local customers.
and as you look at the preliminary results for october, the positive operating trends from the third quarter have continued. monthly ebitda is roughly in line with july, august and september. but as mentioned at the beginning, we have little visibility regarding the impact this pandemic will have going forward. with that on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guest and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our businesses during these challenging times. thank you for your attention and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead please.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from david bain with roth capital. please state your question.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
great, thank you. thank you and congratulations on the quarter. i was hoping, we could discuss corporate strategy, first, if it's ok and potentially divesting or pruning some of the smaller maybe non-u.s. portfolio, how that makes sense for capital redeployment or if it does? essentially, i guess kind of trading into heavier domestic ebitda, utilizing some of that lower-ranked non-u.s. portfolio piece and potentially mitigating equity components as you get larger. is that fair to think about or how are you guys looking at that at this point?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
yes, dave. we have sold the casino operations in calgary a couple of months ago and we still own the real estate but as you can imagine that's not really our intent to hold it for a very long time, so we will intend to sell that real estate in calgary. and then the european operations now make up 4% of our total ebitda, so that has moved to a very interesting and important part of our business a couple of years ago to being in non-core. and therefore, you may assume that we are thinking of trying to get a good deal for these assets in poland. and on the acquisition front, yeah, absolutely, we see quite a lot of very interesting opportunities in the u.s. the regional players are -- have become very, very big and naturally they are somewhat less interested in some of the properties that would be very important for us. we've now shown that we can successfully negotiate contract, close and then integrate a large transaction. and so i think that makes us a good buyer for some more of these mid-size assets and so yeah, we are out looking already, so i think next year will be a very, very busy m&a situation in the u.s.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
all right. fantastic, that's great color. and then if i could ask one more follow-up or one follow-up. as we -- we watched the gaming stocks move on, on covid news almost seemingly daily, and i'm curious as to what you see on the ground in terms of the visitation or spend volatility lessened in various markets or -- i'm not talking about the structural hurdles mandated by the agencies, i'm talking about on news spikes. are you seeing any of that same volatility that we see in the market or has this been a fairly even recovery? and then just as kind of a bifurcated component to that, any 4q events to be aware of that may have caused disruption? i don't know it's like voting with the election or new years versus last year to kind of couple with that positive momentum that we see with west virginia?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
i don't see any of these events. erwin, would you like to give your color on those two questions?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
yeah. with regard to the volatility on recent events, we don't see that volatility in the u.s. and canada, but we see it in poland.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
again, as peter said before, not very important.
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
great, and then new years and things like that shouldn't be overly material as we look at this year versus last?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
no. [speech overlap]
david bain -- roth capital -- analyst
okay, so that's like a -- ok, great quarter again. thank you.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
thanks, dave.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from chad beynon with macquarie.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. peter. you ran through the great detail with all of the segments. wanted to dive into the sustainability of the margins and thinking about some costs that are currently out of the business, if they could come back, so in markets where your margins were really high and the number of positions were low and some of the non-gaming was low, should we think that the margins will decline as some of these come back online? and then the second part of that, yeah, how are you thinking about reinvestment rate and labor currently right now? thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
erwin, would you like to start?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
yes, happy to. we are -- we really would like to keep the margins and we think we have a realistic chance to do that. we'd be very hesitant to reintroduce the things that -- a number of the things that were there before. and when i say that we also -- we hear that our competitors thinking exactly the same way and that is quite a good chance that everybody in any competitive market will have the same attitude and just not reintroduce -- in fact most particularly on the lower end of the -- of course, we gave away to the players with less volume. and that is also true with regard to the reinvestment rate. we feel comfortable with where we are and again, unless there is something really shattering happening, we want to hold on to our current strategy. concerning labor, once again, what we have now is fine. if we should -- but it could be that we have to add labor, i mean, naturally, we will have to add labor if and when we get table games reintroduced, where we don't have them yet and if we should widen the f&b of guest also, but it will all be very well thought through and it will be really zero budgeting nothing -- so nothing would just be reintroduced because it was there before.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
great, thanks. and then on the amendment 77 passing, how should we think about the opportunity? i believe, you said that currently less than 15% of revenues come from tables and this will obviously increase that percentage, but do you believe that tables can climb up to more of a national average. and then how should we think about the timing of when this can go into effect, obviously notwithstanding other regulations going on with tables in colorado?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
yeah, the timing, i think sometime end of q1, early q2. and with regard to the quantitative effect, it's really difficult to project, but what i can say is that in both our properties in cripple creek and in central city, we have a number of very nice hotel rooms that are certainly competitive. so we have the tools to entertain and we think it's good to offer adequate hotel rooms to players that want to pay higher volumes.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
thank you. last quick one, just on the free cash flow conversion from ebitda, looks like it was a little bit light and there were some working capital headwinds this quarter. how should we think about a normalized percentage of flow through to cash flow from operations and should that working capital start to swing back, given you're in a more normal period? that's all for me. thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
hey, can you give some comment to that?
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
sure. q3, we had some cash outflows catching up on things that were pushed off during the pandemic. we had a large payment on a gaming license in west virginia that was $2.5 million. so there was just a few higher cash flow items that you wouldn't see in ebitda, because they were in previous quarters and we expected -- it will normalize now in q4.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
thanks. nice set of results.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
thanks, jeff.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john decree with union gaming.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
hi, everyone. answered most of my questions already, but just one from me and i wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the older demographic that hasn't quite returned yet, given the pandemic and it's something that your peers have talked about a little bit. just wondering, if you can give us a sense of how important that segment is. if there's kind of any way you could quantify it? is it a big piece of your database and how much has come back so far? has it been -- it's trailed other segments, but has the half come back, less than that? just any kind of rough guidelines would be good, given how important that segment is to the industry.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
we see that at mountaineer as well as in colorado and in the missouri. erwin, do you have some more detail on that segment?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
not to answer exactly this question. we look at it from the volume of play, just as much as from the age, but if i would have to guess, i would say, more than half the players are back and that is particularly during the higher volume play.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
got it. and was that segment more frequent customer? i guess, as we kind of try to understand it, when you think about those segments, are they coming more often? do they generally spend more? i guess, what kind of makes them a bit more valuable or important when you think about upside going forward?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
both, yeah. they come more often and they spend more. they stay longer and that's -- yeah, that is why it was enough, right?
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
yeah, that's great.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
and in addition to that, they are purely interested in the gaming side of things. they are not so much interested in the other amenities that we offer. they are mostly pure gamers, which makes them again higher margin people.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
right.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
yeah, that's great. and i guess, that's kind of a good segue into my follow-up question. i think, you talked a little bit about marketing and labor, but in your prepared remarks, you've mentioned kind of being selective with the amenities that you bring back and you're kind of still attracting younger demographics that are going to convert hopefully into real customers. how do you think about bringing back amenities as the pandemic hopefully winds down in the not too distant future? is there some amenities that are maybe going to go away permanently? how do you think about bringing some of those back and what you might need or not need to bring back?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co chief executive officer
we have no intention to bring any of the phase back, so they are -- i think they are gone permanently, whatever permanently means, but certainly, in any foreseeable future, we don't intend to have any of the phase back. and then when it comes to the other, you can take the food and beverage outlet, we would just take a step-by-step approach. for example, the steakhouse in mountaineer, that is not so much catering for the younger people, that is more, can i say, 40, 45 plus. as peter mentioned earlier, maybe not even that important, the sports bar restaurant in mountaineer attracting younger people, yes, that probably comes on the weekends, probably move on with the next steps out of post-pandemic. but it will be a little bit of the trial and the error and that we will approach cautiously and with the attitude to rather err on the side of offering lower -- too few than too many opening hours.
john decree -- union gaming -- analyst
thanks, erwin. congratulations on the quarter everybody.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co chief executive officer and president
thanks, john.

welcome to century casinos' q4 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann, as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton.
as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings and we encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including but not limited to adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investor section of our website at cnty.com. i'll now provide an overview of the fourth quarter results. after that, there will be a question-and-answer session.
net operating revenue increased by 26% and adjusted ebitda grew by 87% over q4 of last year. over 80% of ebitda comes from our operations in the us, where four out of five properties posted strong gains in both revenue and ebitda. we are pleased with the robust results for the quarter, even though our casinos in canada and poland were closed over the busy christmas holiday season. in our disclosures, we estimate our ebitda in q4 would have been $20 million or more than double that of last year. this great performance is also the result of the successful integration of the three casinos we acquired a little over a year ago, and the tremendous progress our local management and operating teams have made since we reopened all properties.
since we reopened in june that was the three casinos we acquired from eldorado, we have been able to grow ebitda by a combined 26% compared to the same time last year under the previous ownership. that, by the way, on an annualized basis, reduces the acquisition market where we paid for these operations down to as low as 3 times.
the trends we saw in the summer continued throughout the fourth quarter, increased spend per visit and more time spent on device. with a somewhat reduced capacity on our casino floors and limited amenities for our guests, overall visitation to our properties was down a little compared to last year. but being selective with our amenities, keeping strong controls on the promotional environment and staying focused on the high-margin areas of our business brings expense reductions and new efficiencies resulting in significantly higher operating margins. as you know, this is an industrywide trend and it looks sustainable. we believe these higher margins will continue to be attainable throughout 2021. and we also see more upside when the older demographics feel more comfortable returning to our casinos in higher numbers.
let's now look at the performance of each reporting segment, starting with colorado. it was a fantastic quarter for our properties in cripple creek and central city. net operating revenue was up 20%, and adjusted ebitda more than doubled to $3.4 million. the ebitda margin jumped from 20% to 36%.
in colorado, each county has different gaming floor restrictions. in cripple creek, the full slot floor is open and half of the table game positions are in operation as of today. in central city, the casino is currently operating approximately 65% of the slot machines and half of the table game positions. we see a significant increase in time on device and players are spending more per visit. our market share went up in both markets, but most significantly in cripple creek from 10.5% to 13%. one of our three sports betting partnerships is already up and running. the other two plan to launch later this year. all three partnerships pay us a percentage of revenue with a minimum guaranteed amount per year. this is without any investment or cost participation from our side, so it flows straight to the bottom line.
and in a couple of months on may 1, colorado casinos will be allowed to remove the current $100 maximum bet limit and introduce new table games such as baccarat. table games currently comprise less than 10% of total gaming revenue, which is well below the 25% of comparable regional gaming markets, clearly indicating some upside for our colorado operations. the improved table game offering will appeal to new customer segments, for example, the asian community and higher worth customers, and we are looking forward to capitalize on this opportunity.
moving on to missouri, which is our most important market in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation. about w properties in cape girardeau and caruthersville, about 95% of all slot machines and 58% of all table game positions are available for play.
results for the quarter were again fantastic. compared to q4 of last year, we managed to grow net operating revenue by 3% and adjusted ebitda by 31%. we increased the ebitda margin from 33% to 42%. the growth was carried by both properties in cape girardeau and caruthersville, equally, they managed to achieve similar growth rates. in caruthersville, even had the highest slot coin-in in q4 in the property's history. the primary driver for these great results was an increase in the average revenue per player of approximately 40%. additionally, handle pulls per hour have increased. guests appear to be playing slightly faster and betting more, which is driving the increase in revenue per player.
overall visitation is down a little, but we clearly see that the decline comes more from the lower end of the database, while play from higher end players remains very strong. table game revenue, which usually is contributing significantly, has lagged behind the strong slot volumes because guests are still not allowed to smoke while seated at the gaming table. we hope that restriction gets lifted soon, that will be a good upside for us in missouri. and the possibility of sports betting legislation later this year or next provides additional upside in that market.
this quarter, our missouri properties go live with a new mobile app, which creates lots of opportunities to further increase customer loyalty and also save significantly on direct mail expenses. the app focuses on increasing customer engagement and provides guests access to all amenities and promotions with full account visibility and the ability to take advantage of earned rewards and offers.
next is west virginia, where the mountaineer casino, racetrack and resort had a more challenging quarter. ebitda was down 30%. however, that is not surprising at all because of a temporary smoking ban, and more importantly, the curfew in ohio, where the majority of mountaineer's business comes from. currently, the gaming floor offers 94% of the slot machines and 45% of the table game positions for play. some of the food and beverage outlets are open with limited hours of operation, but the convention space remains closed and the hotel is operating with limited capacity.
because of its resort character, mountaineer will greatly benefit from a softening of the covid-19 situation, probably more so than pure local casinos. and it will also benefit when the over 60 demographics feel more comfortable again to come out in larger numbers. additionally, mountaineer's best quarters are the summer quarters, q2 and q3, so we feel there is good upside ahead. sports betting at mountaineer racetrack and casino operates in partnership with william hill, and online casino gaming is expected to go live next quarter in partnership with the rush street interactive and also with william hill.
our international operations in canada and europe had a difficult quarter. combined, they contributed $3.7 million in ebitda. it is down from $7.8 million in q4 of last year. we operated under heavy capacity restrictions for most of the quarter and had to close for the christmas holiday season, which usually is very busy. since then, poland has reopened in mid-february, but from what we hear, most likely we'll have to close again soon. canada is still closed. on a consolidated basis, these international segments account for 19% of the company's total consolidated ebitda. as reported, we are in talks with several parties about the sale of the polish casinos. but as of today, we can't predict the outcome of these discussions and negotiations.
with that, a few words about our balance sheet, liquidity and outlook. as of december 31, 2020, we had $63.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $184.6 million in outstanding debt on our balance sheet, resulting in net debt of $121.2 million. the outstanding debt included $168.3 million related to the macquarie credit agreement, $10.2 million of bank debt in europe, and $15.3 million related to a long-term net lease for century downs in canada, all of that net of $9.3 million in deferred financing costs. we do not foresee any substantial capex in the short and midterm. all our properties are in good shape. we have put all non-essential capex projects on hold for now.
on a normalized basis, we reinvest approximately 3% to 4% of net revenues into our properties. overall, our business has been remarkably stable, with almost all of our revenue coming from customers who live within a 1.5 hours drive from our properties. we have successfully executed a strategy based on our premium local customers, and we fully intend to keep the focus on a more efficient, higher-margin business going forward. we see continued upside from creating efficiencies and synergies with the recently acquired casinos from eldorado. and as mentioned, we have more sports betting table game growth coming in colorado. we look forward to our casinos and racetracks to reopen in canada and to an overall very busy summer season in north america.
with that, on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our businesses through these challenging times.
thank you for your attention, and we can now start the question-and-answer session. operator, go ahead, please.
",":
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question here comes from jeff stantial from stifel. please go ahead with your question.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
hey, great. thanks. good everyone. thanks for taking our questions. i want to start with your operations in the us, if possible. we've heard from several of your regional peers that generally, things started to pick up sequentially in january and february. is this something you're seeing across any of your us markets?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes, we've seen that with the exception that we have about seven to 10 days in february, especially in the midwest, where the ash winter storms, it has some impact. but other than that, erwin, that's right. we see some good performance, right?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
definitely, yeah. definitely. exactly as you said.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. and then moving on to the canada closures and the potential upcoming poland reclosures, can you help us frame what the ebitda burn rate looks like for those assets? that's my understanding, it's more limited in canada comparatively given some government subsidies. but just any parameters around that to help us think about our models would be great.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
i think, peggy, maybe you can elaborate on that. sorry. peggy you can give us the numbers and then also include the effects of the government subsidies that we get in colorado -- in canada.
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
so for canada, net from a cash perspective, where you look at burn rate from a cash perspective, we're burning about $600,000 a month in cash. and that is we are getting subsidies back as well. for poland, let's see. you can pretty much -- from an ebitda perspective, poland is going to burn, there's a -- it will be running negative ebitda. let me see. poland probably will be a negative $300,000 or $400,000 in ebitda every month.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and just to be clear, on the canada burn rate, any -- can you -- what sort of sits below ebitda if you're thinking about from a cash perspective? i'm just trying to -- and if you don't have these numbers on that, we can take this offline.
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
yeah. i don't really have these numbers right in front of me, but we can pull them together.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay, perfect. yeah. thank you. appreciate that. one other quick one, if you don't mind, lastly on poland, i appreciate that you can't elaborate further on an outcome there, but i was wondering if you could just help frame for us how you're thinking about pricing those assets? and what i mean by that is, are you thinking about things on a multiple of 2019 ebitda? or kind of how is the potential buyer handicapping the recovery time line there? and that's all for me. thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
no, obviously, i mean, everybody talks about normalized ebitda. but then again, it's difficult to say what normalized ebitda means, not necessarily 2019 numbers. and so yes, it's probably going to be somewhere around the 2019 numbers and based on that, reasonably marketable. so yeah. but difficult to say at this stage.
i mean poland has a unique situation, and it's extremely difficult for outsiders to enter the market. so it's a great place for the incumbents, and that means every license that you have there has a pretty high value on the one hand. on the other hand, the license has a life of six years. so it's -- yeah, it's a difficult question how to put the value on it because our company, casinos poland, has had its licenses for the last 30 years, also always has been relicensed. interesting discussions with the potential buyers, and we probably should know more about -- in about four to six weeks.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. that's really helpful. thanks, everyone. i really appreciate the color and congrats on a strong quarter.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thanks, jeff.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david bain from b. riley financial. please state your question.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
great. thanks. and congratulations on another quarter of margin and i guess, just overall execution. my first would be broad based, just we've heard a lot of domestic operators speak to a greater mix of a younger demographic. and now with the vaccine rollout, that core older demographic seems to be returning. i guess, one, are you seeing that same dynamic? and then two, if so, have we captured maybe a broader demographic out of covid? or do you think the demographic will simply rebalance over time? any kind of thoughts around that would be helpful.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin, do you have any thoughts on that?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
yeah. we don't really see that -- what you have described, david. we have -- our demographics now are pretty much the same as they've always been. and so in the -- as a percentage distribution of age, but what we expect is that as the restrictions ease up or the vaccinations progress further, that more of the lower-end players will come back. but that not necessarily has an impact on the change in demographics in our casinos.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
okay. interesting. thanks. and then if we look at the missouri and west virginia acquisitions, i think you were able to implement some improvements that have had a positive impact with little capex. just looking at the targets that you may be reviewing today, is that the same type of dynamic you look for, like small things that you can do immediately to drive margin or revenue? or should we view the next acquisition a little differently in terms of potential capex? i guess trying to understand if the missouri, west virginia model is one we should look at going forward.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yeah. we think very similarly as we've done before. so not -- once we address something, the money that investment that you would have to put into it is not going to be huge, but we want to make a difference just by being able to focus much more on that operation. and then, for example, the previous owner has been able to create synergy effects by introducing the property into our portfolio and eliminate certain overhead that was there, plus a lot of other smaller operational improvements that you see the property in need.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
okay. great. and just because my first one kind of fell through there. if i could ask one more on cripple creek, one of your competitors is spending an additional $180 million on kind of a higher end hotel and amenities. does that make you change your strategy there with the table game change? and potentially relook at former hotel plans for spillover traffic or whatever? or are you just going to watch everything unfold before making any strategic changes there?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
peter, if i may. for the moment, we just watch and see. we don't see a need to actually react immediately. i mean if this is happening, this is great. it will expand the market. it will certainly bring more people up to cripple creek, and that alone is good for us already. and we think that by the operating signs we have will bring us part of that additional number of guests over, even if they sleep at another property.
as you know, we have ample land available and also we have plans in the drawer that have been -- that have progressed rather well. so if one day we'll decide there is attractive upside to be gained by building our own hotel or expanding the hotel rooms that we have, we could rather quickly do so. but at the moment, it's not a priority.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
okay. fantastic. thanks, guys. great quarter again.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thanks, dave.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question here comes from chad beynon from macquarie. please state your question.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. peter, i was wondering if you could elaborate, maybe just a little bit more on the caruthersville stats. i think you said revenue per player was up 40% in the quarter. and then at the beginning, i know you mentioned higher spend per visit and more time on device. do you believe that this was an anomaly? was it just kind of a sharp peak during holiday periods in the fourth quarter? or is it something that's really showing that this property and the customers around there could continue to play at higher levels, particularly post-reopening when more people come back to the property? thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we're seeing that great performance since june, actually since we've reopened both properties in missouri. so it certainly is not a onetime thing. it wasn't a onetime thing in q4. it has been happening for over half a year now. erwin, any additional color from you?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
i can only underline what you said. we -- i mean we can't say too much, but we are -- i can say, we're really, really pleased with the numbers in caruthersville also in q1.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
okay. great. appreciate it. and then given your higher free cash flow, you guys have generated $40 million of ebitda in the back half of '20 despite some of these restrictions and closures. how are you thinking about your current lease? i know when you originally announced the acquisition, you had about 2 times coverage. are there opportunities to maybe adjust for that, take advantage of the multiples that reits are paying for this rental stream? or are you more focused on just deleveraging your conventional debt at this point?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
deleveraging is one thing that we focus on. and the other one when it comes to rent and the lease agreements we agreed. so we want to address that perhaps in connection with a new project, a new m&a situation, new acquisition that we may want to do this year. that might be the right time to address that. for now, the focus is on deleveraging and finding another good target.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
and are you still thinking that roughly 2 times coverage is the right metric to use for new deals or maybe slightly lower, but something kind of in that ballpark?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yeah, in that ballpark. we don't want to go too aggressive. i mean i'd rather be more aggressive on the cap rate, but you know us for quite some time, we have been a little bit conservative and i'd rather pay a lower total amount of rent because you never know in the next -- these are long-term agreements. you never know what's coming in the next three or five years.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
okay. great. appreciate it. congrats on the results and best of luck.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
okay. thanks, chad.

operator
welcome to the century casinos q1 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger.
mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
hello. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos erwin haitzmann as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton.
as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings, and encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including but not limited to adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investor section of our website at cnty.com. i will now provide an overview of the first quarter results. and after that, there will be a q&a session.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $14.7 million, an increase of 53% over the first quarter of last year compared to ebitda of q1 2019. results were driven almost exclusively by our properties in the u.s. because our casinos in canada were closed for the entire quarter, and in poland, they were closed for most of the quarter. without disclosures, we estimate our adjusted ebitda would have been around $22 million.
so yes, it was a great quarter. january and february were good. march was exceptional. and it is great to see that strength continuing into april and early may. as most other local and regional casinos, we are benefiting from pent-up demand. well, actually, i'm not sure if we can call it that, because that strong demand has been around since june, so almost a year now. but anyway, we are benefiting from strong demand from easing restrictions, from the vaccine rollout which is driving the older demographic back to the casinos, from strengthening consumer confidence, from the preference for close to home entertainment, and from the fiscal stimulus. all of that has improved visitation as well as spending levels with our casinos, and together with our disciplined and efficient operating strategy, contributed to these great results across our portfolio.
we are confident we can keep delivering strong performances throughout the rest of the year, especially when looking at the very important 60-plus demographic segment. that lucrative 60-plus old customer only started to return very recently, indicating more upside ahead. we've seen some growth from this demographic in march, but many was still cautious and remained on the sidelines. that is changing. and as covid vaccinations continue to rollout and restrictions lift, we expect visitation to improve further as the year progresses.
we've also benefited from new player sign-ups, especially at our three new properties in west virginia and missouri, where new sign-ups were 30% higher than in q4 2020. and the worth of these new players was even more impressive. it was 41% higher compared to the first quarter of 2019. this influx of new players is providing us the great opportunity to grow our database, identify high-value players and convert them to loyal regular visitors.
the strong revenue trajectory coupled with a substantially reduced fixed cost base translate to continued meaningful ebitda levels well ahead of 2019 benchmarks. other than the positive revenue trend, the big question is whether the high operating margins are sustainable. for the third quarter in a row, we have been able to achieve high operating margins, and yes, we do believe that will continue to be attainable. high operating margins depend on high revenues and a disciplined approach to operating costs and expenses. we believe we will see sustained margin improvement relative to 2019 levels through more efficient marketing practices, reduced labor costs, and the elimination of certain margin dilutive amenities.
savings come from many areas, including but not limited to promotions, direct mail advertising, outside hotel comps and cost of goods sold, especially in f&b. should competing operators get more aggressive with promotional activity or even start bringing back margin dilutive non-gaming amenities that have been scrapped during covid, that could have an impact on our margins. this is something we have to watch out for, but at this point, we haven't seen any significant impact in any of our markets even as other entertainment options, las vegas for example have started to come back quite strongly. this is encouraging and has continued into april and early may.
but clearly, revenue trends have the biggest impact on whether those margins will stay up or go down a little bit. and that makes us feel good as we expect a significant amount of true pent-up demand from the 60-plus demographic as mentioned. the play levels of that demographic are kicking in, as we speak and support and boost regional gaming revenue. and most importantly, the ebitda flow through should continue to be strong, as the marketing spend behind this player base is pretty limited.
let's now look at the first quarter performance of each reporting segment, starting with colorado. it was a fantastic quarter for our properties in cripple creek and central city, with both casinos clearly outpacing even pre-covid levels. net operating revenue was up 40% over 2020, and it was up 17% over 2019, in spite of capacity restrictions throughout the quarter. adjusted ebitda was up four-fold over 2020, and it was up 62% over 2019. the ebitda margin jumped to a first quarter record of 33%.
in colorado, each county has different gaming flow restrictions. in cripple creek, the full slot floor and about half of the table game positions were opened during the quarter. in central city, the casino was operating approximately two-thirds of the slot machines and half of the table game positions. our market share went up in both markets, in cripple creek from 10.6% to 12.3% and in central city from 27.4% to 30.8%.
we anticipate continued strong performances in the summer months and see further upside from two more sports betting launches and we see growth in table game revenue from new games and higher limits. so far, only one out of three sports betting partnerships is up and running. the other two plans will launch later this year. all three partnerships pay as a percentage of revenue, with a minimum guaranteed amount per year. that's without any investment or cost participation from our side. so, it flows straight to the bottom line.
moving on to missouri, which is our most important market in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation. and our two properties in cape girardeau and caruthersville, also machines are in operation, but only 54% of our table game positions are available for play. as a result, for the quarter, they're again fantastic.
net operating revenue was up 44% over 2020, and it was up 27% over 2019. adjusted ebitda was up 2.5 times over 2020, and it was up 77% over 2019. the ebitda margin jumped to a first quarter record of, listen to this, 49.7%, truly remarkable. the cape girardeau slot revenue in the quarter was the highest quarterly slot revenue in that property's history.
the month of march was a record-setting month for the property in several areas. slot revenue and total revenue were both monthly records. march also hit the highest monthly guest counts seen at the property since reopening in june. f&b cash revenue was at its highest monthly total since reopening, but i'm seeing only minimal increases in comps. table top and revenue has a lot of upside still, as we were operating at reduced capacity and with restrictions such as no eating, drinking or smoking at gaming tables.
we continue to get very good customer feedback for the new mobile app. the ad focuses on increasing customer engagement and provides guests access to all amenities and promotions with full account visibility and the ability to take advantage of rewards and offers. and for us, that means lots of opportunities to further increase customer loyalty and also save significantly on direct mail expenses. in the not too distant future, missouri could legalize online sports gaming and betting and igaming, which could bring additional revenue and ebitda upside for us in debt markets.
next is west virginia, where we operate the mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort. adjusted ebitda doubled compared to q1 2020, but was down 25% compared to 2019. this is not surprising, because of a temporary smoking ban and a curfew in ohio, where the majority of mountaineer's business comes from. currently, the gaming floor offers about 94% of the slot machines and 47% of table game positions for play.
some of the f&b outlets are open with limited hours of operation. the convention space remains closed, and the hotel is operating with limited capacity. because of its resort destination character, mountaineer usually draws quite a lot of its business from customers staying for a night or two, which was difficult in the last 12 months. but now, especially since march, we see a strong uptick in business, which we believe is directly linked to more people getting their vaccinations and feeling comfortable getting out of the house for short trips, overnight stays.
so, we've started to see first indications that the regional destination business is returning. hotel reservations have increased to the highest level in more than a year. in fact, preliminary numbers for april show ebitda exceeding 2019 numbers. these are early days still, but we may see a great come back of that property as the year progresses. and our online casino gaming has gone live in april in partnership with rush street interactive and william hill.
internationally, our operations in poland were closed for most of the quarter. we operated for a couple of weeks in march only. and the very latest news we got this morning point to an opening in early june. monthly cash flow is about $1million. as already reported, we are in talks with several parties about the sale of the polish casinos. and as of today, we can't predict the outcome of these negotiations. it takes time, but we are pretty certain that we will have a more precise update for you in our next earnings call.
and in canada, we were closed for the entire quarter. we currently anticipate reopening sometime next month, early mid-june, but that's speculation at this point in time. hospitalizations and vaccination rollouts as a percentage of the population are the key factors for reopening. vaccination distribution is gaining ground. it's about -- at 30% at least[phonetic] the first dose. the monthly cash burn is about $1.4 million[phonetic], while we are closed.
once we are allowed to reopen, we expect to realize labor efficiencies with limiting amenities to actual customer demands, which should result in increased ebitda margin. additionally, the potential licensing for online sports betting in canada could provide significant upside for us in the province of alberta, where we have four out of 28 licenses. that concludes the round-up of operations.
now a few words about our balance sheet, liquidity and outlook. as of the end of march, we had $66 million in cash and cash equivalents and $184.4 million in outstanding debt on our balance sheet, resulting in net debt of $118.4 million. the outstanding debt included $167.9 million related to the macquarie credit agreement, $9.9 million of bank debt in europe, $15.5 million related to a long-term land lease for century downs in canada and a net of $8.9 million in deferred financing costs. we are going ahead with select capex projects, mostly new slot product. other than that, all our properties are in good shape and do not need any substantial investment.
overall, our business has been remarkably strong, with almost all of our revenue coming from customers who live within a 1.5 hours drive from our properties. we have successfully executed a strategy built on our premium local customers. going forward, we will stay firmly committed to our operating strategy, driving increased ebitda as a result of continued operating discipline and a tight focus on the right customer.
even as other gaming entertainment options, in particular las vegas, are starting to come back, we believe high margins will be sustainable in the regional and local casino markets and our performances in april and early may seem to indicate that.
in terms of our online business, we continue to be excited by the opportunity presented by sports betting and igaming. it's a highly promotional and competitive landscape, but sports betting and igaming already generating positive cash flows for us. we believe our partnerships with circa sports, william hill, bet365, rush street and tipico are the right approach right now. it gives us guaranteed income without investment and also let us learn a lot about the online business.
long term, however, we may well consider entering the online space and our own brand. thereby, enhancing the multi-channel relationship with our customers. with revenue streams from land-based casinos, racetrack and racinos, on and off-track betting as well as sports betting and igaming, we are developing into a truly multi-channel north american gaming company. and we are, as we speak, seriously looking at a handful of possible acquisition opportunities, all in the u.s., to further broaden our footprint and leverage our successful operating model.
with that, we look forward to our casinos and racetracks reopening in poland and canada and to a busy summer season in north america as the pandemic hopefully subsides. on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our business during these challenging times.
i thank you for your attention and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead, please.
",":
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from david bain from b riley. please go ahead. your line is open.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
great. thank you, and congratulations on the reopening performance to date and clearly forward trends there. first, i was hoping you could help us understand the current m&a environment. specifically, you have -- given the strong reopening here, have you seen prices tightening or are they in line with what you've been reviewing previously, product or supply tightened or is it the same number of acquirers? any kind of overall view as to what's going on out there would be really helpful.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yeah. thanks, david. we compared to -- about a year ago, there are certainly fewer properties on the market. but surely, at least between half a dozen and dozen out there that are of interest to us and could very well fit into our portfolio. in terms of valuation and price levels, it is very difficult, if not unlikely that you get a deal done on the same terms that we have done our appeal over a year ago, where we actually paid, was it around four times or so. but how we look -- we go in with our people, with our teams and do due diligence and we come up with an ebitda number. ebitda that we think we can do with that property.
and based on that, we apply a market that works for us. because looking at current numbers or last year's numbers, especially these days, it's just extremely difficult. so, we try to stay away from that and come up with our own estimates and apply marketable. so, the landscape is a little bit smaller than it was a year ago, but still very attractive targets out there.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay, awesome. and this one is going to be short, so i'm hoping i can ask a brief third as well, but i think it'll be short anyway. i know it's early days. any antidote on the [indecipherable] new games in colorado under amendment 77?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
yes, this is erwin. we take a cautious approach. we have set a maximum bet at $500. and on the first half opening, we saw action going up to $500. overall, we have the feeling that it will take a little while until that market up there higher [indecipherable] not only at our base, but in general in colorado. with the exception of a few back tables here and there, no other new games have been added anywhere or at least not yet. so like i say, it's early days and i think amounting to the exercise, we will be able to say something more definitive.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay, great. and this is the final one, promise. if canada reopens, are there any different dynamics to think about versus your strong u.s. reopening? i assume we don't know capacity restrictions out of the gate, things like that, but our drivers generally align from both the structural margin and overall reopening similar to the u.s. or is there anything else that we should think about in canada, if that reopens?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
i think we'll see the u.s. openings kind of mirror. we will again be cautious with the site offerings everything other than the non-gaming offerings and [indecipherable] cost and ebitda conscious. we think that we'll definitely do really pent-up demand and we would hope that if and when we are permitted to open that we can produce interesting numbers right from the get go. just as [indecipherable] mentioned, as much of a hindrance as it basically can, if we have a limitation on slot machines, it may -- we have seen in some markets that even if we had a few restrictions here or there, we could still produce fantastic numbers simply because the people were playing longer and more.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
awesome. okay. thanks so much guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chad beynon from macquarie. please state your question.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question and congrats on nice quarterly results. i know you mentioned that poland is kind of influx here, the talks are still ongoing. you mentioned that the property is due to open actually this week. after we start to -- i guess, the first question, should we expect that the demand comes back quickly? can you remind us in terms of what restrictions would be when that opens up? and then once it's open and kind of running normally, should that propel the discussions that you're having in terms of divesting the property? thank you.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
when we [indecipherable] that was up until last night or mid night or so. they told us that we will most likely be allowed to open tomorrow, but then, this morning, they changed it and postponed it for another four weeks. so it is early june now. once we are allowed to reopen, we do expect that especially in the casinos outside of warsaw, which are truly local and regional casinos that there will be a lot of pent-up demand and that will translate into revenue and ebitda right away from the get-go. the casinos in warsaw have traditionally also drawn from international business travelers and that's about between 20% and 30% of the business there in the warsaw casinos and that may not come back as quickly as the local business. erwin, would you like to add?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, i agree with what you say. and with regards to the question of which restrictions we expect, it's hard to say. we really don't know. maybe there will still be an obligation to wear a mask, but we don't. if we had to guess, then we would say nothing other than that, but it's speculation, we don't know.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just on a potential change in your online strategy, is this something that would come with a lot of additional costs, whether it's technology or if you decide to pivot to this strategy, would you use third-party companies to kind of help with the sales, the marketing, the technology, all of that limiting your expenses, but just connecting from a b2c standpoint and getting those revenues? thank you.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
this is erwin. going in, we will definitely start with a third-party partner and model in such a fashion that we keep ourselves flexible and possibly as we become more comfortable and get wiser in that space that we might replace step-by-step various services and take them in-house. but that would clearly be revenue and ebitda-driven.
chad beynon -- macquarie -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
thank you, chad.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from jeff stantial from stifel. please state your question.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning everyone. thanks for taking our questions and congrats. really nice quarter. i wanted to start on your missouri properties. results coming on the market just truly incredible, those two assets are run rating about $60 million of ebitda, which if my math is right here, it is over double what they were generating before you acquired them. margins played a big role. you cited close to 50%, but topline has also been impressive.
so i guess my question is this, if you think about some of the short-term tailwind versus the long-term structural changes that you've made to the business both in reaction to covid-19 as well as -- as you took those assets over from prior ownerships, how do you see those assets, sort of, i guess, quote-unquote normalizing out over the course of the year and into 2022?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
we -- this is erwin. we think they are pretty normal now. we don't think that there is much more normalization going on with regard to the numbers. we are very optimistic that we can keep the numbers that we have now.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay, well, that's incredible. great, thanks. thanks a lot. and then for my follow-up, you talked to a number of player sign-ups during the quarter. i think it's up 30% versus 2019 if my memory serves. i was hoping to unpack that a bit and see if there are any overarching characteristics for these new players coming into the database, do they tend to skew much younger, what parts of the gaming floor and the broader casino do they gravitate to? anything to help understand that new player base would be great.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
i would say, the upper 50% of the purchasing power of our visitors, so the more affluent customers, demographic is pretty much the [indecipherable]
something like an indication.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay, great. and then along those lines, just how those fared i think that was during the quarter, just how does that -- how does that progressed as the quarter played out, and how is that kind of paced into april and early march just in terms of new sign-ups, still seeing similar levels of strength versus 2019?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
you mean april and early may, right. yeah, still seeing strength.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay, perfect. that's great. thanks for all the color and congrats again. really strong quarter, guys.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thanks, jeff.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer

operator
welcome to the century casinos' q2 2021 earnings conference call.
this call will be recorded. [operator instructions]
i would like to introduce your host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-ceo & president
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann; as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton.
as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statement. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of various risk factors in our sec filings and encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filings available in the investor section of our website at cnty.com. i will now provide an overview of the second quarter results and after that there will be a q&a session.
the second quarter was an outstanding performance for our company and our entire team. our focused operating strategy produced strong and robust margins, and we generated the highest quarterly ebitda in the history of our company. we're happy to report $92.2 million of revenue and $25.2 million of adjusted ebitda. again, this is a new quarterly record for century casinos. on a consolidated basis, ebitda margin in the quarter was 27.4%. all these numbers are substantially better than what the street expected.
the quarter showed continued strength and momentum across all our local and regional properties and businesses. the results were driven almost exclusively by our properties in the u.s. because our casinos in poland and canada were closed for most of the quarter. they have reopened in late may and early june, respectively, and have been profitable since day one. at most other local and regional casinos, we continued to benefit from strong demand from the strong preference for close-to-home entertainment and from the fiscal stimulus. all that has improved visitation as well as spending levels at our casinos, and together with our disciplined and efficient operating strategy contributed to these great results across our portfolio.
our cost structure is more streamlined, and our marketing and promotional investments are more targeted, which translates into increased spend per visit, especially from our most valuable players. and it's very good to see that strong operating performance from the first half of the year also continuing into july. we realize there's a bit more uncertainty today about the pandemic, but we are still confident in our ability to generate results well above pre-covid levels as we continue to successfully execute our operating philosophy with a tight focus on the right customer.
our business is largely gaming centric, only a minority of our revenue is coming from non-gaming amenities, and many of those are opened on a limited basis only, and that results in an overall lower cost structure. we will only open more non-gaming amenities or expand the opening hours as demand picks up further, so that should grow in a profitable way. at this point, we haven't seen any significant impact of more aggressive marketing from our competitors even as other entertainment options, las vegas for example, have started to come back quite strongly. that's very encouraging and that as well has continued into july.
beyond the ongoing strength and growth our core properties are delivering, we continue to pursue initiatives to improve and expand our businesses further. we are developing into a multi-channel gaming company with six traditional casinos in colorado, missouri and in canada, with three racetrack and casino resorts in west virginia and canada, and a variety of operations and partnerships in off-track betting, sports betting and igaming.
while the traditional casino table and slot games still account for the vast majority of our revenue, the revenue from igaming, sports betting and pari-mutuel betting has, for the first time, surpassed the revenue generated from our hotels or f&b operations, and has become the second highest revenue generator for us. and that comes, as you know, without any significant investment from our side whatsoever.
during the quarter, our operating partners rush street and william hill launched igaming in west virginia under our master license. and the second of our three colorado sports betting partnerships plans to go live next month. but while digital gaming is an attractive way to grow our company, we see even more upside by reinvesting into our existing casino assets.
one of these opportunities is our casino in caruthersville in missouri, which has been a very strong performer in our regional portfolio. we are currently in the planning phase of developing a land-based casino and hotel facility at caruthersville, which will significantly enhance the guest experience and expand the reach and catchment area of that property. as soon as we firmed up the plans and capex numbers, we'll provide more detailed information about this exciting project.
now, a quick look at our balance sheet and liquidity. as a result of our strong operating performance and careful management of capex, we are in a much stronger financial position today than pre-covid. net cash provided by operating activities was $7.5 million in the quarter, based on $25.2 million of adjusted ebitda, that's a conversion rate of 69%. that rate is driven in part by regulatory regimes in west virginia and alberta canada where the regulatory bodies pay for half to almost all of the slot machine and related capex.
the strength of our operating performance led our current cash position increase to $72 million, that's end of june. with outstanding debt of $184 million, our net debt sits at $112 million as of june 30. based on trailing 12 months, the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is healthy 2.0. we have a well maintained asset base that requires minimal levels of maintenance capex to sustain current levels of profitability. and we have no substantial debt maturities before 2026.
i'll now take a quick look at the performance of each operating segment starting with colorado. as you see -- as you've seen, it was an excellent quarter for our properties in cripple creek and central city. both casinos clearly outpaced even pre-covid levels. the biggest difference is that our better players spend considerably more time on our slots and tables than before. net operating revenue was up 37% over q2 '19, and it was up 29% over the first quarter of this year.
adjusted ebitda more than doubled compared to q2 '19, and it was up 55% over the first quarter of this year. and the ebitda margin jumped to a second quarter record of 40%. on may 1st, table limits in colorado increased and additional table games such as baccarat were allowed. as a result, the drop at our gaming tables was up over 30% compared to 2019.
moving on to missouri, our most important market in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation. and again, the results for the quarter were fantastic. coining volumes on the slots and drop at the gaming tables continued to be at historically high levels. net operating revenue was up 48% over q2 2019, and was up 11% over the first quarter of this year. and adjusted ebitda more than doubled compared to q2 '19, and it was up 12% over the first quarter of this year. ebitda margin in the second quarter, 50%, truly remarkable.
marketing spend continues to remain significantly below pre-covid levels, and it's expected to continue at its current run rate moving forward. the reductions that we made in advertising, direct mail and promotional expense appears to be sustainable and has not had any negative impact on gaming volumes.
a couple of weeks ago, we have announced a pretty important breakthrough in missouri with the change of a missouri law that require each casino to be a floating facility. going forward, the missouri gaming commission will have the ability to approve a casino facility as long as it is located within 1,000 feet of the mississippi or missouri rivers and includes a container with at least 2,000 gallons of water beneath the facility. this change opens the opportunity for our property in caruthersville, which by the way is the last remaining riverboat casino on open water in missouri, to move to a non-floating facility.
and in preparation for that, we purchased some parcels of land and a small existing two-story hotel. these land purchases provide strategic options for the future casino and hotel development and better access to parking. we have already started working with architects to develop plans for the new casino and hotel facility. that will be a very exciting development with a target roi of over 20%.
next is west virginia where we operate the mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort. net operating revenue was down 6% over q2 '19, but it was up 28% over the first quarter of this year. adjusted ebitda increased by 5% over q2 '19, and it was up 72% over the first quarter of this year. these are very good results, especially because a temporary smoking ban was in place for the first part of the quarter and we had to pre-screen and take the temperature of all guests until the middle of the quarter. it was only two weeks before the end of the quarter that the covid restrictions were lifted.
the f&b outlets are open with limited hours of operation, the convention space remains closed and hotel is operating with limited capacity. because of its resort destination character, mountaineer usually draws quite a lot of its business from customers staying for a night or two, which was challenging in the last 12 months. but now for the last couple of months, we have seen strong uptick in business, which we believe is directly linked to more people getting their vaccinations and feeling comfortable getting out of the house for short trips and overnight stays. we started to see indications that the regional destination business is returning. hotel reservations have increased to the highest level in more than a year.
internationally, our operations in poland were closed for most of the quarter. we reopened at the end of may. business has been very strong since day one with adjusted ebitda averaging between $700,000 and $1 million per month. as reported, we are in talks with several parties about the sale of our polish casinos. three companies are on the short list and detailed negotiations with them are ongoing. we are getting closer, but it's too early to predict the outcome of these negotiations.
and in canada, we were also closed for most of the quarter. we were allowed to reopen on june 10. for the first three weeks, we operated with restrictions including a 25% occupancy capacity, social distancing protocols and mandatory mask requirements. on july 1, the alberta government relaxed covid restrictions provincewide. eliminating caps occupancy, social distancing and the mask requirement. and again, there was strong demand from day one after reopening, and coupled with labor efficiencies, we are seeing increased ebitda margins throughout our canadian properties.
in canada, we also look forward to the arrival of online sports betting, which could provide significant upside for us in the province of alberta, where we have four out of 28 licenses. that finishes the roundup of our operations.
in conclusion, i'd like to say that the second quarter was another remarkable performance for our company and our entire team. our nationwide portfolio continues to generate robust levels of ebitda, and our operating strategy and tight focus on the right customer are producing the highest margins in our history. and we do believe that our strong performances since reopening are largely sustainable.
with almost all of our revenue coming from customers who live within a 1.5 hours drive from our properties, we have successfully executed a strategy built on our premium local customers. we stay firmly committed to our operating strategy, driving increased ebitda as a result of a continued operating discipline and a tight focus on the right customer.
looking forward, the trends we saw across our businesses in the first and second quarters are continuing into july and early august. in fact, some of our canadian casinos set all-time coining records in july. and finally, we are looking at a handful of possible acquisition opportunities, all in the u.s. to further broaden our footprint and leverage our successful operating model.
on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our businesses through these challenging times.
i thank you for your attention, and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead, please.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of david bain with b. riley.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
great. very nice results and exciting opportunity in caruthersville. i guess, first, maybe you could speak a little bit more to the m&a dynamic in the current environment, just assuming price creep out there, is it still overall rational in your view? are you seeing supply levels where you feel you can still do one acquisition a year as a goal including this year?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-ceo & president
thanks, dave. yes, the m&a landscape is a little bit more quiet compared to a couple of years ago, but there are some interesting targets out there. obviously, the big question is valuation. and it's -- that's really the one and only focus point. the targets are out there, and they're interesting, and they would also provide great upside for us and fit very well into our portfolio. to do one acquisition every 12 to 18 months is absolutely still our goal.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. great. got you. so i have a couple more, but i know we're limited to two. i'm going to -- i'll go with colorado. i mean, looking at the early results post amendment 77, the same trends that you cited, we've seen some capacity announcements in that market. do you plan on reassessing the previous hotel room expansion or any other opportunities in colorado to expand?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-ceo & president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
at this point, we are not -- we don't think of going back to expanding our hotel capacity. in particular, in cripple creek, we think we would like to see how the competition is doing with their expansion first. but what we do in cripple creek is something different, we're building employee housing, which will be ready sometime in first half of 2022. and we think that will give us a good competitive edge over others because employment, obviously, is a huge topic.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay, great. very nice results again. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of jeff stantial with stifel.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions and congrats on a nice set of results here. i want to just follow, erwin, your comments on the labor market. i wanted to kind of drill in a little bit more here. aside from colorado, which i think has been historically a pretty tight labor market, are you having issues hiring across any of your other markets? and if so, how should we think about the dynamic relative to the margin profile you've been running over the past several quarters?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
we experienced some pressure like everybody in the industry but it's manageable. and we don't think that it will -- whatever we do will have any significant impact on our results going forward.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
perfect. very helpful. drilling into the margin profile a bit more here. you talked to a demand-based decision to bring back some non-gaming amenities back online over time. do you still expect certain amenities to stay out of the business permanently? what are you hearing from customers here? are they fairly agnostic to things like buffets coming back or is the expectation that all those, call it, loss leader amenities come back once covid is fully in the rearview mirror?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
i think in very short growth we feel that our customers are happy with what we are offering them now, even if it is significantly less than it used to be pre-covid. and that is an interesting phenomenon to see. we don't see any pressure, for example, to come up with the buffet. keep in mind, a reminder also that buffet may be very important for vegas, it's a completely different situation in a low cost market.
jeff stantial -- stifel -- analyst
perfect. that's all from me. i'll pass it on. appreciate all the colors, guys.
operator
[operator instructions] and your next question comes from the line of chad beynon with macquarie.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is jordan bender on for chad. i just want to revisit colorado for a second here. and in terms of the max bet, are you starting to see people come to the market that might have been going to other markets where they weren't limited on their bets or are you really just seeing kind of your core customers just spending more at the machines or tables?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
yes. on tables, i think you're mainly referring to, i would assume...
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
yes. sorry.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
yes. no, sure. we see a couple of new customers coming in. but i should also say that we have taken a conservative type of [phonetic] approach with regard to the maximum bets that we offer. we don't want to expose our casinos to the risk of higher fluctuation. some other casinos take, not all of them successfully. we decided to go slow and step by step. it is also a question of the training of our own staff. it's better to give them a chance to get used better to the higher limit. and we have an increase, which is healthy, and we think there is more to go. having said that, particularly in the denver meaning black hawk, central city market, we do not think that we can and would like to compete with the large market participants there.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
awesome. and then in terms of mountaineer, you kind of talked about how the covid restrictions impacted results in the quarter and the margin expansion you're seeing there isn't quite up to what you're seeing in terms of the basis point growth versus your other markets. as the restrictions kind of loosen there, do you expect to start to see that market grow margin a little bit more i guess the upside is proportional to your other u.s. assets?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
i didn't hear the first part of our question. which market are you asking about?
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
west virginia.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board, co-ceo
in west virginia, as peter mentioned earlier, we have a -- obviously, the situation there is that we also -- our customers are to quite an extent also coming from the neighboring states. and so whatever happens there is also impactful or maybe impactful to our casinos. we have been burdened by covid restrictions up until quite late in the quarter where everything has been -- when the restrictions have gone. and since then, we see our volumes really shooting up. and we are -- again, as peter said, july looks very friendly and very positive. so we see more -- we think it's very well possible that we also can exceed pre-covid levels rather quickly. and again, with regard to the mix of what we offer in addition to the pure gaming, people seem to be happy with what they find.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
awesome. nice results, and thank you.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-ceo & president
thank you, jordan.

operator
welcome to century casinos q3 2021 earnings conference call. this call will be recorded. [operator instructions]
i would like to introduce our host for today, mr. peter hoetzinger. please begin, sir.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann; as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton.
as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. we undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings and encourage you to review these filings.
in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investors section of our website at cnty.com.
i will now provide an overview of the third quarter results. after that, there will be a question-and-answer session. our results for the third quarter have been truly outstanding. revenues exceeded the third quarter of last year by 22%, and they doubled compared to 2019. at $117 million, we set a new all-time revenue record for the second consecutive quarter. very strong flow-through and a consolidated margin of 28% result in adjusted ebitda of $33.1 million for the quarter, also a new all-time record for our company. that is 49% higher than the ebitda of q3 of last year. sequentially, it is 31% higher than the ebitda of the second quarter of this year.
considering yesterday's reaction in the stock market, let me point out that our sequential revenue and ebitda growth of 27% and 31%, respectively, are some of the largest, if not the largest, improvements of q3 over q2 numbers of any listed gaming company. and on top of that, we also generated sequential margin improvement. our ebitda margin in q3 was 95 points higher than our margin was in q2. and one more thing. sports betting and igaming is profitable for us, and it has been profitable for us since day one.
all right now, let's move on. our grade q3 performance is the result of a disciplined cost-focused operating philosophy and effective targeted marketing to our high-value customers. the quarter showed continued strength and momentum across all our local and regional properties and businesses. we saw impressive growth with increased visitation, more time on device and higher spend per visit across our database and across our markets. we continue to benefit from strong regional demand and the preference for close to home entertainment.
all of that has improved visitation as well as spending levels in our casinos, and together with our disciplined and efficient operating strategy contributed to these great results across our portfolio. our cost structure is more streamlined, and our marketing and promotional investments are more targeted, which translates into increased spend per visit, especially from our most valuable players. we achieved the record operating results and margins despite some pressure from a challenging labor market and other cost inflation resulting from supply chain disruptions.
our local management teams are doing a great job dealing with inflationary pressures, whether it be on cost of goods or wage inflation, and we are not seeing it having a meaningful impact on margins. on our busy weekends, we have been able to manage the labor shortages and operate the hotels and f&b outlets at full capacity. during the week, however, due to labor shortages, we had to operate some of our hotels below the available room capacity. and as a result, we have not always been able to accommodate all waited customers. but as the labor market normalizes, we will be able to bring more hotel rooms online, driving even more gaming revenue growth from these customer segments.
our business is largely gaming centric. only a minority of our revenue is coming from non-gaming amenities, resulting in an overall lower cost structure. we will only open more non-gaming amenities or expand their opening hours as demand picks up further, so that should grow in a profitable way. with regard to the sustainability of our high operating margins. at this point, we haven't seen any significant impact of more aggressive marketing from our competitors, even as other entertainment options, las vegas, for example, have started to come back quite strongly. that environment hasn't really changed over the last quarter or two. most of our competitors are being disciplined and maintain their attention to cost control.
we will continue focusing on the right customer, enhancing customer convenience, building loyalty, streamlining processes and reinforcing our operating efficiency through new initiatives and technology. a great example of that is our mobile application, the winters' zone app. with that app, we can send exclusive offers that are targeted by tier, location, date of the last visit, etc., etc., to our customers. it displays direct messages, up-to-date promotional information, current tier level and benefits, current point balance as well as the value of those points, the amenities at the property, the number of entries or drawings and current offers. the app is already live in missouri and west virginia with great success, and will be rolled out in colorado shortly.
it provides great convenience for our customers. and for us, it brings lots of opportunities to further increase customer loyalty, and it also saves significantly on direct mail and related expenses. revenue from igaming and sports betting and pari-mutuel betting continues at a strong pace. as you know, we have partnered with experienced companies to run these operations without any significant investment from our side whatsoever. that may limit the upside potential in a very optimistic scenario, but we believe this approach is the prudent one for us, at least currently, proving an efficient use of our capital. beyond these digital initiatives, we are also excited about additional growth opportunities available throughout our operations, most notably in missouri. more about that in the missouri segment shortly.
let's now cover our balance sheet and liquidity. today, we are financially a much stronger company than at any point in our history. net leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times, and it's expected to further decline by year-end. the strength of our operating performance increased our current cash position to over $100 million. with outstanding debt of just $182 million, our net debt sits at $81 million as of september 30. we have a well maintained asset base that requires minimal levels of maintenance capex to sustain the current levels of profitability. and we have no substantial debt maturities before 2026.
next, a brief summary of the performance of each operating segment, starting with colorado. it was an excellent quarter for our properties in cripple creek and central city, with both casinos clearly surpassing 2019 and 2020 levels. net operating revenue was up 36% over '19 and was up 20% over last year. adjusted ebitda more than doubled compared to '19 and is up -- it was up 4% over last year. the ebitda margin remained very strong at 40%. the combined market share of our central city and cripple creek properties increased by 350 points. to further solidify and strengthen our competitive position in cripple creek, we have decided to provide high-quality employee housing. we will build housing for up to 30 of our current and future employees and expect to have the apartments ready by september of next year.
moving on to missouri, our most important market in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation. again, great results for the quarter. july had one of the highest monthly tailor drops in property history, led by strong mini baccara volumes and july and september set monthly coin in records for those months. net operating revenue was up 24% over q3 of last year, and adjusted ebitda increased by 38%. the ebitda margin was 45%, even though, the increased wages on top of the hourly minimum in order to stay competitive in the southeast missouri areas and help attract and retain high quality team members.
marketing spend continues to remain significantly below pre-covid levels, and is expected to continue at its current run rate. reductions in advertising, direct mail and promotional expenses appear to be sustainable and have not had any negative impact on gaming volumes. we've announced two important developments at our missouri properties. we plan to bring the caruthersville casino, which is the last remaining riverboat casino and open water in missouri on land to a non-floating facility, and we plan to build a hotel at our property in cape girardeau.
in caruthersville, the new facility will include a newly designed casino with approximately 20% more gaming positions and 75 hotel rooms in total. the new development will provide significant operational efficiencies as well as significantly more convenience for our customers. it will increase the catchment area and also give us a chance to win back customers who didn't like the riverboat style when they paid us the first visit. in cape girardeau, we will develop a nine story, 75 room hotel building. that will be single-loaded so that all hotel rooms will have scenic views of beautiful cape girardeau and the mississippi river, including the iconic bill emerson memorial bridge.
with that hotel development, century casino cape girardeau will transformed to a full resort destination, providing ample reasons for individual and group multi-day visits for gaming, dining, conferences, concerts, events and more. total capex will run at about eur68 million for both projects. in terms of timing, we don't have clear visibility yet, but we aim for openings in late 2023 or early 2024.
next is west virginia, where we operate the mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort. net operating revenue was up 12%, and adjusted ebitda was up 23% over the third quarter of last year. these are really great results, especially because of mountaineer resort destination character. it usually draws quite a lot of its business from hotel space, which were somehow limited -- somewhat limited due to staffing challenges and other restrictions. same with f&b outlets, they are open, but with limited hours of operation. the convention space remains closed. and on top of all that, we increased wages in july. so considering all these factors, a 23% uptick in ebitda is really exciting, and we have high hopes for a strong finish to the year.
internationally, our operations in poland generated solid numbers. adjusted ebitda was just under $3 million for the quarter, fueled by a strong performance of the casinos outside the capital city of warsaw. we do, however, expect the warsaw casinos to come back quite strongly in q4 with international tourist business and convention business just starting. and in canada, we operate with restrictions, all guests need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative covid test taken in a maximum of 72 hours before entry. also, everybody is required to wear a facemask. despite those challenges, net operating revenue almost reached 2019 levels and adjusted ebitda surpassed 2019 results by 56%. all properties contributed to that ebitda growth, and i'm happy to report that the increase was highest at century mile racetrack and casino. that finishes the roundup of operations.
we are very optimistic going forward as the recent trends have continued relatively consistently into the fourth quarter, and we expect a significant portion of the cost savings to prove permanent. with multiple avenues for continued growth as well as confidence that this level of performance is sustainable and that we will maintain much of the margin improvements we have achieved over the last 12 to 18 months. as the pandemic continues to fade, additional visitors will return to our properties. and as the labor market normalizes, we will be able to bring more hotel rooms and other amenities online, increasing our capacity to host profitable customers, thus increasing our revenue opportunities.
in conclusion, the third quarter was another remarkable performance of our company and our entire team. our entire portfolio continues to generate robust ebitda growth and our operating strategy and tight focus on the right customer are producing the highest margins in our history. on the m&a front, we are looking at a handful of possible acquisition opportunities, all in the us to further broaden our footprint and leverage our successful operating model. we've always been strategic and value-oriented when pursuing acquisitions, and that will not change. with that discipline and our strong balance sheet, we are confident to find opportunities to deploy capital in a manner that consistently build shareholder value.
on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our businesses during these challenging times.
thank you for your attention, and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead, please.

[operator instructions] your first question is from jeffrey stantial.
jeffrey stantial -- stifel -- analyst
hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a nice set of results here. for my first question, we talked a lot this earnings cycle about trends here in the us, so wanted to focus on the international ops for a second, can you talk a bit about the month-by-month cadence of performance for canada and poland? has it been fairly stable since their respective reopenings? have you witnessed any acceleration or deceleration? just curious to hear your thoughts there.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
pretty stable right, erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
yes, pretty stable and very much in line with the various measures. so when we -- as peter mentioned before, in canada, we still have -- for a long time still have restrictions. people have to wear a mask or produce a test for vaccination. that, of course, limits the speed of growth and the acceleration a little bit. however, we have also seen that across -- say international, both in poland and in canada, people are getting used to wearing -- that were being vaccinated to wearing a mask also have to do a test. and more and more people have been vaccinated in the various jurisdictions, which also means that customers that may have been hesitant to visit us now feel safe and then visit us more frequently and stay longer.
so all-in-all, we can say that we see growth everywhere with the only exception that the one or the other covid restriction limits that growth -- the speed of the growth a little bit.
jeffrey stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then for my follow-up, peter, any update you can provide on the poland sale? and then on the m&a environment, you've talked about in the us, how does seller expectations feel relative to kind of we're not focused by q2 earnings? and that's all for me, thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
in poland, the sales process continues, it runs, but it runs quite slowly. several parties are showing interest on an on and off basis. but we are finding a way, these operations are pretty valuable. they produce nice results. and overall, they're getting like smaller and smaller relatively because they are now about 9% or less than 9% of our consolidated ebitda. so that's the situation there.
and on the m&a front in the us, i think it's slowly starting. i mean you've heard, tom rigg [phonetic] saying that they are interested to sell. it's starting always in vegas. i mean, mgm is selling mirage. so it's starting. and yes, in terms of valuation, you can talk about markets all day long. it always depends on -- you apply to which ebitda do you apply. so it's a combination of finding a right multiple and agreeing on an ebitda to apply it to. but we see slowly but surely more and more properties becoming available.
jeffrey stantial -- stifel -- analyst
okay, correct. very helpful. thank you both. i'll pass it on.
operator
your next question is from david bain.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
great. thank you. very nice quarter. a lot of the big questions were addressed, but maybe we can drill down a little bit on the m&a environment that, peter, you were just speaking to. understanding valuations tightened a little bit, and you've always been sensitive on that front. it seems like through earnings season, the larger companies, you mentioned one of them have been increasingly focused on sort of the virtual gaming world and spending larger amounts there. i mean, could that open up baskets of sellers more? are you hearing of new product potential? it sounds like you were to that end? could we see property baskets? i know you were looking at, i believe, $15 million up to maybe $60 million of ebitda. but given your cash accumulation and some of the larger ones potentially looking to loosen their portfolios a little bit, could we punch through that at the right price? or are you not seeing that type of product at this point?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes, we're starting to see that, absolutely. and yes, the online business does play a role because, surely, most of the larger companies with a large footprint throughout the us, they want to have at least one property in a state to secure an online license in that state. but should they have more than one in the state, then yes, more likely, some of those will become available. yes. and so this is what we are seeing from pretty much all of the larger companies.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. great. and then i know this was somewhat addressed as well, but maybe just kind of reiterating or drilling down on canada because that was a nice outperformance versus what we were anticipating. maybe looking at the us reopening, is this sort of that reincarnated? and are you seeing anything that would give you the sense that we wouldn't expect those same sort of tailwinds to be sustained like they have here? and maybe just a tad on energy prices for the portfolio in general, both domestic and in canada of that is something that's on the radar is that typically not something that historically has caused too much volatility?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
yes. i think i guess i tried to say earlier, further growth will be fueled by easing the covid restrictions, which obviously is not our hands and is a function of the development of the numbers there. but that means upside potential because we would really think that these restrictions should be there forever. and so we feel very good about canada and the growth potential that it has and that we will be able to realize as soon as restrictions are gone.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
and anything on energy prices there or in the us?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
that does not affect -- in canada, that doesn't affect us significantly.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
okay. all right. well, great quarter again. thank you very much.
operator
your next question is from kenneth evanovich [phonetic].
kenneth evanovich -- analyst
great quarter. i would like to just -- i think most of the question was answered, but i was wondering if you could put a percentage basis on the amount that social distancing still can restrict your ability to earn full amounts of money on all your casinos. do you have a possible percentage that the business would increase if this was all gone?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
good one. erwin, do you have anything to add?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
i have numbers in mind, but i think it's problematic to speculate on that. it's really hard to say. i mean, one way to look at it is looking at our pre-covid levels, and that's -- we look at it, the first goal is to kind of revenue-wise, to compare it to the pre-covid levels and then creating to surpass them. and at the same time, with the cost control that is already in place, keep the ebitda and ebitda margins.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
and also at some of our casinos, we do not have all table gate positions open, which on a busy weekend has a negative effect. yes, but we do not have a detailed answer in terms of percentages here.
kenneth evanovich -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question is from colin o'donnell [phonetic].
colin o'donnell -- analyst
hi guys. thank you for taking my questions. a few weeks ago, one of your competitors, boyd, provided an interesting statistic, and i don't know if you guys could do the same thing. but they said their labor force had been about 24,000 before covid, and it was now about 14,000, and they expected that only 1,000 or 2,000 people would have to come back to run the casinos at a full pace. do you guys have any -- could you provide any similar type of information just so we can think about the fixed cost structure of the casinos into next year?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
no. we don't have that off-hand, we could try to get it to you later.
colin o'donnell -- analyst
yes. okay. i think that would be very helpful. and just the other thing, just looking at -- i know you guys don't have very many sellside analysts, but the street estimate on factset for this year is $66 million and for next year, it's $88 million. and i'm looking at your numbers, so you guys have done $91 million of ebitda in the last 12 months. so what -- is there something missing on the street or the communication? or it seems like you guys are going to blow the numbers out of the water, and i'm just trying to figure out if i'm missing something.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes. no, i think they wanted to be conservative. i'm sure they will update their numbers after this quarter. but other than that, colin, we don't give guidance. so it's...
colin o'donnell -- analyst
understood. but is there any significant reason that colorado or missouri or west virginia would have a worse year in next year than this year?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
no, we don't see any significant reason there.
colin o'donnell -- analyst
okay. very helpful.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
we think there's still upside.
colin o'donnell -- analyst
great. okay. well thank you for taking my question.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
thank you.
operator
your next question is from chad beynon.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
good morning. this is jordan bender on for chad today. as you look at m&a, would you look to use or continue to use a reit to possibly go bigger? and i guess what would your optimal opco/propco structure look like? and where would you want to bring leverage?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes. our goal is to grow, not only in absolute revenue and ebitda numbers, but also in property size, yes. and with regard to propco/opco, currently, we have three in the us that we acquired from eldorado resorts on an opco, two in colorado is propco, most in canada is also owned by us. so that's a good mix. and we can -- we don't have like a clear goal that we don't go below a certain percentage. so i think we could easily add another opco or also a holdco, we're fine either way. we do not need to own the asset, but feel comfortable owning some. it's really more on an opportunistic basis. for us, it's more important how we like the asset, how we like the market, the competitive environment, the regulatory environment, the specific location asset. those are the things that are far more important to us than whether we can buy the holdco or the opco.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then obviously, poland outperformed, i guess, at least our expectations in the quarter, revenues were actually over 2019 levels. you talked about that your consumers outside of warsaw were the ones that kind of outperformed in the quarter. can you kind of talk about where the casinos within warsaw sit, just kind of thinking about how the model of this segment looking into '22?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
yes please, erwin.
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
no, ok. it is totally fine.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
there is two in warsaw at american hilton hotel and the others are outside of the country. and historically, the warsaw market is -- in absolute numbers much stronger than the six outside of warsaw combined. so any uptick of the warsaw properties has a meaningful impact on the overall poland numbers. erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer
right. and if i may -- i think and if i may add to that. we -- looking at what is happening in the first quarter, we are very optimistic in that direction. we see that the business customers coming back, the marriott and hilton both getting much higher occupancy and also guest that want to come to our casinos. so we're confident that in the next phase, so to speak, the warsaw casinos will follow the same trend as the casinos on the country side.
jordan bender -- macquarie -- analyst
awesome. nice quarter. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question is from daniel wayne.
daniel wayne -- gam investments -- analyst
hi, guys, nice quarter. i was just wondering if there's any update on the poland strategic review process. is the company sort of committing to the region at this point? or any discussions there?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman of the board, co-chief executive officer and president
we have said that poland has become a non-core operation for us. it is, as i've mentioned, about 9% or less than 9% of our consolidated ebitda. and consists of eight small operations. so while it is generating very solid ebitda and cash flow for us and very high returns on our investment, we strategically do not have poland in our long-term plans, if we get a good offer. so in other words, it has great value for us. if we get that value, then yes, we decide to dispose of it, if not, we are happy keeping it.
operator
at this time, there are no further questions.

operator
welcome to century casinos q4 2021 earnings conference call. this call is being recorded [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce our host for today's call, peter hoetzinger. mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are; my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann; as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton. as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ material -- from -- materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings, and we encourage you to review this filings. in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filing available in the investors section of our website at cnty.com. i will now provide an overview of the results of the fourth quarter and after that there will be a question-and-answer session.
our fourth quarter results continued the streak of record breaking performances that we have shown throughout the year. revenues exceeded the same period of last year by 27%. adjusted ebitda was 36% higher. most of the ebitda growth came from our casinos in the u.s., but also from poland.
despite our record performance, it could have been even better. canada had a difficult quarter, because proof of vaccination was required to enter the casinos. and we were not allowed to serve liquor after 11pm, which slow traffic down significantly. thankfully, these restrictions have now been lifted and we are already seeing a nice rebound.
our [inaudible] operations are also impacted by the omicron variant, a covid related restrictions, as well as some supply and labor shortages. but our team successfully navigated through all of that, and delivered great results. our strong performance is the result of a disciplined operating philosophy and effective targeted marketing to our high value customers. our cost structure is more streamlined, and our marketing and promotional investments are more targeted, which translates into increased spent per visit, especially from our most valuable players.
the promotional environment in all our markets remains disciplined and rational, and while labor is tight in some markets, it's been able to maintain our high standards of guest experience. obviously, this is largely a gaming centric only a minority of our revenue is coming from non-gaming amenities, and it will only open more non-gaming amenities or expand their opening hours as demand picks up further so that it grows in a profitable way. the geographic diversity of our portfolio with locations in hyperlocal drive to markets with a loyal customer base has proven extremely resilient in light of the pandemic. we will continue focusing on the right customer, enhancing customer convenience, building loyalty, streamlining processes and reinforcing our operating efficiency, through new initiatives and technology.
sports betting and igaming, both are profitable for us and has been profitable for us since day one. early on, we decided not to participate in the costly [inaudible] for customers at market share. we took a similar investment in zero-risk approach, meaning we simply provide our license to specialized sports betting companies. they pay us a revenue share with a minimum annual guarantee.
and what we get from them goes straight to our bottom line, we have no cost against it. our two properties in colorado, cripple creek and central city, increased ebitda by 14%. the ebitda margin was 35%. two out of the three sports betting licenses we have in colorado are in operation already.
the third one with bet365 as a partner, is anticipated to go live next quarter. in missouri, which is our most important pocket in terms of ebitda and cash flow generation, we grew ebitda by 23%. the ebitda margin increased from 42% to 45%, even though we increase in wages, on top of the hourly minimum wage to stay competitive in the southeast missouri area and help attract and retain high quality team members. marketing spend continues to remain significantly below pre-covid levels, and is expected to continue -- to continue at its current run rate moving forward.
reductions in advertising, direct mail and promotional expenses, it appeared to be sustained and have not had any negative impact on gaming volumes. we have announced two important developments with our missouri properties. we plan to bring the caruthersville casino, which is the last remaining riverboat casino and open road in missouri on land to a non-floating facility, and we plan to build a hotel at our property in cape girardeau. in caruthersville, the new facility will include a newly designed casino with approximately 20% more gaming positions and 75 hotel rooms in total. the new development will provide significant operational efficiencies. the savings on the insurance alone will be around $0.5 million per year.
it would also be significantly more convenient for our customers. it will increase our catchment area and also give us the chance to win back customers who didn't like the old riverboat style when they paid us a first visit. we plan to open that new facility in early 2024. in cape girardeau, we're developing a 75 room hotel that will transfer the property to a full resort destination with gaming, various bars, and dining menus, as well as conference concerts and event spaces.
that hotel is ready for opening at the end of next year. and now, opportunity for growth in missouri sports betting. it has not been legalized yet, but there is a good chance it will this year, which obviously will be very beneficial for us. in west virginia, our mountaineer casino, racetrack & resort had a great quarter, ebitda was up 34%, over q3 of last year.
we continue to make incremental investments into property, such as refurbishing some of the s&p outlets and upgrading the grand entrance experience. we also reconfigured separate areas of the slot floor and introduced new and additional slot product, as well as a new vip gaming area. hotel enhancements include new windows, new bathrooms, new and bigger tvs for the hotel suites to attract higher with players, and also that total rebuild of the outside pool. internationally, our operations in poland generated excellent results.
revenue was up 67%, and ebitda turned positive $3.2 million for the quarter. all our casinos over there are doing well, even without any meaningful business tourism. in fact, revenue over the last couple of weeks was at an all time high. in canada, we operate with severe restrictions during the quarter, as already mentioned, all guest needed to provide proof of vaccination.
everybody was required to wear a face mask and casinos were not allowed to serve liquor after 11pm. as a result, adjusted ebitda was down 15%. but as mentioned, these restrictions have been lifted last week, actually. and as a direct consequence, results are on the up again.
actually, they are up by more than 20%, in just the first -- first couple of days. let's now cover our balance sheet and liquidity. as of the end of december 2021, we had $108 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $189 million in outstanding debt balance sheet, resulting in net debt of $81 million. a year earlier, our net debt was $130 million, meaning we generated $49 million in free cash the last 12 months.
our strong free cash flow generation is driven by efficient and prudent capex spending programs at our properties, and for favorable regulatory regimes in west virginia and alberta, canada. but if the state are respectively [inaudible] pays for half or even all of their slot machine investments. overall, we have a well-maintained asset base that requires minimum levels of maintenance capex to sustain the current levels of profitability. and we've always had a conservative leverage profile, and we anticipate remaining conservative in the future.
and now to the most recent news, the most exciting news, our announcement to acquire the nugget casino resort in reno sparks nevada. two weeks ago, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 50% of the nugget property company and 100% of the nugget's operating company, for a combined total purchase price of $195 million. in addition, we have a five-year option to purchase the remaining 50% of practical, $405 million plus 2% per year. in connection with that transaction, we have received a firm commitment from goldman sachs for a $350 million senior secured term loan and a $30 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
we expect to close the purchase of 50% of the property company next month in april. and from that time on, we will receive $7.5 million in rent, which is our half of the annual rent payments that flows from the operating company to the property company. we will close that operating company purchase as soon as we get the nevada gaming license, which is expected to take 9 to 12 month. and from then on, we will get all the ebitda and we will pay as the operating company rent to the property company, half of which you obviously pay to ourselves.
in 2021, the nugget is $33 million in ebitda on revenues of revenues of $100 million. we see upside to these numbers, mainly for three reasons; first, during the first half of the year, 2021 there were no conventions or concerts, which normally are a very profitable part of nugget's business; secondly, we anticipate to create synergy effects when we integrate the nugget into our portfolio of north american operations; and thirdly, we already have identified various opportunities to improve the operations, mainly on the slope for the most profitable area of ours. now, some key data of the nugget resort. 60,200 square feet of casino floor, 859 slots and 29 tables, 1300 82 eighty rooms and suites in two hotel towers, a variety of casual and fine dining restaurants, 110,000 square feet convention space, and the very popular amphitheater with 8,565 seats.
with the nuggets being directly adjacent to i-8, and with direct highway on and off ramps, ample parking, both surfacing and parking garage, it is perfectly located for customers coming by car. the traffic count at the nearby intersection is an amazing 260,000 cars per day. here are the top 10 reasons why we love the nuggets; first of all, we purchase an existing operation with the long operating history. that means we have no development risk, no risk of construction delays and no risk of cost overruns; secondly, the market is in a great location.
located directly on i-80, the property gets an exposure that is unparalleled in the reno sparks market; then, the combination of hotel rooms and convention space with 110,000 square feet, the nugget has the largest convention facilities of any hotel casino resort in the market, and it has sufficient rooms to support large conventions; fourth, the previous owner the munnel companies, have invested more than $90 million since 2016, upgrading all hotel rooms, most public areas added a top notch steak house, upgraded or replaced back of house equipment where necessary and the right size the operation. therefore, we do not expect any extra ordinary or meaningful or replacement capex in the next years. and there's a brand new 8,555 plus seat amphitheater that provides us with excellent marketing opportunities. the nugget gaming floor provides opportunities for improvement and growth, control and improve the slot mix, further improve the traffic flow, increase the square footage.
and the nugget has a database of 80,000 active players that we will be able to market in a highly efficient manner. the acquisition offers great potential for synergy effects, as we integrate the stand-alone property into our portfolio of 17 casinos. the transition support of the settler, anthony munnell iii and his team is perfect. we are grateful for that partnership; and last but not least, potential reason why we love the nugget is management.
management of the nugget is excellent. we wanted to stay and continue that growth ahead with us. we have communicated this to management in person of the day we signed the deal. in terms of the broader market dynamics, that substantial economic growth the reno stocks regions, companies like tesla, google, switch data, amazon or apple are coming to the area with the capacity to hire tens of thousands of employees. consequently, the population growth is outpacing the national average and the personal income per capita already at over $72,000 in 2021, is expected to grow further with a key or a 4%.
and not surprisingly, the unemployment rate is only 2.9%. what we also loved about the nugget transaction is that it significantly increases our scale. our revenue is expected to grow by over 25%. but not only that, we also increases our geographic diversity, which substantially reduce our reliance on any one market or property.
proforma for the nugget transaction, we generate our cash flows from 18 properties in silver -- in seven different markets across in regions across north american, europe, and no single property contributes more than 25% of our total ebitda. that is something we always aim for, and that is part of our overall strategy. no reliance on any one market or property. our team has an excellent track record of improving the performance of properties we have acquired.
in fact, we've improved the results of each and every property we have purchased within the first 6 to 12 months of acquisition. when we acquired the three casinos from eldorado caesars, a company with the reputation of being very disciplined and efficient operators, the increased revenue on ebitda almost immediately. and that was before covid-19, that had nothing to do with stimulus payments or any other covid-19 related effects. we did that by listening to local management and focusing the operations on the more profitable revenue centers and drive additional value.
and after that very successful acquisition and integration of these three acquired properties over the last couple of years, all of us are very excited about doing the same all over again, if not better with the nugget transaction. in conclusion, the first one was another great performance of our company and the entire team. our diversified portfolio continues to generate robust ebitda growth, and our operating strategy and that focus on the right customer producing strong and sustainable margins. we will continue to execute on our business plan by growing organically, and by identifying and acquiring on the managed assets and stable price to markets in the u.s..
in our m&a strategy, we will remain prudent with pricing and valuation. we will continue to dedicate resources to capture synergies and provide time to digest the acquisition and recognize value. with that discipline and our strong balance sheet, we are confident to find further opportunities to deploy capital in a manner that consistently builds shareholder value. on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm, as we manage our business during these challenging times.
i thank you for your attention, and we can now start the q&a session. operator, go ahead, please.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of david bain with b. riley. please state your question.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
great. thank you, and congratulations on the latest acquisition. i think it's a great market. very exciting milestone for century.
peter, you did a good job of outlining the structure, but if we can just take a second to review. so, you take over 50% propco next month and you'll begin to receive about $109 million per quarter and rent, like directly to ebitda really flowing all the way through. and then upon nevada approval, beginning of next year, let's call it, you get the whole ebitda trailing $12 million, $33 million less $7.5 million in rent. but that doesn't include certain shows of hands that you outlined that weren't in there.
probably, some benefits from structural upgrades and certain cost synergies and other performance enhancers that you've executed on previous mergers is that summarize things? just so i can get it right.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yes, absolutely, david. that's the right picture.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
ok. perfect. and then it looks like there's a lot of growth and synergies that identified revenue and cost wise. and i know you're not quantifying it today, per se, but are you saying material potential increases versus that $33 million at this point? or is there anything more that you can give us there?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
erwin, can you come in on that? --
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. the short answer would be yes, we see material possibilities and upsides to give you just two examples. as peter mentioned already, the slot floor, we think, provides a significant upside potential. the average age of machines is rather old [inaudible], and we know that bringing a new product will just help the revenues immensely.
and the second thing that we want to do is, when you look in the evening of the five large properties, the five last resorts in -- we know there is only one which is not literally well at night and that's the market. and we think that with the number of cars that peter mentioned before 260,000 cars a day, it just makes a lot of sense to invest into a [inaudible] with good signage and good light -- two examples, and of course, we could go on, but just to give you a first scene.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
very interesting -- right. and then my second follow up, if i could. and i know you've addressed this erwin in the past, and peter. but just given the macro or geopolitical environment, are you still not seeing any pockets or rising oil costs could have a material impact and really either direction throughout the portfolio?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
if i may take that? no. oil prices have been going up and down over the over the years, and we have never -- when they start, when the prices went up, we haven't really seen a negative impact on the business. and conversely, when they went down again, it wasn't the other way around either. the one thing that could be said is with regard to our our facilities in alberta, canada, in that area, higher oil prices obviously, a boost for the economy.
so that would even be good.
david bain -- b. riley -- analyst
ok. very good. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from the line of chad beynon with macquarie. please state your question.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. peter, wanted to to start with poland. you said that the fourth quarter, obviously was very strong and you even said the past couple of weeks, revenues have continued without any international inbound.
just wondering how we should think about this, given the current situation in ukraine and russia? obviously, that could affect the international inbound, but just wanted to get a better sense of what you're seeing on the ground and what your consumers are thinking from day to day standpoint thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
we -- it's in a way unfortunate, but we we see on positive impact so far. there's more people in poland than before, and if that has something to do with it, but the impact is positive. erwin, do we know exactly what's behind the uptick in revenues?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
i think, it's mainly just the pent up demand. we had so many restrictions for such a long time and people are just so happy that they can indicate going unrestricted again, and that's wonderful. and then, maybe i would like to mention all of our casinos of [inaudible] and west warsaw, so we are quite far away from the border to the ukraine.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
ok. thanks. also in poland, is there any additional thought in terms of how we're thinking about the warsaw license, which i believe is up for renegotiation or rebidding in 2022? is that something given the nugget acquisition and some of the other cash needs in the united states? how are you thinking about rebidding in that market, 
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
chad, when we apply for new licenses in poland, there's absolutely no investment necessary. it's all done on qualitative criteria. we would simply continue paying rent at the properties at the hotel where we have our casinos, erwin, do you want to add something?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
no, no. absolutely. i was about to say the same.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yeah. so there's no investment associated with getting a new license.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
ok. great. and then lastly, just a follow up to david's question on the propco nugget calculus. can you just explain why the 50% made sense? and how we should think about the likelihood of you taking everything in-house? or if the opportunity would be more for i guess, taking that rent off of your balance sheet? and that's all for me.
thank you very much.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, chad. ultimately the outcome of a negotiation and -- be very much like that, that structure, because it gives us a lot of flexibility. we control the entire resort, we can close on that option to require the remaining 50% at any time at the fixed price.
but we don't have to. so what that means for us is like in terms of capex, we continue to look for interesting m&a opportunities. and if you find one, we can then evaluate our cash position, differentiator available at this time, and then decide whether we want to use the funds for that new acquisition or offer for acquiring the other 50%. or theoretically, we could also sell our 50% in the nugget and just keep the opco.
but as of today, we like the nugget very much, and as of today, our intention is to also acquire the remaining 50%.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
ok. great. thanks, and congrats on the acquisition.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jeff stantial with stifel. please state your question.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, good morning, peter, erwin, it's great to hear from you guys. thanks for taking our questions. i just want to start -- the two projects in missouri it did look like the total project cost ticked up a bit since the last time we spoke. you just talked to your degree of comfort that this should be where things shake out ultimately? or should we expect that target to potentially continue to drift off a bit from here on out?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
erwin, do you have something on that?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
we do. what's the question of whether we think it's going to be more expensive?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yeah. we -- the last time we gave the numbers, they were about 5% lower. i think we added some facilities, we changed a little bit the design of the missouri hotel tower. so those numbers that we provided now are the most recent ones and we have high confidence in those numbers, right?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, right.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so just to be clear, this is more just a function of design plan as opposed to inflationary pressures?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yes, we changed the -- [inaudible]
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. perfect. that's really helpful. and then switching gears, on the margins front looked encouragingly stable here in the u.s.
quarter-on-quarter. aside from just some seasonality in colorado, can you just frame the puts and takes here into 2022? sounds like you highlighted some potential for lower margin, but ebitda that accretive non-gaming revenues to take back up, and it does sound like the labor market remains tight in some of these markets. i think you called out missouri, but just curious to get your thoughts there on some -- how we should think about the margin profile entering this year?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
all in all, we think we can keep it like it was in 2021, and we can also say that while the rest it's not been easy with the labor market, but we think the worst is over. we we're fine with in most departments, except maybe in food and beverage and housekeeping. but in essence, that is not such a -- such an urgent question anymore.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. perfect. very helpful and encouraging.
thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
thank you, jeff.

your next question comes from the line of edward engel with roth capital. please state your question.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my question. just back to poland. do you think the geopolitical issues in that part of world could impact your timing or the ability to maybe divest some of those assets?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
we don't -- we don't know yet. we have two companies that are looking at that. they are seeing that the results are very strong, its actually getting stronger day by day. so as of now, we don't see that picture changing.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. and then then onto st. louis. are there any benchmarks or hearing that we should think about our [audio gap] radar maybe track the progress of that lawsuit?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
i do not know that, except i can come back to you on that. what i do know is that we -- that there's two avenues that our people are going. one, is that we are opposing what the city of st. louis wants to do.
and separately from that, we are also introduced with the help of the broad support of political parties. a separate bill that would only deal with our project like bringing the riverboat on land because it's much safer for everybody, and that bill has a lot of support from all political sides and it's moving now through the committees. so we will see by the end of the session in may what kind of progress we are making.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great, and thanks again, congrats on the transaction.

welcome to century casinos q1 2022 earnings conference call. this call will be recorded. [operator instructions] i would like to introduce our host for today's call, mr. peter hoetzinger.
mr. hoetzinger, you may begin.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. with me on the call are my co-ceo and the chairman of century casinos, erwin haitzmann; as well as our chief financial officer, margaret stapleton. as always, before we begin, we would like to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
we provide a detailed discussion of the various risk factors in our sec filings, and we encourage you to review these filings. in addition, throughout our call, we refer to several non-gaap financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted ebitda. reconciliations of our non-gaap performance and legibility measures to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our news release and sec filings, available in the investors' section of our website at cnty.com. i will now provide an overview of the results of the first quarter.
after that, there will be a q&a session. our first quarter results continued the strength of record-breaking performances that we have shown throughout last year. it was a great start to 2022 with record first quarter revenue and record first quarter adjusted ebitda. revenues were up by more than 42% year over year, and ebitda grew an impressive 62% compared to the first quarter of last year.
earnings per share for the quarter were impacted by our loss on the sale of land and bidding in calgary as well as by costs related to the acquisition of the nugget in nevada, we had a combined impact of approximately $3.3 million or $0.11 per share. in addition, our effective income tax rate increased from 22.6% last year to 34.6% this year due to the total earnings we project for this year. our revenue growth was broad-based as each of our three operating segments posted new first quarter revenue records. the continued focus on our core customers and a streamlined cost structure contributed to these great results and margins and allowed us to continue our strong operating momentum from last year.
sequentially, we managed to keep the high margins the same. in the first quarter, we maintained the 23% ebitda margin that we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. compared to pre-covid, meaning the first quarter of 2019, we are well ahead. we actually increased the margin by 800 basis points.
marketing spend continues to remain significantly below pre-covid levels and is expected to continue at its current run rate moving forward. reductions in advertising, direct mail, and promotional expense appear to be sustainable and have not had any negative impact on gaming volumes. the promotional environment across all our markets remains relatively stable, i would call it disciplined and rational for the most part, not much has changed for the last several quarters. other factors impacting margins include labor, food cost, and utilities.
and while labor is tight in some markets, we've been able to maintain our high standards of guest experience. staff count is down by between 15% to 20% compared to pre-covid levels and that appears sustainable. higher food costs can, to a large extent, be offset by increased menu prices. raising the utility costs or rising utility costs are hard to offset, obviously, so there are some incremental expenses, but it has no material impact to our p&l.
also we are facing these cost increases, we are able to maintain margins due to our disciplined operating philosophy and efficient targeted marketing to our high-value customers. in spite of some macroeconomic change -- challenges, if not noticed any meaningful shift in consumer behavior as we look at april and even into may. the customer trends we experienced at the end of 2021 are continuing. looking ahead, we had the impact from stimulus payments in april and may of last year, making second quarter year-over-year comparison challenging for the u.s.
operations. but more than offsetting that is the strong compact of our canadian operations. that results in preliminary numbers for april, significantly beating april of last year. our business is largely gaining centric.
only a minority of our revenue is coming from non-gaming amenities. and we will only open more non-gaming amenities by expanding their opening hours as demand picks up further so that its growth in a profitable way. the geographic diversity of our portfolio with locations in hyperlocal drive two markets with a loyal customer base has proven extremely resilient. resilient not only in light of the pandemic but also in light of changes to oil price or cpi.
with high confidence in the underlying trends of our consumers' behavior, it has not changed since we opened two years ago. our u.s. operations in colorado, missouri, and west virginia grew revenues by 1% on a combined basis. market by market, we saw revenue and ebitda growth in colorado as well as investing.
while missouri was a bit softer in the year-over-year comparison due to the impact of the government stimulus payments of last year. in more detail, we saw that the month of january was impacted by omicron so it was softer than the year before. in february, business got much stronger as the case counts went down and march mandates came off. march was a mixed bag in the year-over-year comparison.
colorado and west virginia were higher, while missouri couldn't quite achieve last year's results, again, which were driven by the stimulants. [inaudible] customer has remained relatively flat to prior year, which has been a positive sign. the main difference is that we saw a significant increase in ungraded play during the prior year as parents were not our typical customers came to the property, the strength of the miles checks. in canada, we operated with the new restrictions for half of the first quarter.
all guests needed to provide proof of vaccination. everybody was required to wear a mask and casinos are not allowed to serve liquor at 11 pm. these restrictions were lifted at the end of february, resulting in an overall reasonably strong quarter for canada. going forward, however, we can expect more from canada, we look forward to the next quarter without restrictions.
poland, surprisingly, had its highest revenue month ever in march and continued its run rate of close to $1 million in ebitda per month. while results in poland are consistently strong, and it is continuing into april and early may. you can imagine that it is difficult to find a buyer offering an attractive price right now. timing is not really an issue for us, as casino's pretty much runs on its own.
it has its own corporate and operation staff in poland and also that does not need any capex from us. quite the opposite. cash flowing from poland to us. let's now look at our balance sheet and liquidity.
on april 1st, we entered into a credit agreement with goldman sachs for a $350 million term loan and a $30 million revolving credit facility. we threw the $350 million under term loan to fund the $95 million market propco acquisition to repay approximately $167 million outstanding under the old credit agreement with macquarie and to find a $100 million escrow fund that will be used to purchase the market propco. so as of april 1st, 2022, after giving effect to the goldman credit agreement. we had $372 million in outstanding debt and approximately $88 million in cash and cash equivalents, resulting in net debt of $284 million.
but please note, net cash and cash equivalent amount does not include the $100 million we have in escrow to fund the market propco acquisition. our strong cash flow generation is driven by our strong operational performance by our efficient capex spending programs at our properties and by favorable regulatory regimes in west virginia, alberta, and canada, which is safe space for half or more of the slot machine investments. our investments in long-term growth opportunities are spearheaded by exciting projects in missouri and nevada. in missouri, we developed a 75-room hotel at our cape girardeau property that we've transformed that facility to a full resort destination with gaming, spas, and dining venues, as well as conference, concert, and event spaces.
it will cost $26 million and is slated for opening at the end of next year. and we developed a land-based casino and hotel facility in colorado city, which will replace our existing old riverboat there. the new facility will cost $47 million and will include a newly designed casino with approximately 20% more gaining positions and also 75 hotel rooms. the new development will provide significant operational efficiencies.
the savings on insurance alone will be around $0.5 million per year. it would be significantly more convenient for our customers. it will increase our catchment area and also give us the chance to win back customers who didn't like the old riverboat style when they paid us the first visit. planning to open that new facility in early 2024.
in nevada, we already invested 95 million and now own half of the market casinos, real estate. we will close on the purchase of 100% of the operating company as soon as licensing is complete. that will cost another $100 million, which you have put in escrow already, as i mentioned. they're very excited about the next transaction and we see considerable upside once we operate it.
we the nugget it purchased an existing operation with a long operating history. that means no development risk, no construction delays or risk of cost overruns. the fact that it's in a great location directly on i-80. the property gets an exposure that is unparalleled in the reno-sparks market.
the nearby intersection counts 206,000 cars per day with 110,000 square feet. the market has one of the largest convention facilities in the market, and with 1382 rooms, it can support large conventions. previous owner. the unnamed companies have invested more than $90 million since 2016, upgrading all hotel rooms.
most public areas added a top-notch steakhouse and upgraded or replaced bags of meat. but we've been through unnecessary and rightsized the operation. therefore, we do not expect any extraordinary replacement capex in the next years. the market gaming floor provides most promising opportunity for improvement and growth.
it can renew and improve the stock mix, further improve the traffic flow. any crease. the square footage the gaming floor. also, the acquisition offers great potential for synergy effects as we integrate that stand-alone property into our portfolio of 17 casinos.
in terms of the broader market dynamics, there is substantial economic growth in the reno-sparks region. population growth is outpacing the national average in the personal income per capita is expected to grow further with a core of about 4%. the unemployment rate is only 2.9%. the nugget transactions with significantly increase our scale.
our revenue is expected to grow by over 25%. with these opportunities for growth throughout next year and beyond, we are confident our company is very well-positioned for continued long-term success. in conclusion, the first quarter was another great performance of our company and the entire team. our diversified portfolio continues to generate robust ebitda growth, and our operating strategy and tight focus on the right customer are producing strong and sustainable margins.
higher end of the database. at the higher end of the database, the truly gaming-centric customers continue to perform extremely well. also, our older customers started to visit again in bigger numbers once the omicron and combatant started to drop mid-quarter. these trends seem to be really consistent.
we continue to execute on our business plan by growing organically and by identifying and acquiring undermanaged assets in stable drive-to markets in the u.s. in our m&a strategy, we will remain prudent with pricing and valuation and will continue to dedicate resources to capture synergies and provide time to digest the acquisition and recognize value. with that discipline and our strong balance sheet, we are confident to find further opportunities to deploy capital in a manner that consistently builds shareholder value. on behalf of the company's management and board, i'd like to thank our team members, our guests, and our stockholders for their continued loyalty and enthusiasm as we manage our businesses during these challenging times.
i thank you for your attention, and we can now start the q&a session. can we go ahead, please?

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] our first question comes from david bain with b. riley. you may proceed with your question.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
great. thank you and congratulations on the execution of quarter. i guess my first one would be if you're able to provide any sort of detail or even broad-based thoughts on 1q performance at the nugget.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
erwin?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
i don't think that we can disclose it at this point in time, right? plus, we don't have the detail to --
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. fair enough. i'll move on. so i guess my next would be, obviously, the macro -- the environment has not been assuming environment has not been impacting real-time results at properties.
i'm wondering because it's impacted valuations if you're beginning to see that or hear potentially about that in the m&a environment if that can move more in your favor in the relative near term.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
yes, david. we are seeing some of that. first of all, the m&a environment, it's more active than it was last year. there are at least a handful of properties on the market.
we are looking at two of those. and yes, i mean it all varies depending on the market and the circumstance. but i don't want to say prices are coming down at all, but the opportunities are really exciting. and some of the opportunities that are being marketed would fit very well into our portfolio.
so you will see us be very active in the next couple of quarters.
david bain -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much, guys.
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from edward engel with roth capital. you may proceed with your question.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question and thanks for the april commentary. i recall a couple of years ago now, when oil prices were falling, it had a pretty negative impact on some of your canadian properties where some of those economies were tied to oil and gas. i guess, with energy prices kind of higher again, i was just wondering if you're seeing any kind of signs of life in some of those markets to maybe reinvigorate demand.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
any comment there?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
yeah. we see that, first of all, we see before that canada is really on a very healthy recovery track, and we are more or less back at pre-covid levels, but -- and we think that really the next and the coming quarters, we'll show the full impact of the recovery as most of those sections are only listed halfway through the quarter. now in general terms, we can only be positive if the oil prices go up as far as eight months and months and operations are concerned. but it would be too early to say that that increase that we see is due to the oil price rate.
i think in the second quarter, we would be able to be more specific on that and have a better picture about that.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. and i guess we look forward to it. and then i guess one more kind of housekeeping. after the refinancing, i was just wondering, could you kind of give some commentary on how we should expect cash interest expense over the next couple of quarters?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
take it, please.
margaret stapleton -- chief financial officer
so are you looking for what the interest expense will be? it's probably around 7%.
edward engel -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. and then -- ok. that's perfect.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
ok.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from jeff stantial with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey. good morning, peter. it's great to hear from you both. for my first question, i'd like to hang on this macro theme that's been common throughout this earnings season.
it sounds like on the whole, the consumer still feels pretty healthy into april and thus far into may. but could we unpack that a little bit? you talked about sequential improvement in the older demographic. you talked about continued healthy growth at the high end. just moving to the third category, how things are trending kind of in the lower end of the database, -- anything to call out there? or do trends feel stable there as well?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
it's stable. exactly. it's stable. so we watched it very closely as well.
same for the obvious interest that we don't really see anything that would be deviant from what was said before
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. ok. very good. thank you for that.
and then just sequential upside still left in the older demographic. how about over in west virginia with mountaineer. how are things working through post omicron with respect to some of the non-gaming amenities that have been called relatively more impacted through covid? do you still see significant sequential upside there as we kind of roll through 2022?
erwin haitzmann -- co-chief executive officer and chairman
we in the nongaming sector, it's obviously really secondary and in western virginia, as i said in earlier times, post-covid, we opened with significantly less fmc capacity, and it hasn't purpose at all on the customer side, but certainly has helped us a lot on the cost side. and what we have now is just rightsized. and also, as peter mentioned, before we would expand opening times, for example, an offer, we look very closely at whether we think it's justified. concerning the player base, i think you could say that in very general terms, we see that the upper end of power players tend to stay a little longer tend to come more often tend to spend a little more money.
and maybe we have a few  less customers on the lower end, something that we are not unhappy about because it clearly helps us on the staffing side and on the cost side for simple terms for less customers, we need less employees, and that certainly helps for us.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. thank you.
and then if i could just squeeze in one more. i saw your commentary in the deck around upgrades to your marketing app. just curious, are you evaluating anything else on the technology front, whether it's some sort of cashless gaming wallet or anything else that you think is interesting out there as you evaluate potential technology upgrades of your properties?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
nothing that would be nothing other than rotten upgrades of the existing systems. -- one upgrade that we did in west virginia was that you can now open your hotel room with the mobile phone and you can also check-in mobile and don't have to stand in line anymore, which is really helpful, like on a friday afternoon when all the people -- or our guest data coming for the weekend in the past they had to line up.
jeff stantial -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful, guys. thanks for all the color.
operator
our next question comes from chad beynon with macquarie. you may proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
hi. this is aaron on for chad. thanks for taking my question and congrats on closing the first part of the nugget acquisition. you noted the large convention facility at that property.
do you have a sense for what the convention and event calendar looks like in '22 and '23? is it expected to be at pre-pandemic levels?
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
that's the indication we have. yes, it's come back strongly and the bookings are good, and we see and at all that, it's in the area of pre pandemic.
unknown speaker
ok. great. and moving on, i want to touch on poland for a second. it looks like demand remains strong, but margins were ticked down a little bit sequentially.
was that just seasonality? or is there anything you would call out? and how should we think about that going forward? thanks.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
important we had the best quarter ever. and so did you say that you saw that the numbers are going down?
unknown speaker
margins. margins.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
the margins. ok. ok. yeah.
that is one simple reason namely the salaries. we had to increase salaries because we haven't done that in a long time. and it's really difficult to get started to begin with them to get a good start is even harder. but it's obviously more than in absolute numbers, it's more than compensated by the higher revenues.
unknown speaker
got it. ok. understandable. thanks for the color.
peter hoetzinger -- vice chairman, president, and co-chief executive officer
next question.
operator
we have no further phone questions at this time, sir. i will turn the call over to yourself for any closing remarks.
