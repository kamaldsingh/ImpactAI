good day, everyone, and welcome to today's fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2021 preliminary financial results. [operator instructions] later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please note that this call may be recorded. it is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to vince klinges, cfo of american software.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, amy. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i will review the numbers.
but first, our safe harbor statement. this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control.
future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call. such factors include but are not limited to changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effective competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures, and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate.
at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to allan for opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. as the number of individuals obtaining the coronavirus vaccines continued to escalate through the spring, business leaders' confidence grew and project activity took off. as we all know, globally, we're not out of the woods yet in regards to this catastrophic impact of this virus, so we want to encourage everyone to stay strong and diligent. we can now see a path to a more normal environment and that end of this -- and the end of this tragic event is within reach.
as an organization, we've been blessed with good health, and the diversity of our team has allowed us to serve our customers well throughout the pandemic. having achieved a phenomenal level of vaccination across our team, we've now shifted back toward in-person meetings internally, and in some cases, externally as well. we anticipate that by fall we'll have entered into the new post-pandemic work structure. the pandemic and the ensuing global crisis heightened the awareness of the overall supply chain responsibilities for brands, retailers, and producers.
i characterized these responsibilities into three categories, economically sound delivery of goods to consumers and brand producers, including an appropriate level of resiliency to the disruptions. the second, minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain from raw material to consumer delivery. and the third leg, which in my opinion is the most important, is the ethical treatment of workers around the world. we have decades of experience in enabling economically optimized resilient supply chains.
in the past decade, we've incorporated the environmental impact into decision making and we are now at the forefront of ensuring adherence to proper labor standards in alignment with the united states customs and border protection regarding their latest regulations. through our customers, we are enabling sustainable supply chains while simultaneously addressing these economic, environmental, and social responsibility imperatives in a whole new way. leveraging our unsurpassed expertise and our solutions, we're enabling the necessary transformations that are required to meet today's consumer expectations. in regard to our fourth-quarter results, i am pleased to announce that our team excelled.
throughout the pandemic, our team has remained focused on serving customers, delivering on our implementation commitments, and bringing new companies into our customer community around these transformative projects. we generated a record level of net new acv growth in the fourth quarter, more than doubling our previous high for a quarter. with the increase in new project activity and as we move beyond the pandemic-related churn and return to more traditional stability of our cloud and on-prem customers, we expect to see the rise in our recurring revenues accelerate. in the fourth quarter, we saw our cloud services' acv grow by 45% when compared to last quarter's fourth quarter -- last year's fourth quarter, which was comparable to the pre-pandemic growth rates.
included in this acceleration is an increasing number of cloud conversions. that's our existing on-prem customers switching to the cloud, which typically drives a significant uplift in the overall recurring revenue from each converted customer as we layer in higher value-added services. vince will provide more detail on the impact of this in our financial model in his commentary. during the fourth quarter, we welcomed seven new customers and completed subscription or licensee transactions in nine countries, reflecting our strong global presence.
in the fourth quarter, services -- the services performance of our supply chain segment was in line with our strong growth expectations, coming in at the highest level for the fiscal year. we continue to drive more backlog for future work, which is consuming most of the resource capacity we have on hand, including a growing consumption of external capacity from our consulting partner channels. as we move forward, we plan to add additional resources internally and allocate a greater share of implementation work to our partners. with the growing backlog, expanding partner network, and continuing to leverage the more efficient virtual work environment, we expect to see the seasonally adjusted consulting services revenue and margin continue to grow in the coming quarters.
we're pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which now represents approximately 60% of total revenues, compared to 57% in the same period last year. we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to continue trending higher in the future considering that subscription contracts represent virtually all of our new contract revenue. with a very disciplined approach and a focus on transformational-type projects, our sales activity is running at a strong pace. and as a result, we're continuing to see growth in our pipeline, both in the number of opportunities and the size of the transactions.
we're seeing customers adopt a broader footprint of our platform to improve the speed and quality of decision-making and allows them to achieve the agility and resiliency needed to thrive in this new economy. the new calendar year has shown a resurgence of customers investing in transformational projects that is helping to drive our pipeline, both in the number of opportunities, as well as average size. these projects are driven by the need to holistically manage supply chain sustainably in an economically resilient way. based on these ofs -- these same observations, late last year, gartner predicted spending in the supply chain planning solutions would trend toward an industry-leading growth rate, which we're starting to see that trend emerge.
in summary, we're extremely pleased with the fourth-quarter results and overall performance of our team throughout the fiscal year, working hand-in-hand with our customers as we navigated the challenges presented by the pandemic. the fourth quarter is a strong reflection of what we're capable of delivering to our customers and the financial performance of our company. our mission of making our customers more successful year after year is paying off in customer retention and expansion as we introduce innovative capabilities for managing sustainable supply chains. we are confident that we can continue to grow both revenue and profitability in the years ahead and are proud to be delivering incremental benefits for our customers in a time when they need it most.
at this time, i'll turn the call over to vince who'll provide more details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thanks, allan. for the first -- fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, revenues were $28.6 million, down 2% from $29.3 million in the same period last year as we continue to transition to the saas model. subscriptions fees increased 28% year over year to $8.1 million, while license fees were $1.2 million, compared to $1.1 million in the prior year. although license fees were up slightly in the fourth quarter, which principally came from existing customers, we continue to expect declines over time given our transition to the saas model.
near-term, we anticipate our license revenues on a quarterly basis are likely to be closer to trend, which are -- is about $0.5 million a quarter seen throughout the past year. our cloud services' acv, or annual contract value, increased 45% to $38.3 million, versus $26.4 million a year ago. we added $6.7 million in new acv during the quarter, which was more than double our prior record and reflected the closure of two deals with acv in excess of $1 million. nearly half our new net acv was from new customers and -- which was similar to last quarter.
our saas churn rate remained at levels more consistent with our pre-covid rate. and as allan noted, our pipeline of opportunities has also increased, leaving us well-positioned to deliver strong acv growth in fiscal '22 and beyond. professional services and other revenues decreased 13% to $10.1 million from $11.5 million a year ago. the year-over-year decline reflects a 13% decrease in our supply chain unit and an 11% decrease in our tpm or our it consulting business unit due to timing of project work.
we note that restrictions on travel reduced the amount of pass-through reimbursements in our supply chain services revenue to zero from $0.2 million last year. on a sequential basis, services revenues did increase 6%, and that's primarily attributed to a 13% increase in our supply chain unit. our backlog of supply chain implementations increased significantly due to the increase in acv bookings this quarter, so we anticipate an uptick in services in the fiscal '22. maintenance revenues declined 12% year over year to $9.2 million, and this is reflecting a higher than normal falloff rate for this quarter.
but if you exclude the companies converting from on-prem maintenance to the cloud, the decline would have been about 8%, which is more consistent with our mid-single-digit decline we've historically seen. as of q4, acv bookings also included a large conversion deal. so we expect the declines in our maintenance revenues to remain elevated in the near term. however, as we typically see, a two and 2.5x uplift in maintenance revenue once the company shifts to subscription, we expect a commensurate acceleration of our subscription revenue growth.
total recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees together represented 60% of total revenues in q4, and that's up from 57% in the same period last year. our gross margin was 58% for the current period, versus 54% in the same period last year. that's primarily due to increase of our subscription fee margin to 61%, compared to 57% in the prior year. and that's primarily due to increased subscription revenues and lower amortization of cap software expense.
excluding the noncash amortization of capitalized software expense of $686,000 in q4, our subscription margin would have been 70%, and that compares to 72% last year where the amortization of cap software was $994,000 in the prior-year period. license fee margin was 67%, compared to 22% in the same period last year, and that's primarily due to higher license fees, and lower costs of amortization expense, and [inaudible] agent commissions. our services margin increased to 36% from 31% last year, and that's due to a higher mix of revenue coming from our higher margin supply chain business unit. our maintenance margin was 79%, compared to 83% a year ago, and that's primarily due to lower revenue.
looking at gross margins -- excuse me, gross r&d expenses were 15% of total revenues for both the current and prior-year period. our capitalized r&d expenses totaled $16,000, and that was down from $473,000 in the same period last year, which is reflecting our transition to the cloud and adopting an agile development process. so we do not expect any material caps -- r&d caps off going forward. sales and marketing expenses were 18% of revenues for the current period, and that compares to eight -- 20% in the same period last year.
the year-over-year decline in absolute dollars continues to reflect the reduction of travel and marketing expenses due to the covid pandemic. g&a expenses were 19% of total revenues, compared to 16% a year ago. and that's primarily due to re -- timing of recur -- recording some variable compensation. on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 20% to $1.9 million for this quarter, and that compares to 1.6 in the same period last year.
our net income increased 460% to $3.1 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.09, compared to net income of $0.5 million or $0.02 earnings per diluted share last year. on an adjusted basis, which excludes noncash amortization of intangibles related to acquisition and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased 8% to $2.6 million, compared to 2.4 in the same period last year. adjusted ebitda was 3.7, or down 4%, from 3.9 in the same period last year. and adjusted net income was 3.6, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.11 in the fourth quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of 1.3 or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.04 in the same period last year.
international revenues this quarter were approximately 15% of total revenues, compared to 17% in the prior-year quarter. taking a look at the full-year fiscal 2021, total revenues declined 4% year over year to $111 million -- $111.4 million to be exact, as a 31% increase of subscription fees to $28.9 million was offset by lower license fees, services, and maintenance revenues. so adjusted operating income for the year was $7.6 million, representing an operating margin of 7%, and that's down from $9.7 million or 8% operating margin last year. adjusted ebitda was 12.5 versus 16.1 in the same period last year.
and adjusted net income totaled $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, and that's up from 9.9 or $0.31 earnings per diluted share of the same period last year. we exited the fourth quarter with remaining performance obligations, or rpo, which we refer to as backlog, of $116 million, and that represents a year-over-year increase of 51%. the strong growth in rpo reflects our recording -- record bookings for the quarter and an increase in the duration of our cloud agreements as customers continue to make longer-term commitments on our platform. taking a look at our balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with total cash and investments of approximately $104.7 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of approximately $10 million compared to the same period last year.
our days' sales outstanding as of april 31, 2021, was 85 days for the current period, and that compares to 78 days in the same period last year. the increase is primarily due to the increase in bookings at the end of the quarter. during the quarter, we paid $3.6 million in dividends. and at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to questions.
amy? 
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] and we will take our first question from matt pfau. your line is open. go ahead. 
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question and great quarter. first, wanted to hit on the two deals that were with acv in excess of 1 million. maybe just some more detail around those.
were those new or existing customers, and what drove that large deal size? and then when you look at the pipeline, are there other sort of similar-sized deals in there as well?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
hey, matt, thank you for the question and compliments. so on the first half, both of those projects happen to be with existing customers. and in both cases, the -- well, one was a lift and shift where we converted to -- the entire platform to the new environment -- new cloud environment, and then added functionality. so it was a substantial increase in the amount of functionality and breadth of capabilities.
the other is what we've turned to be a greenfield application. so the existing applications are going to stand alone and we are looking at a complete new way of managing their supply chain and helping them not only with the platform but helping them with a new viewpoint, consulting and advising them on a new viewpoint on how to manage the supply chain in a whole new way in this marketplace. so it's a start over. and ultimately, in time, we'll replace the current applications.
but again, an uplift and an amount of functionality as well. so both of those happen to be existing customers expanding the footprint this time around. and quite frankly, i forgot the second half of your question, matt. so if you wouldn't mind to repeat the second half of the question, i'd be happy to answer that as well.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
yeah, no problem. it was just around the pipeline and, you know, are there other deals of this size in the pipeline? you did mention that deal sizes increased and so just trying to sort of understand. are these outliers or is this sort of going to become more commonplace to have deals of this size? 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we -- no assurance that we'll get two or more done in any given quarter. but there are certainly many -- a number more in the pipeline that the size of the transactions are starting to -- it's continuing to increase. so throughout this year -- last year, they were hard to come by just for that magnitude of imple -- of investment. in the year ahead, we anticipate that maybe not every quarter, but consistently through the year ahead, we'll have projects of this magnitude happening with us. 
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and then just in general within your pipeline or i guess if we look at the deal that closed this quarter, were these deals that had been in the pipeline for a while, and then, you know, as economic outlook started to improve, they converted? and then sort of where do other deals in your pipeline stand from that perspective? you know, i guess, obviously, you have two large deals that, you know, really made the sequential acv net increase large this quarter. and i'm just trying to sort of figure out as we sort of think about growth going forward, what sort of puts and takes this quarter we should think about when we're thinking about future growth.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question. a real mix. one of the -- one of those two large projects had lingered for some time, and it took them a while to get there.
and the second one, actually, accelerated pretty quickly through the entire process, from a decision to go forward to make the investment to getting the contract in place. so even in the large deals, we had the two ends of the spectrum really. overall, we're seeing a pickup in the pace. however, right now with the pandemic still in place and most people are still working remotely, it is a bit of a challenge to get everything coordinated to get the approvals done.
so we haven't seen a radical shift in the pace at which we can get from selection or even commencement of the evaluation all the way to selection and contract. although, we're starting to see that pick-up as well. so we feel good about it. we did have a bit of carry-over into the first quarter.
we've made some good progress on the first quarter already. so we're seeing that -- you know, we didn't clean up everything in the fourth quarter. there were some lingering, and we're off and running on those projects already so that we feel good about that as well. and -- but i think as the year progresses, i'm a little bit nervous about the summer, i happened to take some time off last week and we witnessed that there's an awful lot of people out taking vacation right now, including our family.
so i'm a bit wondering about the summer period. but overall, this year is really picking up.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
ok, great. and just last question for me. obviously, there's a lot of supply chain issues going on right now, and i think planning could be a key component of helping with some of those issues. but does that create any distractions within your customer base, or is it more of a net positive the issues that are going on right now with people having shortages and difficulty managing their supply chain? 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
overall, it's a net positive, matt. yeah, it's a good observation. you know, there's a couple of product -- pockets where people are just, you know, in such a big state of distress that they're having a hard time to focus. but that's few and far between.
i think, overall, people are seeing -- what did occur during the pandemic is people realized you can't just outrun it. you've got to out plan it. you've got to think about where the bottlenecks are. you've got to be able to model those.
and when the issues occur, you've got to be able to quickly assess what your options are and make decisions rapidly. otherwise, you get outrun by your competition and any options that may have been available to you are no longer available because you didn't act fast enough. so that has brought an acute awareness of the need for building what we call a digital model, being able to represent the physical supply chain electronically, simulate the possibilities, make a quick decision, and act. you can't outrun the challenges, you have to out plan the challenges.
and that's really where our expertise lies. so the overall view is that the pandemic has heightened the awareness and brought to light the urgency of acting on these transformational projects and getting something in place so that they -- they know the next one's coming. we don't know what it is or what it's going to be. but they know the next disruption is going to be there because they've always been there, and they think -- the customers are starting to make those investments.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks, guys, appreciate it.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. 
operator
[operator instructions] and we will take our next question from zach cummins. your line is open. go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hi, allan and vince, congrats on a strong quarter, and thanks for taking my question. i guess, allan, what really has changed in the mind of some of your existing customers? i know really that from your perspective, you haven't been forcing these customers to shift over from an on-premise model to the cloud. but to see this magnitude of conversions. i mean, what is really changing there? are you starting to incentivize customers to move over, or -- i'm just trying to get a sense of the dynamics that you're seeing.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
great question, zach, and thank you for joining us. we've not shifted our thinking or any incentives in a way that would encourage them to do it from a financial standpoint, that we've offered any extra spiff or anything like that. it's truly what's happening is that -- even our existing customers, as well as they're running it -- the applications today, they realize that there's more to be had, that the current releases, they're having a hard time keeping up with that we -- in many cases, as i mentioned about some of the two larger transactions, they're adding functionality and they want it all in one cohesive place so that they have a single platform, and they know we can manage it better for them. so that's a view that's really starting to drive the thinking.
and as they go to extend the footprint, they just -- they move it to the cloud because they know it's a better solution for them. we're going to take better care of them. we're going to keep them up to date more frequently. and they can get advantage on the new technology that we're making available on each new release.
so we've still not -- we don't -- we've not and we don't think we're going to have to provide any special incentives, just the benefits associated with moving to our cloud environment and our value-added services has been enough to change that. so in the past, i'm probably giving you a little more answer than you asked for. but, you know, in the past, we were seeing a fairly low conversion rate, maybe one or two per quarter where we're converting from on-premise to the cloud. and we're anticipating that this year ahead that we're looking at, you know, three or four a quarter will probably be in the conversion rate that we should expect going forward.
so, you know, it's still not a crazy number. it's not half of our installed base converting, but it's double what it was last year. i guess you could look at it from that perspective. 
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
i understand, that's helpful. and then in terms of your sales and marketing capacity. i mean, just given the demand that you're seeing, do you feel like you have enough capacity in place right now and kind of what is the approach for when it comes to investing in headcount and your go-to-market approach?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think -- well, of course, we have two channels that we've talked about in the past. we've got our direct sales model, which is for large enterprises, organizations in north america and europe. we think we're in pretty good shape in that environment. we -- during the pandemic, we didn't pull back.
we continued to invest and we expanded the team because we wanted to be ready -- shovel ready when we came out of the pandemic. so we think we're in a good position at least for the first half. maybe it'll carry us through the year. we're going to really focus on the productivity of the team we have and make sure that we're getting all the value.
it takes some time to get them on board and we're there. they're ready to go. they're working hard. they've got pipeline.
they're generating results. in regards to our indirect channel, which gives us local presence through a value-added reseller network, we are continuing to expand capacity there. we've got segments of the globe that are really maturing from a supply chain standpoint and they're starting to look for solutions. so we're trying to fill that in, and we've got a few pockets where we need to expand coverage and get some more resource in place.
so we'll probably -- over the next year, we'll probably add about a handful more of strategic partners that are -- those value-added resellers. and then i made mention of, of course, the expanding partner network from an implementation resource standpoint. as we look forward, we think that that channel will be able to fulfill at least half of the expanded service requirements that we have for the growing customer deployments. and that ecosystem builds on itself.
i mean, number one, they've got resources for us that can help us implement and provide good guidance and support for customers, but they also are generating activity out in the marketplace and they'll fold that back in and bring those opportunities to us as well. so that's a double benefit from the standpoint of that partner network.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and, allan, can you give us an update on the overall competitive environment? i mean, with blue yonder in the midst of being acquired, i'm just wondering if you've seen any sort of changes in the dynamics of the environment? 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
a couple of things that are probably most significant. one is really around the erp players where we're continuing to see the likes of oracle and sap, and maybe even to some extent and a lesser extent, they're not quite so prominent in our space, infor and some others, they just don't have the depth of capability and breadth that's necessary to fulfill the requirements of today's supply chain projects. so we're continuing to see defections. those who may have been, you know, acutely biased toward sap, for instance, are making decisions to move away, and we're picking up some business from that channel.
so that's a continuing evolving competitive landscape. we're not yet sure what will come about from the blue yonder being acquired -- wholly acquired by panasonic where they've picked up the rest of the company and own it all now. there's one thing for sure though that there'll be changes. and what those changes -- they know what those changes are.
but we're seeing a little bit of chaos out there in the marketplace. our folks are just not sure what's happening, and i think that'll take a little time for it to settle out. so we could have a window here where there's some confusion around just what that strategy means. 
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
understood. and my final question is more of a financial one. i know you don't provide formal guidance. but, vince, i was wondering if you could just give us a sense of -- i mean, your overall targets for revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin as we progress in the upcoming year?
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
was it -- zach, yeah, as you know, we don't give guidance. but generally, we're hoping to grow to maybe the low double-digits rates on the revenue side. and with that kind of growth, we should be able to get closer to maybe somewhere between 12% to 15% adjusted ebitda percentages. 
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
helpful. thank you. well, thanks again, guys, for taking my questions, and then congrats again on the strong quarter.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, zach.

vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, chloe. good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's first quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i will review the numbers.
but first, our safe harbor statement. this call -- conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control.

at this time, i'll turn the call over to allan for our opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. in spite of the resurgence of the coronavirus, we're starting a transition back to in-person activities, and business leaders' confidence and willingness to invest remains intact. as we all know, globally, we're not out of the woods yet in regards to the catastrophic impact of this virus. so, we want to encourage everyone to stay strong and be safe.
as an organization, we've continued to be blessed with good health, with only a few isolated coronavirus issues. the diversity of our team in skills, experience, and location has allowed us to serve our customers well throughout the pandemic. we anticipate that this fall, we'll be able to transition into the new postpandemic work structure. however, we have a keen eye on the infection rates, and we'll adjust those plans appropriately.
the pandemic and ensuing global crisis heightened the awareness of the overall supply chain responsibilities for brands, retailers, and producers. as a result, more and more of the projects we're getting involved in are transformational in nature versus the historical tactical projects around one or two particular business processes. the traits of a transformational project typically aligned to three objectives: economically sound delivery of goods to consumers with an appropriate level of resiliency to disruptions, minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain from raw materials to consumer delivery, and the third leg of corporate responsibility, which includes the ethical treatment of workers around the world. we have decades of experience in enabling economically optimized resilient supply chains.
in the past decade, we've incorporated the environmental impact to decision making, and we are at the forefront of corporate compliance, which has been consuming a lot of mindshare and is now starting to consume budget. through our customers, we're enabling sustainable supply chains while simultaneously addressing these economic, environmental, and social responsibility imperatives in a whole new way that is enabling the necessary transformations that are required to meet today's consumer expectations. not surprisingly, these transformational projects draw a high level of scrutiny and longer approval cycles due to the perceived risk associated with changing business processes and the concern for their ability to manage such a significant change while still navigating the pandemic in the work-from-home situation. although the approval process is making the timing of contracts of these transformational projects a little less predictable, the increasing number of those projects in our pipeline should ultimately result in more consistent cadence of one or more of these contracts signing each quarter.
in regard to our first-quarter results, i'm pleased to announce that we're off to a solid start on the fiscal year. the market has stabilized, which is evidenced by our growing pipeline, increased rpo, and lower churn while adding new contracts that continue to build our acv and services backlog. the summer months are always a slow period, but our team continued to sign contracts and delivering customer services like they have throughout the pandemic, with a keen focus on serving existing customers, delivering on our implementation commitments, and bringing new companies into our customer community. aside from the services, we're on plan or slightly ahead across all revenue and margin areas.
our first-quarter services performance in our supply chain segment was impacted somewhat by the seasonally slow summer period, which resulted in a continued increase in services backlog. in particular, the large projects that we signed in q4 got underway late in q1, limiting their contribution to the quarter financial results, but setting the stage for a return to more positive growth in the services revenue over the remainder of the year. with the growing backlog, expanding partner network, and continuing leverage of the more efficient virtual work environment, we expect to see the seasonally adjusted consulting services margin expand modestly in the coming quarters as well. we're pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which now represents approximately 66% of total revenues, compared to 61% in the same period last year.
that was driven by the 49% increase in cloud services acv we saw in the first quarter when compared to last year's first quarter. with the increase in new project activity, which we -- are now virtually all subscription contracts and a return to the more traditional stability of our cloud and on-prem customer community, we expect to see the recurring revenue, as a percent of total revenue, continue to rise. the steady increase in subscription revenue was also revealing the efficiency gains we expected in cloud services, as evidenced by the gross margin exceeding 75% in the first quarter. with a very disciplined approach and a focus on transformational-type projects, our sales activity is running at a strong pace.
and as a result, we're continuing to see growth in our pipelines. during the first quarter, we welcomed five new customers and completed subscription or license fee transactions in eight countries, reflecting our strong global presence. we're seeing customers adopt the broader footprint of our platform to improve the speed and quality of decision making that allows them to achieve the agility and resiliency needed to thrive in this new economy. in the first half of this calendar year, we've seen a resurgence of customers investing in transformational projects that is helping to drive our pipeline to higher levels.
these projects are driven by the need to holistically manage supply chain sustainably in an economically resilient way. based on these same observations, gartner predicted a trend to higher spending in supply chain planning solutions, and we're starting to see that trend emerge. in summary, we're pleased with our first-quarter results and overall performance of our team as we work hand-in-hand with our customers to navigate the challenges presented by the pandemic. the first quarter is a strong reflection of what we are capable of delivering to our customers and the potential for performance improvements of our financial model.
our mission of making our customers more successful year after year is paying off in customer retention and expansion as we introduce innovative capabilities for managing sustainable supply chains. we're confident that we can continue to grow both revenue and profitability in the years ahead and are proud to be delivering incremental benefits for our customers in a time when they need it most. at this time, i'll turn the call over to vince, who'll provide the details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thanks, allan. for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenues were 29.3 million. that's a 7% increase from 27.3 million in the same period last year, primarily driven by subscription fees, which increased 54% year over year to 9.8 million. while software license revenues were 0.5 million, compared to 0.8 million last year.
and that's all -- that's primarily due to the continued transition to the cloud services as a service. our cloud acv number increased 49% to 40.9 million, versus 27.5 million a year-ago period. we added 2.5 million in net new acv during the quarter, which includes one deal in excess of 1 million. over 70% of our net new acv was from new customers.
and similar to last quarter, our saas churn rate remained at levels more consistent with our pre-covid rate. as allan noted, our pipeline and opportunities has also increased, leaving us well-positioned to deliver strong acv growth in fiscal '22 and beyond. professional services and other revenues decreased 3% to 9.5 million from 9.8 million a year ago. this year-over-year decline reflects an 11% decrease in our tpm or our it consulting business unit due to the timing of project work, and that was partially offset by a 6% increase in our supply chain unit.
our backlog of supply chain implementations increased significantly due to the increase in acv bookings in the recent quarters. so, we anticipate an uptick in services during the remaining quarters of fiscal '22. maintenance revenues declined 8% year over year to 9.5 million, reflecting a normal fall-off rate. our total recurring revenue is comprised of subscription and maintenance fees, represented 66% of our total revenues for the first quarter, and that's up from 61% in the same period last year.
so, looking at gross margin, it was 58% for the current period, versus 52% in the same period last year. our subscription fee margin increased to 67%, compared to 57% in the prior-year period. and that's primarily due to the increased subscription revenue and lower amortization of capitalized software expense. if you exclude the noncash amortization of cap software expense of 819,000 for the first quarter, our subscription gross margin would have been 75%, versus 72% last year since the amortization of cap software was 959,000 in the prior-year period.
our license fee margin was 68%, compared to 14% in the same period last year, and that's primarily due to lower cost of amortization expense, amortization of cap software, and lower var agent commission expense. service margin increased to 26% from 20% last year, and that's primarily due to the mix of revenue from our higher margin supply chain unit. our maintenance margin was 79%, compared to 83% last year. and that's primarily due to lower revenue.
our gross r&d expenses were 15% of total revenues for both the current and prior-year period. our sales and marketing expenses were 21% of revenues versus -- in the current period, compared to 17% in the prior-year periods, and this year-over-year increase was due to increased marketing expenses, increase in variable compensation, and the reorganization of some functional personnel from a business unit g&a role to sales. our g&a expenses were 15% of total revenues, compared to 16% a year ago, due to the reorganization of functional personnel that i just mentioned. on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 100% to 1.8 million for the current quarter, and that compares to 0.9 million in the same period last year.
net income increased 45% to 2.9 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.09. and that compares to net income of 2 million or $0.06 in the same period last year. as on an adjusted basis, which excludes noncash amortization of intangible expense related to acquisition and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased 49% to 2.6 million, and that's compared to 1.7 million in the same period last year. adjusted ebitda increased 18% to 3.7 million, versus 3.1 million in the same period last year.
and our adjusted net income increased 28% to 3.6 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.11 for the first quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of 2.8 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.09 from the same period last year. international revenues this quarter were approximately 17% of revenues, compared to 15% in this prior-year period. our remaining performance obligation, we exited the quarter with a backlog of 20 -- excuse me, 122 million, and that represents a year-over-year increase of 63%. the strong growth in rpo reflecting -- reflects record bookings in recent quarters and an increase in the duration of our cloud agreements as customers continue to make longer-term commitments to our platform.
our financial position remains strong, with total cash and investments of approximately 108.1 million at the end of the quarter, and this is an increase of approximately 15.1 million compared to the same period last year. our days' sales outstanding as of july 31, 2021, was 78 days for the current period, and that compares to 88 days in the same period last year. and this decrease primarily due to improved collections compared to last year. and also, during the quarter, we paid 3.6 million in dividends.
at this time, i like to turn the call over for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from matt pfau. please go ahead.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. allan, i wanted to just follow up on, you know, what you're seeing in the business over the past month or so as some of the variants -- the delta variant has started to pick up in the us. has that impacted purchasing decision or ability to close business at all? 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
first of all, matt, thanks for joining us. yeah, great question. we have not seen that emerge as a change. i think the -- probably one of the contributing factors is people had anticipated coming back to the office about this time, you know, september, october were the announced dates.
so, they were -- while the infection rate has started to climb, i think what's really happened is people are still working from home, so really, nothing changed over the prior periods. so, the answer to the question is no, we haven't seen a change in the pattern. we can stay at this level, and we don't go into economic shutdown like we did a year ago, then and i don't anticipate that we'll see that. i think we'll -- everyone's learned how to operate virtually.
so, we're feeling good about the continued growth in the pipeline and our ability to close. and, you know, what we really saw, matt, was the summer vacation period was a little stronger than we anticipated. people, i think they were just exhausted and worn out after the pandemic, and they went to the beach. so -- but they're back.
they're back from the beach and folks are in school and back to work. so, we're seeing momentum pick back up.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. great. and then i wanted to ask two questions on the transformational deals. so, you know, first of all, in terms of the time it's taking to close them, is it as you would have expected and then your comments are just more about to get more regularity in closing those deals, you just need more in the pipeline? and then secondarily, how are, you know, some of the current supply chain issues, you know, impacting demand for transformational deals?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll reverse through those questions, second one first. we're definitely seeing more and more discussions coming up and projects getting initiated that are transformational in nature, and that's exciting news. at -- the close rates -- so on the first question, matt, the close rates are in line with what we've seen over many years around these kind of projects. you know, one of the challenges that have -- that exist today that maybe didn't exist before is just the ability to schedule people to get together where you could get a huddle in the hallway to do the -- some of the, you know -- get consensus.
but a project of this nature has always had a high level of scrutiny. and so, what we're seeing is the predictable nature of those is a little tricky. you know, they have good intentions. we have good intentions.
everybody's worked hard to get a project kicked off on a particular time period, and then they hit a little extra due diligence process from time to time. and that just takes one more cycle and might cost us, you know, weeks or a month or something like that. but not six months, not a year. but it's, you know -- but a week or a month makes a difference if you're talking at the end of the quarter.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
sure. sure. understood. next one i wanted to ask about was on the traceability solution and just an update on what you're seeing there.
and, you know, i assume that would be included in some of the corporate responsibility drivers that you discussed in your prepared remarks.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, for sure. we are seeing an acceleration in that area around corporate responsibility and traceability. we're seeing at -- a handful of those opportunities are, you know, in any given time period are coming into the pipeline as stand-alone, just tackling that issue. but we're also seeing embedded with these transformational projects where that's an important criterion they want to take into consideration.
so, it's a mix of embedded in some of the more strategic opportunities and a -- what i -- i guess what i characterized before, solving a particular business process area, this traceability would be in there. lots of discussion, lots of pipeline building, a lot of discussion on a lot of levels. what's interesting is we're driving some introductions in tackling things like a few of these opportunities are the legal department is showing up in the call to talk about their compliance and how they're going to deliver on their expectations. so, we're getting introduced to people we've never spoken before.
you know, i guess we've spoken to the legal department when it comes to the contract, but not around their business processes and things of that nature before. so, a lot of momentum building, and we're starting to see money spend -- we've seen money spent, and we're starting to see that really accelerate. now, i think there was just a maturing of that area for people to get their arms around, you know, what kind of money they'd need to spend and how soon do they need to spend it and how do they get on top of that. we are -- we're continuing to dialogue with the us customs, for instance, on how to address these needs across the marketplace.
there's a sincere interest there, and the regulations are going to continue. our perspective there is that the regulations are going to continue to tighten up and be more enforced and that could be a step-change in those investments.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. good to hear. thanks for taking my questions, guys. appreciate it. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
you got it. have a good afternoon, matt.
operator
and we will take our next question from zach cummins. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
great. hi, allan and vince. thanks for taking my questions here. allan, i know conversions are really a big theme of the last quarter.
i mean, it seems like the overall mix of acv kind of shifted back to new customers here in this quarter. but can you give us a sense of the interest that you're still seeing from customers potentially making that lift and shift over to a subscription type of solution? 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, for sure. we had -- we're seeing it continue to build momentum. in the first quarter, we signed contracts with three existing customers to shift. they weren't some of the largest ones that we've done, but that just shows a continuing trend.
so, we're seeing more of those as we go forward. and in this particular quarter, those three were pure lift and shift. so, no new functionality added. so, that's another interesting trend where in the past quarters, we were seeing generally those projects were tied to adding some functionality, doing something new, and then moving to the cloud as part of it.
so, an interesting twist, when we look at the pipeline forward, we're seeing more and more of that coming into play. so, we'll see that to continue to accelerate, zach.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and in terms of the professional services side, i mean, obviously, summer vacation period here a little lighter than anticipated. but i mean, with the strong project backlog that you have right now, i mean, do you have the necessary capacity in place to kind of handle the project load here in the coming quarters?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
we do. it's -- yeah. so, first of all, the -- you know, we saw growth in the year over year from our supply chain business. so, that was positive.
we thought that we were going to get to even higher level of growth. but we did have some of those projects that we had signed in the fourth quarter, we had the -- as we all know, we hit -- we had quite a few of those coming in as we got to the end of the fourth quarter. they just didn't get going as fast as we anticipated. it was related to the summer vacation issue that i mentioned a few minutes ago.
i guess it was a blessing that people took some time off. but it had an impact on those starts. so, we're up and running on those projects now. we have added capacity.
we've hired into the team. but more importantly, we've also added capacity through our partners. we've got additional sis that we've onboarded and done training with. and they're certified or ready to go to work and are working on some of the projects.
so, in addition to the staff that we've put on, they've been able to onboard and train some folks. so, we have ample capacity at this point to fulfill the anticipated demand. and we haven't given up yet on both hiring and onboarding additional si capacity and continuing the certification process there.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and final question for me, it might be geared more toward vince. but a really strong subscription gross margin performance in the quarter.
i mean, how should we think about this as a sustainable rate going forward? i know subscription growth appears poised to grow at a pretty strong rate this year. i mean, what sort of leverage can we see in the model in that subscription gross margin line?
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
yeah, zach. we -- as we indicated last year, we did anticipate as we came into this year, we would see a pickup on it. so, coming in at roughly 75% after amortization of cap software, we do anticipate it's staying at this level, maybe for a quarter or two, and then start ticking up a little bit more. so -- but -- and start approaching 80% maybe at the back half of this year or early -- the next year.
zach cummins -- b. riley securities -- analyst
understood. well, thanks again for taking my questions, and then congrats on solid first-quarter results.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, zach. thanks for joining us.

[operator instructions] we'll move next to matthew galinko. please go ahead.
matthew galinko -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my question. i have one for you. among the strategic deals you're talking about, i'm curious what you're displacing and what the supply chain planning, you know, software and infrastructure looks like that you're displacing or looking to displace?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
a little bit of everything, matthew. it's a variety. one of the -- probably one of the most prominent thing, we were talking about it just earlier today actually. sap is continuing to falter in this space and underdeliver.
so, technically, answering the question, what we find oftentimes is we're going in there and there's a declared, you know, we're using sap, but in reality, the users are using excel. so, i'm not sure which one i would declare i'm replacing. am i replacing sap or at least the perception of sap, but replacing excel in many ways. but what we're finding is that in these transformational projects, in particular, we could be replacing four or five different applications, and that's one of the challenges that those companies have is that it's not one seamless platform that they can use for decision making across the organization, across their supply chain.
so, what happens is they get a lot of latency and information flow. they have disparate teams that are trying to make decisions and not working from the same perspective. and that's causing some of the challenges that are -- that persist in the supply chain today. so, we may be replacing any one of our competitors and the best of breed, in some cases, and then suddenly erp applications and spreadsheets and everything else all in one robot.
so, it's generally not a one-for-one replacement in these kind of projects. but the erp systems are commonly being looked at as not fulfilling the need and being shoved aside in favor of a transformational project or a best-of-breed solution. and in most cases, legacy platform applications that are out there that they're just consolidating onto a single platform now.

thank you, chloe, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's second quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i will review the numbers, but first, our safe harbor statement. this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy.
any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call.
such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services and the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. at this time, i will turn the call over to allan for our opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. with the first half of our fiscal year behind us, i'm pleased to report that we have achieved double-digit revenue growth in our supply chain management segment each of the past two quarters. and in the second quarter, our total revenue growth also returned to the double digits. our strong top-line performance was accompanied by significant expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin, which is now approaching the levels we last saw when we had more material contribution from license fees.
although our services revenue may cause some variation in any given quarter, we believe our recent growth and margin profile will increasingly be the norm, as we continue to scale our cloud business. looking back on this past quarter, we exited summer and with the pandemic starting to ease, the transition back to the in-person activities began to accelerate. however, with the fragmented work environments, business uncertainty and the frenzied activities our customers are engaged in to address their supply chain issues, especially with the holiday period upon us, we experienced delays in the completion of several contracts. we have since secured one of the more significant opportunities, and we remain actively engaged in several others, which should come to conclusion soon.
overall, our pipeline continues to increase, driven by the transformational projects required to enable enterprises to holistically manage their supply chains in a sustainable and economically resilient way. although the timing of closing these contracts is a little less predictable due to longer approval processes and the relative scarcity of customer resources required to initiate projects, we remain confident that between a larger opportunity set and improved execution, we are poised for a strong second half. in regard to our second quarter results, i'm pleased to announce that we extended our post pandemic year-over-year improvements on all measures. with increased rpo and lower churn than we were experiencing a year ago, we continued to build our acv and services backlogs.
we continue to focus on serving existing customers, delivering on our implementation commitments, and bringing new companies into our customer community, and we are doing it all more efficiently than ever before. with the post summer rebound in consulting services, we were on plan or slightly ahead across all revenue and margin areas. we are seeing a continued increase in our services backlog and are relying more and more on our si partners to assist in the delivery. the third quarter is always a challenge with extended downtime for the holidays.
however, we anticipate continued year-over-year growth and margin expansion in the supply chain consulting services business. we're also pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which now represents approximately 63% of total revenues, compared to 62% in the same period last year. this was driven by the 43% increase in cloud services acv we saw in the second quarter when compared to last year's second quarter. with the increase in new subscription contracts and a return to the more traditional stability of our cloud and on-prem customer community, we expect to see the recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue continue to rise.
during the second quarter, we welcomed five new customers and completed subscription or license fee transactions in six countries, reflecting our strong global presence. in summary, we're pleased with the second quarter results and expect to extend the performance improvements of our financial model through the second half of the fiscal year. we remain intently focused on executing against our growing pipeline and look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. at this time, i'll turn the call over to vince, who will provide the details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, allan. for the second quarter of fiscal '22, total revenues were $31.2 million, and that's an increase of 12% from 27.9% in the same period last year. the big driver of that is subscription fees, which increased 49% year over year to $10.4 million, while license revenue was $0.8 million, compared to $0.5 million the same period last year. our cloud services annual contract value, or acv, increased 44% to $42.5 million versus $29.6 million a year ago.
while we added $1.6 million in net new acv during the quarter, we were short of our internal target as a couple of large deals were expected to close -- that were expected to close were delayed. as allan mentioned, one of those has since closed, providing a nice start to q3. over 40% of our net new acv in the second quarter was from new customers. we added five new customers in the second quarter and bringing us to a total of 10 year to date.
looking at professional services, that increased 5% to $10.8 million from $10.2 million a year ago. our year-over-year increase reflects a 4% increase in the proven method, our it consulting business unit, and that was due to timing of project work and a 6% increase in our supply chain business unit. and our backlog of supply chain implementations increased significantly due to the increase in acv bookings in recent quarters. so, we anticipate continued year-over-year growth in our services during the remaining quarters of fiscal '22.
our maintenance revenues declined 9% year over year to $9.3 million, which includes a combination of cancellations and cloud conversions, reflecting a normal fall off rate this quarter. our total recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 63% of our total revenues in the second quarter, and that's up from 62% in the same period last year. our gross margin was 59% for the current period versus 53% in the same period last year. our subscription fee margin increased to 67%, compared to 58% in the prior-year period, and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense.
excluding the noncash amortization of cap software expense of $690,000 in the second quarter, our subscription gross margin would have been 74% versus 71% in the same period last year. and the amortization of cap software was $921,000 in the prior-year period. our license fee margin was 75%, compared to a negative 23% in the same period last year, and that's due to lower costs, such as amortization expense of $258,000 and amortization of cap software expense of $174,000 and var agent commissions of $61,000. services margin increased to 31% from 26% last year, and that's due to -- primarily due to a mix of revenue from higher-margin supply chain business unit and better utilization of the supply chain staff.
maintenance margin was 81% for both the current period and prior-year period. gross r&d expenses were 14% of total revenues for the current-year period, compared to 16% in the same period last year. we are in a transition period with our r&d in preparation for increasing the gross r&d spend in future periods to sustain spend as a percentage of supply chain revenue in this range. sales and marketing expenses were 19% for both the current and prior-year period.
g&a expenses were 18% of total revenues, compared to 16% last year, primarily due to higher variable compensation expense given our strong revenue and adjusted ebitda performance throughout the first half of the year. so, on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 326% to $2.7 million for this quarter, compared to $0.6 million in the same period a year ago. net income increased 379% to $3.3 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.10, compared to net income of $0.7 million or $0.02 earnings per diluted share last year. on an adjusted basis, which excludes noncash amortization of intangible expense related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased 137% to $3.8 million, compared to $1.6 million in the same period last year.
adjusted ebitda increased 70% to $4.8 million from $2.8 million in the same period last year, and adjusted net income increased 173% to $4.2 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 for the second quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $1.5 million or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.05 in the same period last year. international revenues this quarter were approximately 15% of total revenues for the current and prior-year periods. taking a look at the numbers year to date, total revenues increased 10% year over year to $60.5 million, and that's primarily due to a 51% increase in subscription fees to $20.1 million, a 5% increase in license fees and a 1% increase in services, partially offset by a 9% decline in maintenance revenues. adjusted operating income year to date was $6.4 million, representing an operating margin of 11%, compared to $3.3 million or 6% margin for the same period last year.
adjusted ebitda was $8.4 million versus $5.9 million in the year-ago period, and adjusted net income totaled $7.8 million or $0.23 per diluted share, up from 4.3% or 13% diluted share in the same period last year. our remaining performance obligation, which we refer to as backlog was $123 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 58%. the strong growth in rpo reflects record bookings in recent quarters and an increase in the duration of the cloud agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to our platform. looking at our balance sheet, our overall financial position remains strong with cash and investments of approximately $111.4 million at the end of the quarter.
this is an increase of approximately $16.7 million, compared to the same time last year. our days sales outstanding as of october 31, 2021, was 65 days for the current period, and that compares to 69 days in the same period last year, and this decrease was primarily due to improved collections compared to last year. and also, during the quarter, we paid $3.7 million in dividends. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to questions.

hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. first one, to start off with the deals that got pushed in the quarter. it would be helpful if you could just provide a little bit more detail on what exactly went on there. and then, i know you closed one, but the ones that haven't signed yet, what's your confidence level in getting those deals across and either your third or fourth quarter?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
matt, this is allan. i'll take that one. thank you for joining us this evening. it was a situation that i would describe as frustrating, but not necessarily disappointing.
personally got involved in many of those contracts and the evaluation. the team really did a phenomenal job of getting things ready and contracts got negotiated, and they were sitting ready for final approvals on more than the couple that we mentioned prior, so a handful, actually. and we just couldn't get the final approvals done, one of those have come through already and another one probably yet this evening or in the next couple of days and a few more next week, hopefully before thanksgiving even kicks in. so, we're hard at work at those.
again, i would describe it as frustrating, not so much disappointing only because of the hard work that went into it and on both sides, the customer side and with our team as well. so, a high degree of confidence, we feel good about those. we still got them in the works, not a lot of work to do on many of them because we're really waiting on the customer side. and just a couple of things that seem to really play out for us were around the work conditions, where people are not in the office, so it's not as easy to walk down the hallway and wrangle the group together and get the approvals necessary.
and then in a couple of cases, they're just really struggling with the resource requirements, but we figured out ways to get that behind us as well. so, feel really good, really good about getting those contracts wrapped up.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe it'd be helpful if you could give us a little bit in terms of the magnitude. you said they were large deals.
if you would close those, at least the ones that you had planned on closing, would you have been sort of closer to somewhere around a $3 million sequential acv increase?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
plus, a little bit higher.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. good to hear. ok. and then on the press release, you commented, allan, on sustainability becoming a bigger factor in terms of customer, what they're demanding out there or where they're investing, maybe just some more detail on that would be helpful, as well as what you're seeing in your traceability solution?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, for sure. it's really become, from a dialogue standpoint, a frenzied one. there's a lot of challenges around capturing the appropriate data. we've got one of our team members, mark burstein, is well known in the circles around this area, really set the standards in working with the customs organization and others.
it's still hard at work on some of those standards, probably the biggest challenge is data validation and making sure that the information gathered, and the processes put in place are verifiable and that they'll be capable of still getting their products into both the u.s. and in the european union. so, a lot of collaborative work going on there, which has really been amazing to me to see how well competitive companies have come together to really work on this issue. so, it is a hot topic.
it's the front of everyone's mind. for all the right reasons, people are working hard at it, and we see that that's going to be a strong topic in the months and quarters and years to come, as people really get their arms around it, get it tackled. and as that starts to play out, i think the regulations are going to get tighter and tighter and consumer expectations are going to get even more demanding. so, i believe, matt, we're just at the beginning stages of that really playing out.
matt pfau -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks a lot, guys, for taking my questions. i'll pass the line.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
for sure. thanks for joining us again.
operator
and we'll move next to zach cummins. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yeah. hi. good afternoon, vince and allan. thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong performance across the p&l in the quarter.
just digging a little further, allan, in terms of what's in the pipeline for you? how do you guys think about the opportunity for conversions with existing customers versus new customers coming into the fold in terms of an acv perspective?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great question. historically, for many, many years, and it still exists today, where if you look at a trend over time, roughly 50% of our contract business comes from both, from the new customers and from the existing customers. the newer projects tend to be, in general, tend to be a little larger, because you're starting from scratch, and you're adding a handful of components into the mix there.
whereas, in general, the existing customer community, maybe adding a couple of things or one thing or expanding a division or something like that. but with that said, some of those larger transactions can be existing customers as well. in fact, the one that we've closed this quarter already is from an existing customer that was a holdover from last period. so, it's a mix.
but in general, you can say that the new customer projects are a little bigger. but overall revenue is -- or revenue that's driven by those contracts is about split on the long trend. does that answer the question, zach?
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yeah, that's extremely helpful. and in regards to the press release you had out this morning in terms of consolidating resources across logility, demand management and ngc. i mean, you can just talk about the decision and why you feel like now is the right time to do that and kind of what you're hoping to achieve by making this move?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
well, a good friend of mine always says, zach, that every once in a while, you want to be lucky. and sometimes, you got to be smart, and you got to be lucky. and when those two hit together, you really hit the mark. and i believe that we were smart and lucky on this one.
we started this transition three and a half, four years ago. we started by talking about what do we need to do with the collective capabilities we have in our software platform, and we began, in parallel with the transition to the cloud a number of years ago to say, when we do that, let's make this platform all one, because we had complementary capabilities across all of the business units we had -- four at that time with ngc, demand management, logility and the halo operation that we had acquired just prior to that. so, our team went hard to work at it. the pandemic over the last 18 months has really demonstrated why that was a brilliant decision.
it was in mind, so i'm not saying i'm brilliant. but as an organization, we've got some great people here that were thinking hard about the future supply chain and what we needed to do to help our customers be more successful. we didn't have any idea that the pandemic was coming. but the reality of the pandemic set in motion, the things that we knew were on the horizon, as the pace of supply chains continue to accelerate, the length of products in the marketplace, time in markets is getting shorter and shorter, thus the turnover and the number of new product introductions going faster and faster, the global enterprises.
and what it really meant was in order to be successful, our customers had to start breaking down the silos. so, we were structured around the silos of the past and the way our customers operate their supply chains, and we serve those markets very well. in today's marketplace, that's unacceptable. you got to break those barriers down.
we have our customers, who are rethinking the way they operate their supply chain. they're synchronizing their teams around product lines or customer experience or divisions. they no longer have forecasting teams and sourcing teams and procurement teams that operate in silos and independent of each other. so, our business today is aligned with the necessary needs of it.
and we were fortunate to not have to be tackling that today, where we already got it behind us. the last leg of that journey was to align our organization in such a way that we could really capitalize on that as well. and our demand management team is acutely focused on emerging markets and small to medium enterprises and our logility team is acutely focused on the needs of large enterprises. and that's how we set our business structure up to align with our product capabilities.
so, probably a heck of a longer answer than you wanted, zach, is when you asked that question, but that's the story. and hopefully, that was helpful.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
extremely helpful. i always appreciate the additional insight on that front. and just final question for me, geared toward vince. in terms of the subscription margin, it's remained pretty steady here in kind of the mid-70s.
i guess, how should we be thinking about that going forward, as the subscription piece of the business continues to scale?
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
yeah, zach. we're thinking it will trend slightly up toward the end of this -- back half of the year. it's roughly around 74% -- bouncing around 74%, 75%. it should tick up a couple of basis points, maybe toward like 76% and 77% toward the end of the year, but we're really targeting next year to get it to 80%.
so, that's kind of the way we're modeling it right now.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. well, thanks again for taking my questions, and best of luck going forward.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. thanks for joining us, zach.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll move next to matthew galinko. please go ahead.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. maybe firstly, on the transformational type deals. can you take a stab at whether in the velocity, picking up on getting those across the finish line or given where we are in the pandemic and where we are in sort of the global macro environment, what are the kind of puts and takes there?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. matt, first of all, thank you again for joining us. good question. the nature of supply chain today is really driving these transformational projects.
it's much like we were chatting a few minutes ago when zach asked the question about our realignment of our business. but those are the needs of the customers, they need to think differently. they need a platform for managing the supply chain, where they can do the scenario analysis and span across the whole end-to-end supply chain operations that they have. so, what that brings about is not only a software application and implementation, but it's a change management practice as well.
so, that's one of the headlines that we've been hitting into, and we've really worked hard at helping our customers figure out how to do that to the tune of several projects we have up and running today, where we have some of our consultants sitting on the customer side, really operating on their behalf, helping them operate the day-to-day operations, so that they can free up some of the key resources to help on the project. so, we're thinking outside the box, we're doing some nontraditional work. it's starting to break those projects loose. we're serving that idea up to more of the prospects, as we go forward.
so, that, combined with the results we're getting, i believe we're going to see that break loose. now, the next couple of months are really tricky as we get into the holidays with thanksgiving here in the united states and christmas around the world. but that said, we're in a period that is traditionally strong for us, because we have three milestone moments. we have the end of the calendar year, where money needs to get spent, because that's the end of many of our customers' fiscal year, the start of a new year, people come out of the blocks with a fresh rest from christmas and new year's and a desire to get back to work and new fiscal budgets that can free up some cash.
and then, of course, 30 days later, we have the end of our quarter, and we've done a marvelous job over 40 years of training our customers at the end of the quarter is a good time to do work with us. so, we have those three milestone events that should be another breakthrough quarter for us, where we stand out in the third quarter.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
got it. thanks. that's very helpful. maybe just one more on the competitive front, what you're seeing, given some of the consolidation that's played out in the space.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's been an interesting time in this space. i think there's a couple of consolidations that have just taken some folks out of the play. not all companies have been successfully gobbling up some of the things that they spend money on and really put into effective use. so, we've actually seen a few competitors to disappear from the horizon or solutions they would be, disappear from the horizon.
overall, the more prominent players that we peer up against blue yonder, who just went through a change in ownership structure with panasonic, taking them private under their umbrella. we've yet to see really that start to come about, although we've seen few more resumes hitting the street. so, we'll see what that means, as time plays out. we continue to see the erp players.
they get some business, where they lock up the cfo and the cio, and they want to have a single solution, but they're continuing to falter, and we're seeing more breakaway clients, who historically had been loyal to those brands, stepping away and reassessing what they need to manage their supply chain, and that's become more prominent than a brand loyalty. so, that's starting to break lose some projects for us. so, there's a handful of our -- the best-of-breed providers out there that stand side by side with us. we're all getting our fair share today and i think the collective of the top three or four were probably taking more business from some of the others, who are as strong and can't help the customers, as well as they have the desire and need to transform their business.
so, it's a healthy environment. we like the position we're in, and we can compete very effectively.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results. [operator instructions] please note, today's call may be recorded, and i will be standing by should you need any assistance. it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to the cfo of american software, vince klinges. please go ahead.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, chloe, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i will review the numbers. but first, our safe harbor statement.
this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements.
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call. such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there could be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to allan for opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. i'm pleased to report that, again, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in our supply chain segment. and for the company as a whole, it was the second quarter of double-digit growth with q3 accelerating well up into the teens. our strong top line performance was accompanied by significant expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin as we gained efficiency from the cloud growth and achieved very high utilization rates across all of our services segments including the it consultancy business which is very project and seasonally sensitive.
we anticipate continued strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter and fiscal year '23 with the additional scale in the cloud business and a healthy backlog of project work in hand. however, ebitda expansion will be tempered in the quarter and year ahead as we continue to invest in employee retention, expanding the team and with a higher level of in-person events and travel expected. in spite of a very competitive labor market especially in the supply chain and technical space we successfully onboarded about a dozen people so far this calendar year, filling the needs, hiring demands across sales, marketing, services, cloud operations and in r&d. we expect to repeat that pace of hiring in the next few months to fulfill the needs of expected growth in the year ahead.
and then we'll also need to keep that pace up in the first half of fiscal '23 to align to our business plan for next year. looking back on the past quarter, the lingering impact of the pandemic and world events have extended the fragmented working environments, business uncertainty and frenzied activities our customers are engaged in to address their supply chain issues. we continue to see delays in contract approvals as the supply chain and it organizations grapple with staffing shortages. we were able to secure the two larger projects that slipped from q2 early in q3.
however, in spite of some progress due to our prescriptive approach and staff augmentation efforts, we anticipate that some delays may persist for several more quarters. overall, our pipeline continues to increase, driven by the transformational projects required to enable enterprises to holistically manage their supply chains in a sustainable and economically resilient way. although the timing of closing these contracts is a little less predictable due to the longer approval processes, we remain confident that between a larger opportunity set and our improved execution, we're poised for a strong conclusion to the fiscal year and carry over into the first half of fiscal '23. due to sequential improvement in our closing rate and our ongoing efforts on customer retention, i'm pleased to announce that we increased our rpo and continue to build our acv and services backlog.
our team is focused on serving existing customers, delivering on our implementation commitments and bringing new companies into our customer community more efficiently than ever before. we're seeing a continued increase in our services backlog and are relying more and more on our si partners to assist in delivery. with the holiday period behind us, we anticipate continued high utilization rates across all services teams, which will deliver year-over-year growth and margin expansion in the supply chain consulting services business. we are also pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which now represents approximately 63% of our total revenues year-to-date, compared to 62% in the same period last year.
this was driven by a 43% increase in the cloud services acv we saw in the third quarter when compared to last year's third quarter. with the increase in new subscription contracts and the continued stability of our cloud and on-prem customer community, we expect to see the recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue continue to rise. during the third quarter, we welcomed four new customers and completed subscription or license fee transactions in 10 countries, reflecting our strong global presence. in summary, we're pleased with the third quarter results and expect to extend the performance improvements of our financial model through the remainder of this fiscal year and into next year.
while q4 is shaping up to be the strongest quarter of net new acv addition of this year, it is not likely to be the standout quarter like we had fourth quarter last year, which benefited from the accumulation of four slow quarters through the initial pandemic period and culminated in the closure of two large acv contracts in excess of $1 million. we remain intently focused on executing against our growing pipeline and look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. so at this time, i'll turn the call back over to vince, who will provide the details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thanks allan. for the third quarter of fiscal '22 total revenues were $32.4 million at 17% increase from $27.7 million the same period last year. what's driving that is subscription fees which increased 45% year over year to $10.9 million, while the software license revenue also increased 87% to $1 million, compared to $0.5 million in the same period last year. our acv or annual contract value increased 43% to $45.3 million versus $31.6 million a year ago period.
we added $2.8 million of net new acv during the quarter. over 40% of our net new acv was from new customers. professional services and other revenues increased 21% to $11.4 million from $9.5 million a year ago. the year-over-year increase reflects a 29% increase in our it consulting business unit, a proven method.
and that's due to timing of project work and also, we had a 13% increase of our scm business unit also due to increase in project work. maintenance revenues declined 10% year over year to $9.1 million, reflecting our normal falloff rate this quarter. so total revenues -- recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 62% of total revenues. that compares to 64% in the same period last year.
our gross margin was 58% for the current period, and that's up from 55% in the same period last year. subscription fee margin increased to 68%, compared to 59% in the same period last year. and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense. excluding the noncash amortization of cap software expense of $628,000 for the third quarter, our gross -- our subscription gross margin would have been 74% versus 71% in the same period last year.
and the amortization of cap software last year was $866,000 in the prior year period. license fee margin increased to 76%, compared to 46% in the same period last year, and that's primarily due to higher revenues and lower amortization expenses. our services margin increased to 30%, compared to 24% last year due to strong growth in our -- both our it staffing business, the proven method, as well as a higher margin supply chain business unit. our maintenance margin was 80% for the third quarter, and that compares to 81% in the same period last year.
gross r&d expenses were 14% of total revenues for the current period, and that compares to 16% in the same period last year. our sales and marketing expenses were 16% of revenues for the current quarter, compared to 18% in the same period last year. and g&a expenses were 18% of total revenues for both periods. so on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 246% to $3.2 million this quarter, and that compares to $0.9 million in the same period last year.
so our net income increased 27% to $2.9 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.09, compared to net income of $2.3 million or $0.07 in earnings diluted share. on an adjusted basis, which excludes the noncash amortization of intangible expense-related acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased 153% to $4.4 million, compared to $1.7 million in the same period last year, and our adjusted ebitda increased 85% to $5.3 million from $2.9 million in the same period last year. adjusted net income was increased 28% to $3.8 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.11 for the third quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $3 million or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.09 the same period last year. international revenues this quarter were approximately 16% of total revenues, and that compares to 15% in the same period last year.
for year-to-date, for the nine-month period ended january 31, 2022. our total revenues increased 12% year over year to $92.9 million and that's primarily due to a 49% increase in subscription fees to $31 million, and a 30% increase in license fees and a 7% increase in services, partially offset by a 9% decline in revenues. so our adjusted operating income year-to-date was $10.8 million and representing an operating margin of 12%, compared to $5.1 million or 6% in the same period last year. our adjusted ebitda increased 57% to $13.8 million, compared to $8.8 million in the year ago period.
and that represents an adjusted ebitda margin of 15%. adjusted net income totaled $11.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share, up from $7.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the same period last year. we're excited this quarter with our remaining performance obligation, or rpo, which is -- which we refer to as backlog of $129 million, and it's representing a year-over-year increase of 61%. the strong growth in rpo reflects record bookings over the past 12 months and an increase in the duration of our cloud agreements as customers continue to make longer-term commitments to our platform.
taking a look at our balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with cash and investments of approximately $114.8 million at the end of the quarter, this is an increase of approximately $14 million compared to the same period last year. during the quarter we paid $3.7 million in dividends and our days sales outstanding as of january 31, 2022 was 77 days and that compares to 65 days the same period last year and this increase is primarily due to timing of billing and some delays in collections when compared to last year. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from matt pfau. please go ahead.
matt pfau
hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and good quarter. i wanted to follow up on the commentary around the deal delays and perhaps it would just be helpful to get a little bit more detail on what's going on there in terms of what the drivers are and then what needs to happen to return to a more normal cadence from a deal closure perspective?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, matt. [inaudible] thanks for the question. it really is getting driven by the staffing concerns that we have experienced now for a couple of quarters in a row where folks just don't have the resources to really get a project going. they've got adequate funding, they've got budget, they've got the ability to spend, they've got the desire to spend but until you can put boots on the ground, so to speak, they don't want to get committed to the contract.
so they're waiting until they get critical roles filled, people in place, free up their calendar and get those project started. those are -- those delays are little bit unpredictable, sometimes it's involving hiring on their side and there is labor shortage market that we're in, the time frame to get people hired and onboarded is a little unpredictable. so we had a couple of -- that's what happened to us at the end of q2 and extended some of those projects into the beginning of q3. we didn't have nearly the order of magnitude this quarter, but there were some that we anticipated getting done that just didn't come to completion in the third quarter, but we're working hard at getting them done here in the fourth quarter, and a couple -- made progress on a couple of those already.
so it's a little unpredictable. i think people get back to their office, which we're anticipating we're going to do later in the spring. and when folks get back and they are sitting around the table and can work on some of these topics in person. i think that will help bring some stability to it.
so with a good eye to it, matt, maybe this summer, we'll get more predictable.
matt pfau
great. that's very helpful. and then wanted to ask the concerns around inflation and then potential resulting slowdown in the economy have been out there for a while now. but what are you hearing from your clients on that front? are there any sort of economic concerns that are holding deals up and then, obviously, more recently with some geopolitical concerns, is that impacting pipeline or deal closures at all?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
no, not yet. the geopolitical stuff, as we all know, is pretty fresh. but over three decades that we've been working on this stuff, the best time for supply chain projects is when we're in a state of change. and we went from one that was booming and pandemic ridden to one that maybe the pendulum swung the other way in an awfully quick fashion.
but times have change, whether it's on the downward spiral or an upward trend are good for projects like ours because people are grappling with how to deal with whatever is going on in the marketplace. so i don't think we'll see any impact on the short term. if the economy really slows down and people tighten up spending, then it may be a longer-term impact. but nothing yet, matt, we haven't seen that come in as a topic of discussion yet.
matt pfau
got it. and last one for me. in the press release, you guys talked about sustainability initiatives that you have and ai and machine learning becoming more important to companies achieving those sustainability goals. maybe you could just expand on what you were referencing in the press release and what you're seeing in terms of sustainability initiatives driving demand for your software?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so forever, the supply chains have really been driven by economic delivery of goods, how to get the products to the right place at the lowest possible cost and make sure you get it there on time. that's been a long-term one. over the last five or six years it has been or maybe 10 years there has been a more focus on the environmental impact, which is one of the sustainability initiatives, what is the impact and as more and more visibility comes to that, it's been less economic driven and which is part of the environmental process, but more around just looking at the impact on the global environment.
so people are more adamant about that and then a more recent issue has really come up around the use of labor and proper labor standards around the world. so that's an important initiative. our traceability product that we announced and have deployed several times now. we announced it earlier in the year and has really been getting -- taking hold.
people are acting on it now. the regulations are coming into play. people get -- the customers are getting a handle on what they need to be able to do, and we're helping them overcome some of those challenges so that they can look back through the supply chain and make sure that their products are being sourced responsibly and with proper labor standards. so it's really come about.
it's driving some initiatives. there are a number of stand-alone opportunities that we're working on that are on this traceability component alone, and people are really trying to address those needs and be responsible providers of products to the marketplace.
matt pfau
great. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sir. appreciate it.
operator
and we'll take our next question from zach cummins. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yeah. hi, good afternoon. congrats on the strong results here in q3. allan, i just wanted to touch a little bit more on some of the challenges you're seeing with getting deals across the finish line and through these approval processes.
it sounds like some of the ones that were delayed in q2 have now moved into q3, and we're able to close some of those. but i was curious what you've really seen so far in q4 and what's really kind of given you the confidence that you can still execute in this environment and put up the strongest acv quarter here to end the year?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've got several contracts already under our belt. we've got them executed. so we're not quite all the way through the first month, but we're getting there.
and then just the magnitude of pipeline and the number of transactions in the phase we're in with those folks, zach, relative to getting contracts negotiated and the timing and the sequence of events to get projects kicked off, a lot of movement going on there. so unless we get into something really crazy, which maybe will -- that always could happen. but it's just the momentum play that's out there, the deals that are already done, the momentum play that we have around the ones that are very, very active right now and timing fairly short term to get contracts completed give us strong confidence that we'll be able to hit that level of performance.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and just considering some of the staffing shortages you're seeing at some of your end customers and the delay of some of the project timelines here. is this really causing any sort of differentiated approach in how you go about trying to close some of these deals? is that more of a focus on the existing base and trying to expand upon those relationships? i'm just curious how you guys are really trying to navigate through this challenging deal closing environment.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've done a couple of things. i wouldn't say we haven't changed our focus to internal more predominantly, but our existing customers more predominantly but we have some great projects underway with existing customers. they're dealing with one or the same issues that others -- traceability is a great example that most of that work is with existing customers where they're expanding their footprint, trying to make sure that they've got good labor practices in place.
but -- so a couple of things we've done relative to the staffing challenges they're facing, we're putting forward proposals that we're offering up the labor to help backfill and support steps in the project that may otherwise historically been done by the customer. we're putting forward a statement of work that is very prescriptive and trying to minimize the impact on their labor internally so that we can get those projects moving relative to the burden that's on the customers to get that done. we can't do it stand-alone. we still need time from the client in order to really effectively deploy a solution.
but we're trying to minimize the impact on their existing staff and minimizing the amount of work that they have to put in any given week. so we're taking a couple of those actions to make sure we get there. and then the other thing we've done, and we've talked about this a couple of times, is really just breaking up the project into smaller bite-sized chunks. the customers feel better about taking a smaller project, if they're looking at something that's going to be 18 months or 12 to 18 months to deploy, they're a little more hesitant and there are lot more scrutiny going into launching those projects.
so we've taken a path to say, let's break it up, what's the most important thing that we can do first that will give you the biggest return on their investment and minimize the impact and get a project going. so we're going to see that play out in a few less million-plus transactions. that was my comment earlier. we had several of those in the fourth quarter of last year.
there's a chance that we won't have any of those or maybe one of those this quarter. but we're going to have a higher flow of deals by getting them broken loose and getting the commitments. so hopefully, i covered that point for you, zach.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
absolutely. i appreciate all the additional color on that front, so thank you for that. and final question from me, allan, is really around the planned investments that you talked about during the script, whether that be more in-person events that you're hosting, more travel from your internal team and even just hiring additional people. i mean can you talk about, is there any particular area that you're looking to bolster your headcount and kind of what are some of the ways you're looking to attract talent in what's been a pretty tough hiring environment?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. a couple of things. there are going to be more in-person events it appears. so marketing and customer conference events, those kinds of things are coming back.
people have flipped them to be in-person. a few of our investor and analyst conferences we've gone in-person. so did get me back on the airplane as well, looking forward to it by the way. but -- so that's going to happen.
we're not going to get back and i don't anticipate through the first half of next year, we'll go back to the level that we were prior to the pandemic. but certainly, they were almost nonexistent in the last two years, a very minimal travel, mostly internal travel. but people are back on site. they're welcoming us back on site.
so we're getting more and more engagements going on there. but the bigger impact is really going to be our investment in the organization. we have -- in order to support our business plan, we need to expand in every area. as we bring more subscription business in, we need -- we're getting scale out of the cloud business, but we still need more head count in our cloud business to support them.
we've got some strong plans in r&d that we really want to expand our footprint. we think there are some elements to invest in that requires people to go develop our applications a little deeper in some of these areas. so we're going to be expanding our r&d investment as well. we're going to keep that in line with our revenue growth as a percent of investment back in r&d, but that means we got to bring more headcount in in order to do that.
we're expanding our sales team globally. we're expanding in every region. we're adding some staff here in north america. we're expanding into asia.
we're expanding into europe, continuing there. so we've got headcount addition, we want to pull into that area. in order to support that, we got marketing investment we needed to make. and our backlog of services business, even though we can rely on our sis, -- even when the sis are doing a predominance of the work, there's individuals we need from our team to support them in their implementation process.
so we're going to be staffing up in our services business. so there's not an area of our business that's untouched from that investment standpoint. the second half of your question was why are we successfully able to compete? well, first of all, i think people love this space. the fact that supply chain is a thriving, growing business they want to be part of that.
supply chains have an impact on the world. we feel good. the people -- our team members feel good about what we do through our customers to impact the world we live in. traceability, sustainability, environmental impact by improving the efficiency through our customers.
those are all exciting things to do. we've got a great culture here at the company. longevity is -- of our staff is evidence of a good working environment. so -- and then we're very competitive on our compensation structure.
so we're able to attract people. they're coming in. they want to be part of our team. and so far, we've been successful at filling the open roles we have.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. it's really helpful. i appreciate you taking my questions, and best of luck here in the coming quarter.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
all right, zach. thank you very much for joining us this afternoon.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll move next to anja soderstrom. please go ahead.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations for a great quarter. firstly, i'm curious, you're talking about a lot of hiring and you're successful in attracting talent. but how do you see the wage inflation playing in and how are you going to be able to offset that or absorb that?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, the inflation certainly is in there and well deserved. the right talent deserves to have a requisite compensation, anja, so good question in that. we have no choice but to make sure that people are fairly compensated. so we're going to step up to the plate, make sure that happens.
that's going to have an impact. but the bottom line is that as we grow the business, we get scale through our efficiency. our services team, for instance, is working really hard at trying to improve the efficiency of the work we do with our customers. this prescriptive methodology helps.
so even though on a dollar-for-dollar basis, we have to make sure we've got fair compensation out there. we can get a lot more work done through those efficiency factors. in our cloud business, we're getting scale just through the natural deployment. it's not a one-for-one on expanding our customer base on a cost basis.
so even though we have higher cost from inflation, on where we do spend the money, we get scale through our efficiencies in the cloud business. so we think it's a balanced budget. we can't, as i mentioned in my commentary earlier, we don't anticipate that we can grow ebitda at the same pace that we did last year because of some of these investments we're making. but not all of that's inflation, some of that is just getting out over in advance of the business model to get -- we get salespeople on board this -- in the next couple of quarters.
they're going to have an impact in the longer term. it takes six to nine months for them to be fully productive. so we want to make the investment now. we'll put the money down and we'll get a return on that investment.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's a good color. and then also curious about the partnerships you mentioned in your press release.
can you just speak a little bit about what we can expect from those and give us more color on that?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good follow up question. the partners we have are really getting close with us and working hard to getting customers success, we're very much aligned with them on the objectives of the project. they are seeing the world the same way we are. that efficiency and effectiveness of getting projects up and running and getting systems deployed is important.
so we have very good alignment with their objectives, our objectives and the prospect objectives. we've done some pretty good investments in getting education and onboarding process going so that consultants are getting trained and certified ready to go. so that's been exciting. they are willing to put the investment in there to get them -- to get them educated so that they can be very effective when they are on the job.
so nice synergies, they are introducing us to new opportunities as well that we weren't otherwise aware of, so that's a nice spin-off of that. but the primary effect is that we're successfully getting customers up and running and live. and that bodes well for tackling phase 2, which is really the objective for breaking up these projects that we get phase 1 up and running and do that efficiently and effectively. then phase 2 comes along much quicker and that's an exciting part of our growth model.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you. that was all for me.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, anja. have a good afternoon. evening for you, by the way.

2022-Q3,AMSWA,2022-02-23 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results. [operator instructions] please note, today's call may be recorded, and i will be standing by should you need any assistance. it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to the cfo of american software, vince klinges. please go ahead.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, chloe, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i will review the numbers. but first, our safe harbor statement.
this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements.
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call. such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there could be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to allan for opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. i'm pleased to report that, again, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in our supply chain segment. and for the company as a whole, it was the second quarter of double-digit growth with q3 accelerating well up into the teens. our strong top line performance was accompanied by significant expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin as we gained efficiency from the cloud growth and achieved very high utilization rates across all of our services segments including the it consultancy business which is very project and seasonally sensitive.
we anticipate continued strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter and fiscal year '23 with the additional scale in the cloud business and a healthy backlog of project work in hand. however, ebitda expansion will be tempered in the quarter and year ahead as we continue to invest in employee retention, expanding the team and with a higher level of in-person events and travel expected. in spite of a very competitive labor market especially in the supply chain and technical space we successfully onboarded about a dozen people so far this calendar year, filling the needs, hiring demands across sales, marketing, services, cloud operations and in r&d. we expect to repeat that pace of hiring in the next few months to fulfill the needs of expected growth in the year ahead.
and then we'll also need to keep that pace up in the first half of fiscal '23 to align to our business plan for next year. looking back on the past quarter, the lingering impact of the pandemic and world events have extended the fragmented working environments, business uncertainty and frenzied activities our customers are engaged in to address their supply chain issues. we continue to see delays in contract approvals as the supply chain and it organizations grapple with staffing shortages. we were able to secure the two larger projects that slipped from q2 early in q3.
however, in spite of some progress due to our prescriptive approach and staff augmentation efforts, we anticipate that some delays may persist for several more quarters. overall, our pipeline continues to increase, driven by the transformational projects required to enable enterprises to holistically manage their supply chains in a sustainable and economically resilient way. although the timing of closing these contracts is a little less predictable due to the longer approval processes, we remain confident that between a larger opportunity set and our improved execution, we're poised for a strong conclusion to the fiscal year and carry over into the first half of fiscal '23. due to sequential improvement in our closing rate and our ongoing efforts on customer retention, i'm pleased to announce that we increased our rpo and continue to build our acv and services backlog.
our team is focused on serving existing customers, delivering on our implementation commitments and bringing new companies into our customer community more efficiently than ever before. we're seeing a continued increase in our services backlog and are relying more and more on our si partners to assist in delivery. with the holiday period behind us, we anticipate continued high utilization rates across all services teams, which will deliver year-over-year growth and margin expansion in the supply chain consulting services business. we are also pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which now represents approximately 63% of our total revenues year-to-date, compared to 62% in the same period last year.
this was driven by a 43% increase in the cloud services acv we saw in the third quarter when compared to last year's third quarter. with the increase in new subscription contracts and the continued stability of our cloud and on-prem customer community, we expect to see the recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue continue to rise. during the third quarter, we welcomed four new customers and completed subscription or license fee transactions in 10 countries, reflecting our strong global presence. in summary, we're pleased with the third quarter results and expect to extend the performance improvements of our financial model through the remainder of this fiscal year and into next year.
while q4 is shaping up to be the strongest quarter of net new acv addition of this year, it is not likely to be the standout quarter like we had fourth quarter last year, which benefited from the accumulation of four slow quarters through the initial pandemic period and culminated in the closure of two large acv contracts in excess of $1 million. we remain intently focused on executing against our growing pipeline and look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. so at this time, i'll turn the call back over to vince, who will provide the details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thanks allan. for the third quarter of fiscal '22 total revenues were $32.4 million at 17% increase from $27.7 million the same period last year. what's driving that is subscription fees which increased 45% year over year to $10.9 million, while the software license revenue also increased 87% to $1 million, compared to $0.5 million in the same period last year. our acv or annual contract value increased 43% to $45.3 million versus $31.6 million a year ago period.
we added $2.8 million of net new acv during the quarter. over 40% of our net new acv was from new customers. professional services and other revenues increased 21% to $11.4 million from $9.5 million a year ago. the year-over-year increase reflects a 29% increase in our it consulting business unit, a proven method.
and that's due to timing of project work and also, we had a 13% increase of our scm business unit also due to increase in project work. maintenance revenues declined 10% year over year to $9.1 million, reflecting our normal falloff rate this quarter. so total revenues -- recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 62% of total revenues. that compares to 64% in the same period last year.
our gross margin was 58% for the current period, and that's up from 55% in the same period last year. subscription fee margin increased to 68%, compared to 59% in the same period last year. and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense. excluding the noncash amortization of cap software expense of $628,000 for the third quarter, our gross -- our subscription gross margin would have been 74% versus 71% in the same period last year.
and the amortization of cap software last year was $866,000 in the prior year period. license fee margin increased to 76%, compared to 46% in the same period last year, and that's primarily due to higher revenues and lower amortization expenses. our services margin increased to 30%, compared to 24% last year due to strong growth in our -- both our it staffing business, the proven method, as well as a higher margin supply chain business unit. our maintenance margin was 80% for the third quarter, and that compares to 81% in the same period last year.
gross r&d expenses were 14% of total revenues for the current period, and that compares to 16% in the same period last year. our sales and marketing expenses were 16% of revenues for the current quarter, compared to 18% in the same period last year. and g&a expenses were 18% of total revenues for both periods. so on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 246% to $3.2 million this quarter, and that compares to $0.9 million in the same period last year.
so our net income increased 27% to $2.9 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.09, compared to net income of $2.3 million or $0.07 in earnings diluted share. on an adjusted basis, which excludes the noncash amortization of intangible expense-related acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased 153% to $4.4 million, compared to $1.7 million in the same period last year, and our adjusted ebitda increased 85% to $5.3 million from $2.9 million in the same period last year. adjusted net income was increased 28% to $3.8 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.11 for the third quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $3 million or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.09 the same period last year. international revenues this quarter were approximately 16% of total revenues, and that compares to 15% in the same period last year.
for year-to-date, for the nine-month period ended january 31, 2022. our total revenues increased 12% year over year to $92.9 million and that's primarily due to a 49% increase in subscription fees to $31 million, and a 30% increase in license fees and a 7% increase in services, partially offset by a 9% decline in revenues. so our adjusted operating income year-to-date was $10.8 million and representing an operating margin of 12%, compared to $5.1 million or 6% in the same period last year. our adjusted ebitda increased 57% to $13.8 million, compared to $8.8 million in the year ago period.
and that represents an adjusted ebitda margin of 15%. adjusted net income totaled $11.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share, up from $7.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the same period last year. we're excited this quarter with our remaining performance obligation, or rpo, which is -- which we refer to as backlog of $129 million, and it's representing a year-over-year increase of 61%. the strong growth in rpo reflects record bookings over the past 12 months and an increase in the duration of our cloud agreements as customers continue to make longer-term commitments to our platform.
taking a look at our balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with cash and investments of approximately $114.8 million at the end of the quarter, this is an increase of approximately $14 million compared to the same period last year. during the quarter we paid $3.7 million in dividends and our days sales outstanding as of january 31, 2022 was 77 days and that compares to 65 days the same period last year and this increase is primarily due to timing of billing and some delays in collections when compared to last year. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from matt pfau. please go ahead.
matt pfau
hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and good quarter. i wanted to follow up on the commentary around the deal delays and perhaps it would just be helpful to get a little bit more detail on what's going on there in terms of what the drivers are and then what needs to happen to return to a more normal cadence from a deal closure perspective?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, matt. [inaudible] thanks for the question. it really is getting driven by the staffing concerns that we have experienced now for a couple of quarters in a row where folks just don't have the resources to really get a project going. they've got adequate funding, they've got budget, they've got the ability to spend, they've got the desire to spend but until you can put boots on the ground, so to speak, they don't want to get committed to the contract.
so they're waiting until they get critical roles filled, people in place, free up their calendar and get those project started. those are -- those delays are little bit unpredictable, sometimes it's involving hiring on their side and there is labor shortage market that we're in, the time frame to get people hired and onboarded is a little unpredictable. so we had a couple of -- that's what happened to us at the end of q2 and extended some of those projects into the beginning of q3. we didn't have nearly the order of magnitude this quarter, but there were some that we anticipated getting done that just didn't come to completion in the third quarter, but we're working hard at getting them done here in the fourth quarter, and a couple -- made progress on a couple of those already.
so it's a little unpredictable. i think people get back to their office, which we're anticipating we're going to do later in the spring. and when folks get back and they are sitting around the table and can work on some of these topics in person. i think that will help bring some stability to it.
so with a good eye to it, matt, maybe this summer, we'll get more predictable.
matt pfau
great. that's very helpful. and then wanted to ask the concerns around inflation and then potential resulting slowdown in the economy have been out there for a while now. but what are you hearing from your clients on that front? are there any sort of economic concerns that are holding deals up and then, obviously, more recently with some geopolitical concerns, is that impacting pipeline or deal closures at all?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
no, not yet. the geopolitical stuff, as we all know, is pretty fresh. but over three decades that we've been working on this stuff, the best time for supply chain projects is when we're in a state of change. and we went from one that was booming and pandemic ridden to one that maybe the pendulum swung the other way in an awfully quick fashion.
but times have change, whether it's on the downward spiral or an upward trend are good for projects like ours because people are grappling with how to deal with whatever is going on in the marketplace. so i don't think we'll see any impact on the short term. if the economy really slows down and people tighten up spending, then it may be a longer-term impact. but nothing yet, matt, we haven't seen that come in as a topic of discussion yet.
matt pfau
got it. and last one for me. in the press release, you guys talked about sustainability initiatives that you have and ai and machine learning becoming more important to companies achieving those sustainability goals. maybe you could just expand on what you were referencing in the press release and what you're seeing in terms of sustainability initiatives driving demand for your software?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so forever, the supply chains have really been driven by economic delivery of goods, how to get the products to the right place at the lowest possible cost and make sure you get it there on time. that's been a long-term one. over the last five or six years it has been or maybe 10 years there has been a more focus on the environmental impact, which is one of the sustainability initiatives, what is the impact and as more and more visibility comes to that, it's been less economic driven and which is part of the environmental process, but more around just looking at the impact on the global environment.
so people are more adamant about that and then a more recent issue has really come up around the use of labor and proper labor standards around the world. so that's an important initiative. our traceability product that we announced and have deployed several times now. we announced it earlier in the year and has really been getting -- taking hold.
people are acting on it now. the regulations are coming into play. people get -- the customers are getting a handle on what they need to be able to do, and we're helping them overcome some of those challenges so that they can look back through the supply chain and make sure that their products are being sourced responsibly and with proper labor standards. so it's really come about.
it's driving some initiatives. there are a number of stand-alone opportunities that we're working on that are on this traceability component alone, and people are really trying to address those needs and be responsible providers of products to the marketplace.
matt pfau
great. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sir. appreciate it.
operator
and we'll take our next question from zach cummins. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yeah. hi, good afternoon. congrats on the strong results here in q3. allan, i just wanted to touch a little bit more on some of the challenges you're seeing with getting deals across the finish line and through these approval processes.
it sounds like some of the ones that were delayed in q2 have now moved into q3, and we're able to close some of those. but i was curious what you've really seen so far in q4 and what's really kind of given you the confidence that you can still execute in this environment and put up the strongest acv quarter here to end the year?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've got several contracts already under our belt. we've got them executed. so we're not quite all the way through the first month, but we're getting there.
and then just the magnitude of pipeline and the number of transactions in the phase we're in with those folks, zach, relative to getting contracts negotiated and the timing and the sequence of events to get projects kicked off, a lot of movement going on there. so unless we get into something really crazy, which maybe will -- that always could happen. but it's just the momentum play that's out there, the deals that are already done, the momentum play that we have around the ones that are very, very active right now and timing fairly short term to get contracts completed give us strong confidence that we'll be able to hit that level of performance.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and just considering some of the staffing shortages you're seeing at some of your end customers and the delay of some of the project timelines here. is this really causing any sort of differentiated approach in how you go about trying to close some of these deals? is that more of a focus on the existing base and trying to expand upon those relationships? i'm just curious how you guys are really trying to navigate through this challenging deal closing environment.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've done a couple of things. i wouldn't say we haven't changed our focus to internal more predominantly, but our existing customers more predominantly but we have some great projects underway with existing customers. they're dealing with one or the same issues that others -- traceability is a great example that most of that work is with existing customers where they're expanding their footprint, trying to make sure that they've got good labor practices in place.
but -- so a couple of things we've done relative to the staffing challenges they're facing, we're putting forward proposals that we're offering up the labor to help backfill and support steps in the project that may otherwise historically been done by the customer. we're putting forward a statement of work that is very prescriptive and trying to minimize the impact on their labor internally so that we can get those projects moving relative to the burden that's on the customers to get that done. we can't do it stand-alone. we still need time from the client in order to really effectively deploy a solution.
but we're trying to minimize the impact on their existing staff and minimizing the amount of work that they have to put in any given week. so we're taking a couple of those actions to make sure we get there. and then the other thing we've done, and we've talked about this a couple of times, is really just breaking up the project into smaller bite-sized chunks. the customers feel better about taking a smaller project, if they're looking at something that's going to be 18 months or 12 to 18 months to deploy, they're a little more hesitant and there are lot more scrutiny going into launching those projects.
so we've taken a path to say, let's break it up, what's the most important thing that we can do first that will give you the biggest return on their investment and minimize the impact and get a project going. so we're going to see that play out in a few less million-plus transactions. that was my comment earlier. we had several of those in the fourth quarter of last year.
there's a chance that we won't have any of those or maybe one of those this quarter. but we're going to have a higher flow of deals by getting them broken loose and getting the commitments. so hopefully, i covered that point for you, zach.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
absolutely. i appreciate all the additional color on that front, so thank you for that. and final question from me, allan, is really around the planned investments that you talked about during the script, whether that be more in-person events that you're hosting, more travel from your internal team and even just hiring additional people. i mean can you talk about, is there any particular area that you're looking to bolster your headcount and kind of what are some of the ways you're looking to attract talent in what's been a pretty tough hiring environment?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. a couple of things. there are going to be more in-person events it appears. so marketing and customer conference events, those kinds of things are coming back.
people have flipped them to be in-person. a few of our investor and analyst conferences we've gone in-person. so did get me back on the airplane as well, looking forward to it by the way. but -- so that's going to happen.
we're not going to get back and i don't anticipate through the first half of next year, we'll go back to the level that we were prior to the pandemic. but certainly, they were almost nonexistent in the last two years, a very minimal travel, mostly internal travel. but people are back on site. they're welcoming us back on site.
so we're getting more and more engagements going on there. but the bigger impact is really going to be our investment in the organization. we have -- in order to support our business plan, we need to expand in every area. as we bring more subscription business in, we need -- we're getting scale out of the cloud business, but we still need more head count in our cloud business to support them.
we've got some strong plans in r&d that we really want to expand our footprint. we think there are some elements to invest in that requires people to go develop our applications a little deeper in some of these areas. so we're going to be expanding our r&d investment as well. we're going to keep that in line with our revenue growth as a percent of investment back in r&d, but that means we got to bring more headcount in in order to do that.
we're expanding our sales team globally. we're expanding in every region. we're adding some staff here in north america. we're expanding into asia.
we're expanding into europe, continuing there. so we've got headcount addition, we want to pull into that area. in order to support that, we got marketing investment we needed to make. and our backlog of services business, even though we can rely on our sis, -- even when the sis are doing a predominance of the work, there's individuals we need from our team to support them in their implementation process.
so we're going to be staffing up in our services business. so there's not an area of our business that's untouched from that investment standpoint. the second half of your question was why are we successfully able to compete? well, first of all, i think people love this space. the fact that supply chain is a thriving, growing business they want to be part of that.
supply chains have an impact on the world. we feel good. the people -- our team members feel good about what we do through our customers to impact the world we live in. traceability, sustainability, environmental impact by improving the efficiency through our customers.
those are all exciting things to do. we've got a great culture here at the company. longevity is -- of our staff is evidence of a good working environment. so -- and then we're very competitive on our compensation structure.
so we're able to attract people. they're coming in. they want to be part of our team. and so far, we've been successful at filling the open roles we have.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst

allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
all right, zach. thank you very much for joining us this afternoon.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll move next to anja soderstrom. please go ahead.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations for a great quarter. firstly, i'm curious, you're talking about a lot of hiring and you're successful in attracting talent. but how do you see the wage inflation playing in and how are you going to be able to offset that or absorb that?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, the inflation certainly is in there and well deserved. the right talent deserves to have a requisite compensation, anja, so good question in that. we have no choice but to make sure that people are fairly compensated. so we're going to step up to the plate, make sure that happens.
that's going to have an impact. but the bottom line is that as we grow the business, we get scale through our efficiency. our services team, for instance, is working really hard at trying to improve the efficiency of the work we do with our customers. this prescriptive methodology helps.
so even though on a dollar-for-dollar basis, we have to make sure we've got fair compensation out there. we can get a lot more work done through those efficiency factors. in our cloud business, we're getting scale just through the natural deployment. it's not a one-for-one on expanding our customer base on a cost basis.
so even though we have higher cost from inflation, on where we do spend the money, we get scale through our efficiencies in the cloud business. so we think it's a balanced budget. we can't, as i mentioned in my commentary earlier, we don't anticipate that we can grow ebitda at the same pace that we did last year because of some of these investments we're making. but not all of that's inflation, some of that is just getting out over in advance of the business model to get -- we get salespeople on board this -- in the next couple of quarters.
they're going to have an impact in the longer term. it takes six to nine months for them to be fully productive. so we want to make the investment now. we'll put the money down and we'll get a return on that investment.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's a good color. and then also curious about the partnerships you mentioned in your press release.
can you just speak a little bit about what we can expect from those and give us more color on that?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good follow up question. the partners we have are really getting close with us and working hard to getting customers success, we're very much aligned with them on the objectives of the project. they are seeing the world the same way we are. that efficiency and effectiveness of getting projects up and running and getting systems deployed is important.
so we have very good alignment with their objectives, our objectives and the prospect objectives. we've done some pretty good investments in getting education and onboarding process going so that consultants are getting trained and certified ready to go. so that's been exciting. they are willing to put the investment in there to get them -- to get them educated so that they can be very effective when they are on the job.
so nice synergies, they are introducing us to new opportunities as well that we weren't otherwise aware of, so that's a nice spin-off of that. but the primary effect is that we're successfully getting customers up and running and live. and that bodes well for tackling phase 2, which is really the objective for breaking up these projects that we get phase 1 up and running and do that efficiently and effectively. then phase 2 comes along much quicker and that's an exciting part of our growth model.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you. that was all for me.

[operator instructions] please note, this call may be recorded and i will be standing by should you need any assistance.
and it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to vincent klinges, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
vincent klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, ashton, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's fourth quarter fiscal '22 earnings conference call. on the call with me is allan dow, president, and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks, and then i'll review the numbers. but first, our safe harbor statement.
this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth and contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements.
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated on statements made on this call. such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to allan for opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. i'm pleased to report that during the fourth quarter, we again achieved strong double-digit revenue growth in our supply chain management segment and for the company as a whole. this was a third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, which was driven by the double-digit revenue growth in our supply chain management segment in each quarter of fiscal 2022. our strong top-line performance was accompanied by a significant expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin as we gained efficiency from the cloud growth and achieved very high utilization rates across all of our services segments.
we had not anticipated the accelerated level of license revenue in the fourth quarter and normally in our recent history, but are pleased that our clients are continuing to invest in their supply chains by extending their partnership with us regardless of the licensing model that best suits their current needs and skills. we anticipate continued revenue growth in fiscal year '23 with the continued growth in our cloud business and a healthy backlog of project work. in spite of a very competitive labor market, especially in the supply chain and technical space, we are continuing to expand our team across all aspects of the business. we plan to repeat this pace of hiring to fulfill the needs of the expected growth in the years ahead.
between our growth investments and inflationary pressures from which none of us are immune, ebitda expansion will be tempered in the quarter and year ahead as we continue to invest for employee retention, expanding the team, and a return of in-person client meetings and marketing events, demanding a higher level of travel. the lingering impact of the pandemic, continuation of major world events, inflationary pressures, and chatter of a potential recession have extended the fragmented working environments, business uncertainty, and the frenzied activities of our clients as they address their short-term supply chain issues. staffing shortages in the supply chain and it organizations continue to impact the timing of contract approvals as clients grapple with how to implement a project while struggling with day-to-day operations. however, we continue to see a steady improvement in our pipeline conversion.
our strong close rate in the fourth quarter has pushed our project backlog to unprecedented levels and extended our rpo. in spite of some progress due to our prescriptive approach and staff augmentation efforts, we are mindful that new disruptions, labor challenges, and the potential recessionary pressures may cause some rockiness and project timing in the quarters ahead. overall, our pipeline continues to increase, driven by the need for our clients to holistically manage their supply chains in a sustainable and economically resilient way. the need for rapid decision-making has never been more in demand.
so we remain confident that between a larger opportunity set and improved execution, we are poised for a strong year ahead. our team is focused on serving existing clients, delivering on our implementation commitments, and bringing new companies into our client community more efficiently than ever before. the continued increase in our services backlog, we are relying more and more on si partners to assist in the delivery which puts a little downward pressure on the professional services revenue growth, but increases our reach and sphere of influence. the summer months are always a little choppier for billable hours, but in the longer view, we still anticipate continued high utilization rates across all services teams, which will deliver year-over-year growth and consistently strong margins in the supply chain consulting services business in the year ahead.
during the fourth quarter, we welcomed four new clients and completed subscription or license fee transactions in nine countries, reflecting our strong global presence. we also are pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which represented approximately 62% of total revenues in fiscal 2022. this was driven by the 26% increase in cloud services acv we saw in the fourth quarter when compared to last year's fourth quarter. with the increase in new subscription contracts and the continued stability of our cloud and on prem client community, we expect to see recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue continue to rise.
with the current level of recurring revenue, we feel the timing is right to provide guidance on our financial expectations in the year ahead. as we look forward, we anticipate total revenues of $132.5 million to $135 million, including total recurring revenues of $86.5 million to $89 million. with the aforementioned revenue and our investments in future growth, we anticipate adjusted ebitda to come in between $16 million and $18 million. moving forward, we plan to update our annual guidance each quarter to provide the investment community with a clear view into our progress against these goals.
as our recurring revenue guidance incorporates our assumptions for cloud service acv and is our primary focus for long-term growth perspective, we will no longer be reporting our cloud services acv metric, which tends to be lumpy on a quarterly basis, simply based on the variance of a few days or weeks timing of contract execution, which can skew the perception of how our business is performing. to be clear, our outlook for fiscal 2023 does assume that we will add more net new acv than we did in fiscal 2022. in summary, we're pleased with the fourth quarter and year-end results and expect to extend the performance improvements of our financial model in the fiscal year ahead. we remain intently focused on executing against our growing pipeline and look forward to reporting our progress next quarter.
our mission of making our clients more successful year after year is paying off in client retention and expansion as we introduce innovative capabilities for managing sustainable supply chains that attract new clients to our community of partners. at this time, i'll turn the call over to vince, who will provide the details on our financial results.
vincent klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, allan. so revenues for the fourth quarter came in at $34.6 million, an increase of 21% and from last year's quarter of 28.6%. that was driven a lot by subscription fees, which increased 37% year over year to $11.1 million, while software license revenue increased 153% to $3.1 million, compared to $1.2 million same period last year. included in the license revenues were several transactions with existing customers, including one seven-figure deal.
we continue to see a vast majority of our existing customers expand in the cloud, and we expect license revenue to revert back to a more typical quarterly cadence of approximately $0.5 million a quarter. our cloud services annual contract value, or acv, increased 26% to $48.2 million, and that's compared to $38.3 million in the same period last year. so we added $2.9 million in net new acv during the quarter and 26% of the net new acv was from new customers. so looking at our professional services and other revenue, that also increased 16% to $11.7 million from $10.1 million same period a year ago.
the year-over-year increase reflects a 24% increase in our it consulting business unit, the proven method, due to timing of project work and an 11% increase in our supply chain unit. our maintenance revenue declined 5% year over year to $8.8 million, reflecting a normal falloff rate for this quarter. total recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees representing 57% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 60% in the same period last year, and this decline is due to unusually high level of license fees in the current quarter. looking at gross margin, it increased to 62% and for the current quarter compared to 58% in the same period last year.
our subscription fee gross margin increased to 70% compared to 61% in the same period last year, and that's primarily due to increased subscription revenues and lower amortization of cap software expense. excluding the noncash amortization of cap software expense of $366,000 in the fourth quarter, our subscription gross margin would have been 73%, and that's versus 70% last year, with the amortization of cap software being $686,000 in the prior-year period. our license fee margin was 84% compared to 67% last year, and that's primarily due to higher license fee revenue. our services margin decreased to 33% compared to 36% last year, primarily due to lower utilization rates at our supply chain business unit, partially offset by higher rates at our it staffing business.
our maintenance margin was 83% for the fourth quarter compared to 79% in the same period last year. our gross r&d expenses were 12% of total revenues for the current period compared to 15% in the same period last year. our sales and marketing expenses were 16% of revenues for the current quarter compared to 18% in the prior-year period. and our g&a expenses were 18% of total revenues in the current quarter compared to 19% in the same period last year.
in addition to high -- in addition to net additional accruals of variable and stock option incentive compensation and higher incremental insurance recruiting and audit fees caused the g&a expenses to go up compared to last year. on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 186% to $5.5 million this quarter, compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. net income increased 17% to 3.6%, our earnings diluted share of $0.10, compared to net income of $0.31 or $0.09 per diluted share last year. on an adjusted basis, which excludes noncash amortization of intangible expense-related acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, adjusted operating income increased to 151% to $6.6 million, compared to $2.6 million in the same period last year.
adjusted ebitda increased to 101% to $7.5 million, compared to $3.7 million same period last year, and adjusted net income increased 22% to $4.4 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.13 in the fourth quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $3.6 million or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.11 in the same period last year. our international revenues this quarter were approximately 16% of total revenues for the current quarter compared to 50% in the same period last year. so looking at the full fiscal year '22, our total revenues increased 14% to $127.6 million, that's due to a 46% increase in subscription fees to $42.1 million and an 80% increase in license fees to $5.5 million, and a 10% increase in services, partially offset by an 8% decline in our maintenance revenues. adjusted operating income for fiscal '22 was $17.3 million, representing an operating margin of 14%, and that compares to $7.7 million or 7% operating margin last year.
adjusted ebitda increased 70% to $21.3 million, and that compares to $12.5 million a year ago, representing adjusted ebitda margin of 17%. adjusted net income totaled $16 million or $0.47 per diluted share, and that's up from $10.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share the same period last year. we exited the quarter with a remaining performance obligation, or rpo, which we refer to as backlog of $134 million, and this representing a year-over-year increase of 16%. strong growth in rpo reflects bookings over the past 12 months and the increased duration of our cloud arrangements from our customers continue to make longer-term commitments to our platform.
taking -- looking at the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with cash and investments of approximately $127.5 million at the end of the quarter, and this is an increase of $22.9 million compared to the same period last year. and during the quarter, we paid $3.7 million in dividends. our days sales outstanding as of april 30, '22 was 62 days for the current period, and that compares to 85 days in the same period last year. this decrease is primarily due to timing of billing and improved collections on delayed collections when compared to last year.
and as allan mentioned earlier, our mix of recurring revenue continues to rise, providing us with greater visibility in our financial model. so as a result, we believe the time is right to provide annual guidance, which we will update quarterly. so for fiscal '23, we anticipate revenue in the range of $132.5 million to $135 million. included in this is recurring revenue, which is $86.5 million to an $89 million range on our recurring revenue guidance, and this implies a 10% to 13% year-over-year growth in those -- in recurring revenues.
given the heightened macro uncertainty, our outlook takes into account the potential for elongated sales cycles, which could limit the amount of revenue we could recognize this fiscal year. that said, we saw gradual improvements in our close rates throughout fiscal '22, and we have not experienced a pullback in activity thus far. additionally, we continue to assume only modest levels of churn in our forecast, consistent with historical norms. for the adjusted ebitda, we are guiding to $16 million to $18 million range, which reflects planned headcount expansion across the company to support our growth aspirations, higher compensation to retain talent, and increased travel and marketing expenses as we return to more normal levels of in-person events.
ashton, at this time, we'd like to turn the call over to questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we will pause for a moment to let questions in queue. we will take our first question from matthew pfau with william blair. please go ahead.
matt pfau -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions, guys. wanted to just start on the macro a bit. so vince, you just commented that you've seen a gradual improvement close rates throughout fiscal '22, and it seems like that remained consistent in the fourth quarter. have conversations changed at all with your customers in terms of how they're thinking about purchasing as you enter fiscal '23?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
matt, allan here. thank you for the question. that's a good one. they have not really changed at this point.
we're seeing a continued eagerness to address some of the challenges that they've been facing over the last couple of years, and we continue to face in supply chains today. these disruptions keep coming, the interruptions, i think currently and historically, as i've been at this for the last 22 years. when we see the potential of a recession, people understand that to be just in one more of those disruptions or change in the profile, the way the demands are flowing and which products sell, which ones might not sell. so they're eager to keep going at this point.
but you probably picked up on some of the comments we made. we're just cognizant of the fact that that news is just starting to unfold and may impact the year ahead. we just started on the new year. and we just want to make sure we share our collective thinking with you guys as we anticipate the year in front of us.
matt pfau -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. i think some retailers have had challenges with having the sort of right product assortments in stock. has that driven any demand or additional interest in your products as i believe that's an area that you guys can help both retailers and cpg companies address?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, for sure. for sure, matt. that's very true. this -- the whole concept of forecasting is our primary area of expertise and where we stand out in the marketplace.
and you couldn't imagine a better opportunity for forecasting right now as we can all imagine, retail stores and retail channels, whether they're online delivery are really preparing right now for the christmas season. hard to imagine when the sun is coming out and is starting to get hot here in the northern hemisphere, but that's the reality. so it's a long-term view. it's a complicated view, and that's our area of expertise.
so that's one of the key areas that's driving it. they feel like they can do a better job with the forecast. they can do a better job of managing the supply chain and be more reactive to consumer demand. so you're spot on with where the level of urgency is playing out today.
matt pfau -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. and with the investments in fiscal '23, i appreciate there's some increased travel and as well as retention expenses in there. but what about from a growth or hiring investments? where are those directed toward?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, really all areas of the business, we want to continue to expand in our r&d organization, so the team is making moves there. we've actually been blessed with a bit of a shift in our strategy, moving to some lower-cost areas where we can get access to talent that's willing and interested in coming on board with us right now. so it's actually even though we're improving headcount, we're managing costs in a pretty effective way in that area. but we've got a lot of great ideas we want to execute on from product capability and organic growth there.
so we're going to continue to invest there. we still see the pipeline growing, and we have more opportunities coming. we see an increase in inquiries coming to us. so we need to be able to address that from a sales and marketing standpoint.
so we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing. and then, of course, even though we've built a great si channel, and we're offloading more and more work to our si partners, they can't fulfill all the demand as well. we don't anticipate they can in the year ahead. so we're continuing to invest in our services business to make sure we've got the right mix of talent that we need to augment what they can provide.
they can't provide all the services that we provide to our clients. so we're collaborating with them, what talent do they have, where can they expand. and we're going to make sure we continue to invest in bringing the talent in that will augment their abilities and capabilities and continue to be able to deliver on these project expectations from our clients. so i think the quick answer is, there is really an area of an organization that's not expanding, except for maybe vincent, who's sitting here in the room with me, hr and finance is not an area we have to invest deeply and we've got a great team in place today, and that's probably the one area we don't need any additional services in.
matt pfau -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. last one for me, just if i look at the guidance. so should we expect the maintenance component to decline in fiscal '23 at a somewhat similar rate that we've seen over the past two years? and then if so, i think that would imply that your subscription revenue growth would be over 20% in fiscal '23. is that the right way to think about it?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good way to look at it. we don't know exactly how that will play in. although we've made some substantial investments in client retention, and one of the areas we'll continue to see some maintenance decline, and i think a bit of an acceleration will be around the cloud conversions, where in the traditional line item that is maintenance, we'll see some of our clients more than we have in the past move to the cloud.
so there is a bit of a conversion factor in there. but right now, we're seeing our retention rate on maintenance back up with the lofty levels we had pre-pandemic. so we're comfortable with that level, but that's still existing churn in that number. so that the traditional historical levels is a good way to model that, matt.
matt pfau -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sir.
operator
we will now take our next question from matthew galinko from maxim group. please go ahead.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
hey, congrats on the strong quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. maybe firstly, now that the subscription business has scaled up quite a bit over the last couple of years, how are you thinking about subscription margins over the, i guess, intermediate term? where can you get them to? and i guess, what are you learning as you get to this point in terms of opportunities to continue driving that higher?
vincent klinges -- chief financial officer
yeah, matthew, this is vince. so yeah, we grew the margins nicely from -- compared to last year from 61% to 70%. we kind of -- the way we're thinking about it is we're trying to be a little bit conservative on the growth of that margin. but we do think by the back half of fiscal '23, we'll be on the higher side of the 70s, like 75%, 76%.
and eventually, possibly two years from now, be closer to approaching 80%.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
perfect. and then i think you just talked about conversions from maintenance to service. what kind of uplift are you anticipating on the revenue line as that cycle plays out? and i guess as a follow-up to that, i think you discussed significant investment in customer retention. so are those conversations feeding those conversion opportunities? or is that independent?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
they're very tightly like -- great question, matthew. this is allan, by the way. so on a like-for-like conversion, which is -- it happens but not the predominance of it, but like-for-like conversion, we typically see about a two and a half times revenue lift. and that, of course, comes with a lot of the incremental services that we're providing the client with some margin points on each one of those.
but we're better at it. we're more efficient at it. we're more quickly able to put up the releases and get the new features in front of them for the user community. we're better at security than they typically are.
so there's a lot of great aspects of it. and our clients are seeing time and time again that that's a good roi for them, along with a lot of incremental value. so two and a half times is probably a good model for that. more times than not, though, what's interesting is that that comes with an expansion of footprint from our clients.
so at that point, it's kind of all bets off depending on how much more they're adding as part of that project, but they could easily then see three, four, or five times revenue lift when you're doing a non-like-for-like more expanded scale. related to the pace of conversions and what drives the conversions, it's all over the map. i mean the like-for-likes when they occur in some of the things i pointed out a few minutes ago, they just want to get out of the it business is the simplest one. they're struggling with their resource pool, and they want to offload to us as a partner with them and their supply chain.
they see that they're lagging behind and they can't keep up and they know we're going to do better or they're concerned or struggling around any of the security issues related to it platforms today, and they know that the environment we have is safe and secure and well-administered day in and day out. so that can be a driver. but most oftentimes, it's driven by value opportunity, the desire to expand the footprint to pick up some new capabilities that they're struggling with to consolidate off some legacy tools and come to a single platform, supply chain planning, driving, and looking at the platform view for us. so those are all the things that are really driving the discussion around cloud conversions.
and all aspects of that are continuing to push more and more clients toward the conversion level. so i think in the year ahead, we'll probably double the number of conversions we've done in the past, which has been fairly modest. and then if you look out two or three years, that pace is only going to continue to increase. so we'll see -- we're really not -- in spite of what we saw in the fourth quarter, we didn't bring any new clients into a perpetual environment, the license transactions we did with all with the existing clients, but we see those numbers even declining and more and more cloud revenue coming forward.
so hopefully, matthew, i've picked up the answer to both of your questions in there. maybe add a little extra color to it.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
no. thank you. that was excellent color. so i'll pass it along.
thank you.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you so much.
operator
we will now take our next question from anja soderstrom with sidoti. please go ahead.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on the great quarter and year. so i'm just curious about the -- you sort of touched on it, but if you could give us some more color on the deal delays you've been talking about with the staffing shortages at your customers? how is that trending now? and how do you see that play out in this year?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
anja, could you repeat that question for me? it was a little bit muffled. i didn't completely catch the question.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. i'm sorry. just on -- you've been talking before about some deal delays due to staffing shortages at your customers. how do you see that developing now? is that picking up pace? or is that still an issue at your customers?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, great question. so thank you for that one as well. yeah, we're -- the more recent term we're seeing less delays than we did kind of mid-pandemic. at first, we saw just shock factor of the pandemic, the first year -- first six months of the pandemic was the shock wave of moving away.
then they got into staffing shortages that people struggle with having enough people. we've seen a little bit less of that as we came into this calendar year and the end of our fiscal year. but we still have a few projects that are lingering there. in fact, we had a couple of projects that just -- even though they contracted, they just didn't get going on the project itself and that they're picking up steam again now.
so less prevalent than it was, say, six months ago, but nonexistent yet. and we're seeing the ability to attract more talent. we're seeing more of our clients being able to attract the talent they need. and we've gotten much crisper at our ability to do staff augmentation and help them in ways to get projects going.
so we've been able to tamp that down a bit. but it's not gone yet, which is why we brought that topic still back up and it's the reality of what we're facing today.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then the acv added $2.9 million in the fourth quarter which is a little bit short of the target of $3.4 million, but you alluded to that being kind of lumpy and you won't report on that anymore to create a misperception. can you just elaborate on the lumpiness that's created in the acv?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we -- as noted in your comments, you picked up on it exactly. we had a higher level of license fee transactions in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated at the beginning as well as compared to historical trends. those -- again, those were all with existing clients.
there were nothing new from a license fee standpoint, a licensing model standpoint that came into the fourth quarter. but what we have seen in the past is that even existing clients move more to the cloud, the transactions we did in the fourth quarter were dominated more by clients who are doing a very good job of administering the applications in their environment. and as they continue to look for expansion, they felt comfortable continuing to do so. and we still are of a mind that extending the relationship with clients is the right move and that we don't want to put artificial barriers up to them and making decisions to move forward with us.
so once they declare their perspective that they wanted to continue their license transaction with us and manage it on-premise for themselves. we quickly agreed to that and wanted to really get down to how do we get them going on the next phase of their journey with us. so it was more about the next phase of the journey than trying to influence their direction in one place or the other. but we are quite insistent if we've got a client that's not doing a good job of administering their applications, we're very persistent in moving them to the cloud so that we can ensure that their success rate will stay high.
so i don't think we'll see that in the future. i think we'll go back to where we were maybe in the first, second, and third quarter, which is below $1 million in license fees. and i think that's what we've got in our thinking as we go forward.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok, thank you. and then one last one. is there anything to call out geographically?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. nothing extraordinary. but maybe an emerging trend that's worth noteworthy. if you look at the supply chain market outside of us, if you look at us and all of our peers, 55%, 60% of the supply chain expenditure and the planning arena, supply chain planning arena is in the north american marketplace, 25%, 30% of the spend is in western europe and then the rest is spread around the world, which doesn't leave a whole lot if you do that math.
that's pretty close to our revenue picture as well. if you look at our recurring -- our results on a quarter-to-quarter basis, long-term trend. but what is interesting is that the asia market is starting to pick up a bit. we're making some investments out there.
we're expanding our team. we brought on some new talent. we brought some new leadership into asia. we're expanding our channels to go into that market.
i think the reality is kicking in and even in asia is that -- which traditionally the reason it's been fairly light in expenditure is they tend to bias toward staff, labor, put some more bodies on the job and you can get the job done. the reality of today's marketplace is you can't -- staffing up, you hit the point of diminishing returns where the amount of staff doesn't make it better. and in fact, it's probably starting to decline their performance. if you put enough people in the room, you can't make a decision about where to go to lunch.
so managing your supply chain with a bigger staff is even more complicated. so -- they are starting to realize that and making investments in supply chain planning applications and thus our investments out there. so i think in the longer term, it will take a while to see that really bear out in the numbers. but in the longer term, we're going to see asia b -- asia pac b, in particular, to be a higher percentage of our revenue streams.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok, thank you. that was all for me.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
very good. thank you so much for joining us, and thanks for the questions.
operator
and we will take our next question from zach cummins with b. riley securities. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yup, thanks. allan, advanced congrats on a solid quarter, and then thanks for taking my questions. i know a lot of the key points i wanted to touch on have really already been asked. but allan, can you just go a little bit deeper into the mix of the pipeline right now? give us a little more color on the number of transformational deals that you're seeing in the pipeline and maybe even a little bit more about the inbound interest that you're getting from customers for your solutions?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say that the predominance of the pipeline right now is focused on transformational activity. it's coming a little bit of a flavor mix. people are -- they're serious about platform, they're serious about rapid decision-making.
they're very serious about automation. so the investments we've made in ai and self-learning systems, self-operating systems, prescriptive recommendations being driven out of the application so that they can act and move quickly on those are all critical flavors of what's going on in these transformational projects. with the pace of things changing with the lack of labor or turnover in labor people, the labor force in the supply chain space, the ability to have walking knowledge and be dependent on walking knowledge has become a critical factor for our clients. they just don't have that expertise sitting at the desk anymore.
so they're virtually all transformational. but in all cases, they're really -- almost all cases, they look at it and say, where is the critical factor. they want -- they want success quickly. they need value.
they need to address some of the challenges. so they're parsing out the projects and phases. we've got many of these transformational projects we're into phase 2, 3, and 4 right now with our clients. and many of the ones that we're starting on phase 1, have a phase 2, 3 and 4 that are completely lined out and ready to go, but they want to keep an acute focus on the most important thing that they need to address today.
and they want to return on investment within six months, which is an area of expertise for us. so it's continuing to attract the noise that we're putting out in the marketplace about the successes in clients and what's happening is continuing to spread organically around the world. just the number of inquiries, i think, in general, i think these people are addressing supply chain challenges. and then the investments we've made with our si community has continued to spread the word.
our name is becoming more prominent out there through their dialogue that they're having, and that's attracting people to us as well. so we continue to invest in our team to make sure we can capture on that opportunity and fold it from interest to pipeline into project and the multiple phases that are coming. zach, again, hopefully, hopefully, i hit the point to your question. if not, we'll go a little deeper.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
no, no. that was perfect, allan. and i know in the last couple of quarters, you've highlighted some improving execution from the sales team. i know a variety of factors, including some delays with deal closings and a litany of different macro factors present some challenges.
but can you talk about some of the successes that you've seen in driving the better execution and maybe some areas where you can drive even further improvement in the coming quarters?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think there's -- we've been investing in the team, and we've got some maturity on the team now that is very strong. and we've been talking about prescriptive models of how that works at great value for our clients. it takes a little while to get that messaging well articulated so that the clients can -- prospective clients can understand what we are talking about.
and as we continue to build the case studies with current clients actually executing in that model and seeing the true results of that happen come to bear the speed at which they're getting applications up and running and garnering value, and the value of the phased approach where they can get a quick return, on investments and move to phase 2 and move to phase 3, move to phase 4 successfully, that messaging is strong, and we got clients speaking on our behalf on why that's worked and where the value proposition is. so all those things help to build confidence. and in the area of making these strategic investments, particularly in transformational investments, our prospective clients are sitting there with -- they're really nervous. they're going to make a pretty strategic change in their way they operate their business.
they want to have confidence that that's all going to go well and that we're not going to disrupt their business. so our momentum, our success, our clients speaking on our behalf, all help to build that confidence level. and let's just go a little bit quicker at getting people to pull the trigger and get started on the project.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. and final question could be geared toward either you, alan, or maybe vince could chime in a little bit as well. but did you see the cash balance really building on the balance sheet, how are you thinking about potential m&a opportunities in a seemingly more favorable environment? and other aspects of capital allocation, potentially, i know the company already pays the dividend, but any sort of commentary on that would be great.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
well, zach, you hit on a really favorite topic of mine. so first of all, you're right, we do distribute through the dividend. we think that the current dividend level is fair and appropriate. we obviously are covering that dividend from operational cash flow, and we think that that's a good level there.
we'd love to make the acquisitions come true. and i guess, none of us wanted to see the stock market pullback except for -- from this aspect, the valuations of the potential companies that we could tuck in and our operations became much more realistic. so i can say we're in the market. we're working hard to find the right ones that are fit.
we've got a criteria that a couple of criteria that we look at for that one, is it a fair valuation. we can get a rapid return on investment on behalf of our investment community and our shareholders. so that's an important factor. but most important is there an opportunity to extend our footprint so we can take it back to our current clients, help them with current challenges, accelerate the revenue gains from an acquisition or reverse that the other way where we take our current applications and go back to the clients that are [inaudible] acquired company has and sell into them as well.
so we're there. we think that that's still the best use of our cash. and we're hard at work to see if we can pull off a couple of those in the years ahead here to add to it. we've done five of them during my tenure of 20 years.
they've all been very successful. we hope to find the right ones that will allow us to extend that success rate.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. well, thanks for taking my questions, and best of luck in the coming quarter.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter fiscal year '23 preliminary financial results. [operator instructions] please note, today's call may be recorded, and i will be standing by should you need any assistance. it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to vince klinges, cfo of american software.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, chloe, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to american software's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. on the call with me is allan dow, president and ceo of american software. allan will provide some opening remarks and then i'll review the numbers, but first our safe harbor statement. this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements regarding among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy.
any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. these forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call.
such factors include but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability in the market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. in light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to allan for opening remarks. 
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, vince. i'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were in line with expectations. as such, we're on track to meet the guidance we provided on the last call. we achieved 8% year-over-year revenue growth in our supply chain management segment during the quiet summer months where we traditionally see downward pressure on consulting services.
our subscription revenue growth remained solid at 23% and we are especially encouraged by the continued growth in our pipeline and the trust our clients place in us to help them stay on top of emerging technology trends. our strong top line performance was accompanied with a significant expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin, which increased to 14% from 13% in the prior year. we anticipate continued revenue growth in fiscal year '23 with the continued growth of the cloud business and a healthy backlog of project work. in spite of a very competitive labor market, especially in the supply chain and technical space, we're continuing to expand our team across all aspects of the business and are anticipating that we can stuff our expansion needs on a timely basis.
although the lingering impact of the pandemic, continuation of major world events, inflationary pressures and now the signs of recession continue to store some business uncertainty, we have not seen any slowdown in pipeline expansion. however, we're mindful of the potential for an extension and close rates. so we're working hard to keep projects on track and to get contract signed as soon as possible. staffing shortages in the supply chain and it organizations continue to be the primary impact on the timing of contract approvals as clients grapple with how to implement projects while struggling with day-to-day operations.
however, we've not seen any material change in this impact relative to the last few quarters. overall, our pipeline continues to increase driven by the needs for clients to holistically manage their supply chains in a sustainable and economically resilient way and the need for rapid and informed decision-making that has never been more in demand as our clients are facing another period of disruptions and uncertainty. we remain confident that between a larger opportunity set and improved execution, we're poised for a strong year ahead. overall, we're pleased to see the continued growth in our recurring revenue stream of cloud services and maintenance, which represents approximately 67% of total revenues in fiscal q1.
with the increase in new subscription contracts and the continued stability of our cloud and on-prem client community, we expect to see the recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue continue to rise over time. during the first quarter, we announced our most recent acquisition. so i want to offer a brief update on our progress there. the team that came over from starboard has been fantastic to work with.
the client community has embraced our strategy and we did not miss a beat on the opportunities that were in the pipeline we inherited. i would say that we're ahead of plan in the integration work and are accelerating the pipeline for network design optimization opportunities faster than we had anticipated. we closed one stand opportunity in july with an e-commerce logistics and fulfillment company to help optimize their logistics operations. we also successfully attached the network design optimization solution to one of the logility projects we closed prior to the end of the quarter.
this win was with a multi-billion dollar automotive services and parts company that is growing rapidly through acquisition. as soon as we presented our strategy for blending network design enables part of the planning suite, they were immediately on board. we will leverage the network design optimization solution to give them early insights on how best to integrate the acquired companies logistics operations, which in turn will provide insights on how to streamline the design of the planning solution. after go live, we'll have an integrated solution to manage an iterative design and planning process.
we're on track with building and executing on the pipeline for network design optimization and see this acquisition to be everything we expected, if not more in regards to a productive expansion of our footprint. the rapid success on this one clearly leaves us with the capacity to pursue other acquisitions with an objective to find at least one more with a strategic fit to our portfolio before the end of our fiscal year. as i mentioned in my opening comments, based on our q1 results, we're confident in our performance will be in line with the guidance we provided back in june, which is for total revenues to be between $132.5 million and $135 million and adjusted ebitda to come in between $16 million and $18 million. as the traditional, busy fall season comes into full effect and with our continued expansion of recurring revenue as we close in on the 70% milestone, we will be in a better position to provide any revisions to this guidance in our november report.
in summary, we're pleased with the first quarter results and expect to extend the performance improvements of our financial model during the remainder of this fiscal year. we remain intently focused on executing against our growing pipeline and look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. our mission of making our clients more successful year after year is paying off in client retention and expansion, while we -- in parallel we introduce innovative capabilities for managing sustainable supply chains that attract new clients to our community of partners. at this time, i'll turn the call over to vince, who will provide the details on our financial results.
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
thank you, allan. for the first quarter of fiscal '23, the revenues were $31.3 million, which -- that was a 7% increase from $29.3 million in the same period last year, both drive of that was our subscription fees which increased 23% year over year to $12.1 million. our software license fees were $0.3 million, compared to $0.5 million in the same period last year. our professional services and other revenues increased 5% to $10 million from $9.5 million a year ago period.
the year-over-year increase reflects an 8% increase in our supply chain unit and a 1% increase in our it staffing business, the proven method which was impacted by timing of project work. the maintenance revenues declined 6% year over year to $8.9 million, reflecting a normal fall-off rate. so the total recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 67% of total revenues for the first quarter and that compares to 66% in the same period last year. looking at gross margin, it increased to 60% for the current period and that compares to 58% in the same period last year.
our subscription fee margin increased to 70% compared to 67% in the same period last year and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense excluding the non-cash amortization of cap software expense of $508,000 for the first quarter and our subscription gross margin would have been 74% versus 75% last year. and the amortization of cap software last year was 819,000 in the prior year period. so our license fee margin was also up to 72% compared to 68% in the same period last year and our services margin increased to 27% from 26% last year. and that's due to higher billing rates at our supply chain unit and it was partially offset by lower utilization of our it staffing business.
our maintenance margin was 82% for the first quarter compared to 79% in the same period last year. gross r&d expenses were 14% of total revenues for the current period and that's compared to 15% in the same period last year and our sales and marketing expenses were 19% of revenues for the current quarter compared to the 21% in the same period last year. our g&a expenses were 18% of total revenues for the current quarter compared to 15% last year and this was higher due to variable and stock option and incentive compensation, insurance, computer software costs, recruiting and also legal fees related to our starboard acquisition. so on a gaap basis, our operating income increased 44%, $2.6 million for this quarter and that compares to $1.8 million same period last year.
net income decreased 28% to $2.1 million or earnings diluted share of $0.06, compared to net income of $3 million or $0.09 earnings per diluted share last year. on an adjusted basis, which excludes non-cash amortization of intangible expense related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted operating income increased 49% to $3.9 million, compared to $2.6 million last year. adjusted ebitda increased 26% to $4.6 million from $3.7 million last year. and our adjusted net income decreased 12% to $3.2 million on adjusted earnings per diluted share basis of $0.09 for the first quarter and that compares to adjusted net income of $3.6 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.11 in the same period last year.
international revenues this quarter were slightly up to 18% of total revenues compared to 17% in the same period last year. our remaining performance obligation this quarter or what we referred to as backlog, was $125 million. looking at the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with cash and investments at approximately $114.8 million at the end of the quarter. during the quarter, we purchased starboard, a network design optimization company for $6.5 million and also we paid $3.7 million in dividends.
our days sales outstanding, as of the end of the quarter was 68 days and that compares to 78 days from the same period last year. this decrease was primarily due to timing of billings and improvement in collections when compared to last year. and as allan mentioned, our guidance, we're reaffirming the fiscal '23 annual guidance that we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. so we anticipate revenues in the range of $132.5 million to $135 million.
this includes recurring revenue of $86.5 million to $89 million range. and then on an adjusted ebitda basis, we are guiding to $16 million to $18 million range and this reflects the planned headcount expansion across the company to support growth and also higher compensation to retain talent, as well as some other costs such as travel and marketing expenses. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over for any questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from matt pfau. please go ahead.
matt pfau -- william blair and company
great. thanks for taking my questions, guys. i wanted to ask, in terms of what you're seeing in the pipeline from a deal size perspective, is there any change there? and i guess what i'm wondering is, are some of the transformational deals getting perhaps broken into components given some of the macro concerns that are out there?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, matt, good question. we've seen basically the consistency with the last couple of quarters, but i think as we've -- it is smaller than we were three or four years ago, but that's consistent here, as we've exited the pandemic and moved into this new climate. so i'd say it's pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. we do have large transactions in the pipeline that are the transformational type projects, but we are seeing a number of folks who just want to take it a bite-sized chunk of the time and have a long-term plan, but short term chance to really focus in on getting some results.
matt pfau -- william blair and company
got it. and then the starboard acquisition, which certainly seems interesting, what is the go-to-market plan on that one? you signed an independent deal and then you also signed one that was in conjunction with logility. so maybe just help us understand how you're thinking about the go-to-market with that longer-term?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we certainly -- we'll continue to do stand-alone projects with clients much like we do with any of the other applications we have in the portfolio. there is nothing that really is -- has an inter-dependence that stops us from doing that anywhere in the suite. but as we see the real value is to add it to the planning suite and we're really crafting -- we're plowing new ground here with this strategy where we have a tightly coupled network design solution attached to a planning application and those two interoperate.
so the planning application is feeding the data necessary for network design on a real time basis back into the network design, so it's readily available for doing analysis if something comes up an opportunity or risk presents itself. and then likewise, you translate the other way, where once you make a decision in the design -- network design application to make a change to how the network is flowing how products are flowing through the network that will immediately provide the update into the planning application. so that's the automotive company i mentioned, completely saw that vision that we're excited about that opportunity as one of the things they struggled with for years and it's a very unique set of capabilities in the marketplace. nobody else is doing that today.
and we're on the forefront of that. so we think that's going to be the real driver behind -- and the accelerated growth model behind this acquisition. so we're very excited about that.
matt pfau -- william blair and company
gotcha. and then last one for me, just on the comment about wanting to find one more acquisition before the end of the year. so that would be, i mean it basically two within this fiscal year and it had been some time before you had -- since you had made your last one. so are you seeing just a change in terms of willingness to sell or quality of assets that are out there valuations, that's sort of driving you to become a bit more acquisitive when it's been on pause for a little while now?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think there is a good friend tell me this everything comes in three. so i'm probably going to give you four answers. but it's yes, yes and yes. so yes, we see a willingness to engage in the dialogue and ultimately to consummate a transaction for an acquisition for us.
we've seen a tremendous realignment of the valuation, which we've seen across the board. you all have seen that as well. but we think the valuations are very positive for us for making an acquisition. we think that there are more opportunities out there in the marketplace as well.
and then the fourth point is we're ready. we believe that there are some tuck-in acquisitions that extend our portfolio like the one we just talked about around starboard that will make a strategic difference for us as we go forward. and with our capital position continuing to grow cash and no debt. and we think it is the right move to actually deploy that -- the capital resources against the future growth model.
so probably those four things coming together really are driving our moves right now and we wouldn't limit ourselves to one more actually. if we found two, we would act on both.
matt pfau -- william blair and company
got it. thanks a lot, guys. appreciate taking my questions.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. thank you for joining us.
operator
and we'll take our next question from matthew galinko. please go ahead.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question, and congrats on getting the deal done. i'm curious how the cadence of hiring might look through the year. i know you provided some comments about your plans, but help us with the timing there and your confidence level on being able to hire against this labor market?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
we are very confident actually. matthew, thank you for the question. what we're seeing right now is actually, it's easier to hire today than it was a few months ago. i think there is a couple of factors, people have come back from vacations, they've got that behind them and they're ready to make some decisions and move, where worse we've got a very good pool of candidates were interviewing we got more people joining us in the month of august that we had in july or june or may for that matter and we're coming in, we're closing in very quickly on getting the resource loading we need for to carry us out through the rest of this calendar year.
so that feels really good. i think the labor market is shifting, people are looking for good-quality companies to join. i put us in the category of good quality companies. we're in an exciting space, supply chain space, we're a stable organization.
we're doing some exciting things that they're learning about as they read and learn about us. so we're very attractive and we're quite successful. first of all, pulling a diverse community of resources for us to consider and then our ability to actually get them to come join us is -- we're highly successful on once we find the right ones.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
thanks. and then i guess, i didn't hear anything in the prepared remarks but can you maybe talk about the pipeline of maintenance conversions at this point? and any cloud conversions to cloud in your existing customer base. and given the -- some of the macro environment factors that you highlighted, does that change the mix of how you see the pipeline converted to revenue over the next few quarters?
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
yeah, as far as what we call lift and shift moving for the on-prem clients that are out there today moving over, we did five of those transactions in the first quarter where -- if you went back to last fiscal year, we will probably do in three. so that's almost 50% improvement. those numbers are small. so i don't like to do that kind of math against that.
but yes, i believe that we will continue to see that trend, if anything, maybe accelerate more will move up to half a dozen seven, eight maybe a quarter or something like that. it's being driven by two things, one is our clients are under more pressure than i think we are relative to the ability to attract and retain folks. so their it organization is under a lot of pressure and they are less inclined to continue to operate applications, very strategic applications like ours, on-premise. so that trend is continuing to accelerate.
and as we add new capabilities, it is a perfect time to shift, they get a chance to upgrade to the latest release. we put new capabilities in play, add those at those components to the mix and they move to the cloud that way. so both of those drivers are pushing more and more clients to move over to cloud-based operations and putting the responsibility in our hands to deliver day to day. so i think the -- i think those two factors are going to continue to drive.
i don't think the -- i don't think we're seeing anything materially from the anxiety around the economic turmoil really has changed in the profile much, those other factors.
matthew galinko -- maxim group -- analyst
all right. thank you.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, matthew. appreciate your questions and thank you for joining us.
operator
and we'll move next to zach cummins. please go ahead.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yeah. hi. good afternoon, vince and allan. congrats on the solid quarter and thanks for taking my questions.
allan, just building off of some of your commentary in the script around overall customer sentiment. i mean can you just dive a little bit deeper into maybe the pace of deal closures that you're seeing across the entire customer base? and i know there is a variety of macro headwinds, but just trying to get a general sense of how customers are thinking about their investments in supply chain?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think the nice trend we have -- the retention that we've been working on for years now, and really high retention rates is really a positive for us. what that carries forward is one that recurring revenue sticks. but those clients are really expanding their footprint with us, they're adding new capabilities. we haven't gone back to the installed base yet with closing contracts for instance on the network design, we've gone to them with the presentation.
we've got a number of them that are now in the pipeline to add that as an extension to their footprint. so that's just one example of our ability to sell back into the installed base. we're still lot of pretty consistent run rate where a roughly 50% of our project business is coming from the installed base. so we've got a healthy balance, we're putting new logos into the mix, that represents about 50% of the new project work.
and we've got the other 50% half of it's coming from the installed base. so we believe that's a healthy ratio. you know, i've been at this long enough and been around here for 20 years in the supply chain space. here in past recessions, we've seen a trend toward the installed base, doing more and more of the work and less brand new projects from the ground up.
that is a, a bit of a normal trend in a down market or recessionary market that we've seen a couple of times in the past. we're not seeing that mix change yet, we still see new clients still investing and coming to us, adding to the pipeline and the close rate still look strong there. so we think at least this next quarter ahead of us, the one we're in the middle of now, that will retain that mix of the 50-50 as we go. so it's quite exciting.
like everyone we're anxious as you watch the news, it makes you pause for a moment, but then when i look at the pipeline and the activity and the close rate, we've got going on. i just don't see that impact in our activity right now. so we're excited to just keep it rolling.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. and just building off of some of the new customer commentary, have you seen any meaningful changes in the overall competitive landscape in the last couple of quarters, i know there has been some pretty notable transactions in the space with blue yonder being acquired. i'm just curious if the overall competitive set have seen much of a change.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think the most notable trend, the best of breed providers are still there, blue yonder, kinaxis, o9 and others, so i think that those markets are pretty consistent, those are play in the marketplace. and we all have our unique value proposition that differentiates us out there. we continue to see the erp providers being less and less entrenched so more opportunities that are popping up where they're either aren't getting considered or aren't winning and i believe that that is a clear recognition in the marketplace that they just don't have the depth of capability that's necessary to manage the complexity of today supply chains, the pace at which things change, the dynamics of it, just don't suit those capabilities very well and they are not keeping up with the best-of-breed providers. so that's probably the most dramatic thing.
we've seen that trend starting sometime back. we don't see it swinging back to the other way. so it looks like the trend is continuing.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. and final question for me, probably geared more toward vince, but is there anything meaningful assume for starboard and kind of the current guidance for the year on the revenue side?
vince klinges -- chief financial officer
zach, no, i think when we acquired starboard, we really didn't acquire for its current customer base at the time because it was fairly small. so if we're not putting a lot of meaningful revenue of the current customer base that we acquired, but we do have some anticipation that going forward from post-acquisition, it will start building into the revenue guidance, more and more. so we'll be watching that for about mid-year to see how that effects the guidance for the year.
zach cummins -- b. riley financial -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. well, thanks again for taking my questions and best of luck with the rest of the quarter.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, zach. thanks for joining and thanks for the questions.

[operator instructions] we'll move next to anja soderstrom. please go ahead.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a good performance. and so i'm just a little bit -- questions asked already. so i'm just to follow-up on the starboard acquisition.
how did that come about and had you been looking at and adding that specific capability for a while or how are your thoughts around the acquisition?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
anja, it's a great question. it is one that we can clearly say that was good planning and good luck coming together. we had -- i think we were talking about this maybe three quarters ago or so where we thought that the market landscape was going to be right for us to get back in the acquisition mode. we have put together a team identified four strategic areas that we thought were the most important, one of those in the top of the list actually did rise to the top of the list was this idea of network design and how it would fit in.
about that same time, we've got an outreach from one of the team members at starboard whose since joined our team and in helping us move forward on our strategic moves there. so we kind of -- that's where a good luck and good planning come together, we were ready. we had already started to investigate the marketplace, we had identified them but they beat us to the punch and reached out to us, around a potential partnership and the partnership evolved into an acquisition. and you can have a tighter partnership than what we got right now, it's just a fantastic team moving in and really accelerating the market for us.
so good luck and good fortune and good planning all coming together.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. sounds good. and congrats again on that. so do you anticipate to be able to excel this to all this time or what other times sort of alternative to this?
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
there is no one in our installed base that is not a candidate for this, everybody is. so number one, we are actively going back and presenting this to all of our clients. if they've got a stable supply chain where they don't change much around the flow of products, maybe there is less appetite for it, but that's almost nobody these days. if you had a very stable or single line of supply chain, our product sets could only come from one place and had very unique manufacturing requirements or something like that and network design is probably less prominent in that space, but even part of this is about the raw materials coming into the supply chain, so everyone has dynamics around that.
so there is a -- there is an ability to use that. probably the other gating factor is just their appetite to take on anything new right now that maybe the bigger challenge that we face. but will plant to seed today in hopes of getting their attention sometime soon in that -- in the portfolio. also takes us -- when we go the other way, they didn't, the starboard team didn't bring client base is big as ours over to the table.
so we didn't double, but there are a handful of clients over there that were already actively engaged on how to position the rest of our portfolio back into them and the other really exciting thing is they came with a partner network that is very active today and we've been able to shore up some of the partners, si partners and add a meaningful new component, as well as we've picked up a couple of new folks that are really excited about leveraging the rest of the portfolio we have and taking it back to their client base. so there is three or four synergies in there that i just outlined that are really, really powerful.
anja soderstrom -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. it sounds very exciting. thank you. that was all for me.
allan dow -- president and chief executive officer
