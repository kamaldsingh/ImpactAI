thank you. we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first questions come from the line of matt olney with stephens. please proceed with your questions.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, matt.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, matt.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to start with core loan growth, ex ppp and the warehouse, look pretty immaterial in the fourth quarter. would love to hear about the pushes and pulls on this in the fourth quarter with respect to paydowns, originations and then expectations for 2021.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
matt, we had a continuing large amount of headwind from paydowns in the fourth quarter. our loan -- at the end of the year, we went back and tracked. we booked approximately $3 billion of new funding's in 2020. we had about $3 billion of payoffs in 2020. and so we ended up being relatively flat or virtually flat for the year. and that compares to the year before where we actually had positive -- in 2019, positive loan growth. i believe our total funding's were around $3.2 billion. so the falloff in funding's was less than 10%, 2020 over 2019. but the payoffs accelerated and covered up the loan growth that we had. that said, we're seeing some positive early signs here early in the year, january, the payoffs seem to be trending down. we had positive loan growth, ex ppp and ex warehouse here early in the year. so, we're encouraged to us -- what we've indicated before, we did our planning around this year, which is a mid-single-digit loan growth, ex ppp, ex warehouse for 2021 and then accelerating to an upper-single-digit for 2022 and beyond. we really believe in a normalized environment, matt, that weakened in the markets we're in. and also, we've hired a head of middle market commercial for texas, very talented executive, who's been in this market for her entire career and somebody that we can really -- that we are going to build a significant team around here in 2021. so we think that a combination of the markets that we're in, matt, as well as this team, we're adding building in middle market commercial as well as the investment on the retail side and all that will yield us the ability long-term to continue to grow at rates that we were growing at prior to the pandemic, which is upper-single-digit.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. and then as a follow-up, i wanted to ask about the mortgage warehouse. i think you said average balances were around $1.2 billion, up again, just a strong year for the warehouse. would love to hear what the crystal ball says about the outlook here. i think we're all trying to figure out what -- where the volumes will settle out once we get beyond this current surge? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, as we're thinking about that, matt. the volumes were -- continued, as you said, to be really strong in the fourth quarter. we feel good about the quality of the mortgage companies we're doing business with, i feel like we've really been able to, by building the team that we've built, the leadership in that area, been able to build strong and important relationships with these companies. and in essence, matt, the goal with these quality relationships is to move up in the funding stack, if you will, so that as their volume tapers off, they take that away from other participants before they take it away from you. and so in that regard, we think we've made a lot of progress, and we're seeing it here early in the first quarter that our average outstanding's have not come down as much as we would have expected. that said our planning for this year is that, on average, about $1 billion, we think, is a good landing place as the market calms down for us. so, around $1 billion in average outstanding's quarter-by-quarter. right now, it looks like it'll be a little higher than that maybe in the first quarter, but for planning purposes; we're thinking $1 billion. michelle, is that fair?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think that's right.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
if i could sneak in one more with the warehouse, any color on pricing, whether it's settled down or if it's stabilized or improved at all over the last few months?
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
matt, this is dan. the pricing in mortgage warehouse is, i'd say, stable. there's always been pressure on it. and we expect, as we look at this year, that, that will continue to be there. but i think, as david said, the relationships we've built puts us in a good position, i think, to hold pretty well on the pricing for now.
matthew covington olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. great. thank you, guys.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
thanks, matt.

thank you. our next question has come from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
bradley jason milsaps -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
hey good morning, brad.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey brad.
bradley jason milsaps -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
maybe just wanted to start with asset quality. i think previously, you guys thought there'd be around an $80 million adjustment whenever you -- when you did adopt cecl. i guess, first, do you think that would be about the same? and kind of how does that impact your decisions around or how you're thinking about provisioning in 2021?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so -- yes, brad. so we are going to record our day one adjustment now as of 1/1/21, which is a different day one. so, we're in the process of finalizing that number, primarily because of pci loans. we're looking at the status of those and making sure that we're accounting for those correctly as of day one. but based on what we know today, i expect that last year, we disclosed, that would be about an $80 million adjustment. it shouldn't be much different than that. it could be a little less because we did have some larger pci loans that paid off during 2020 that we don't have in that number anymore. so, my best guess would be a $70 million to $80 million adjustment at this point on top of what we have in the reserve.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
for loan loss provision this year.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think -- i mean -- and i think dan would concur, i think we believe that we are fully reserved and wouldn't expect to have significant provisioning in 2021.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, i'd agree with that.
bradley jason milsaps -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then michelle, writing quickly and around kind of some of your expense commentary, it sounds like expenses might have been roughly flat, absent, maybe a few things that kind of went against you this quarter. first, i guess, is that kind of a fair assessment? and then secondly, kind of how would you feel about expense growth going into -- in this year?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think that's accurate, brad. if you look at our core schedule, we reported $74.8 million in non-interest expense for the quarter four, but that does still include that $1.3 million of the pto and the contract terminations that i mentioned earlier. and then if you go with my guidance that we figure we'll have 3% expense growth in '21, i think that puts us at about a $75 million run rate in non-interest expense going forward.
bradley jason milsaps -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then maybe just a final question for david. i noticed -- and you mentioned that you bought back a small amount of stock in the fourth quarter. just kind of curious, with the shares trading in the 60s, would you guys consider buying the stock back? or do you think saving capital here for potential m&a is maybe a better use? just kind of curious your thoughts around capital management.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks brad. our view is that with the volatility in the stock that our stock trading below two times tangible, knowing on the other side, you mentioned an alternative use is m&a, which we're very keen on and have been in our history as a public company, as you know, that said, price expectations from sellers -- from high-quality sellers in the best markets are still pretty robust. and so when we balance it up, it feels like our stock at below two times tangible, we should be more active -- north of two times tangible, we should be more active -- north of two times tangible than i think we begin to lean more toward hang on to it with an eye toward m&a and strategic m&a. so that's an outline. so yes, we will be active this year when our stock is trading below two times tangible. there's just a lot more clarity now about risk. the elections behind us, the pandemic, the vaccines are rolling out. so regardless of your view about specifically when we'll get to herd immunity and everything, i think we have a better handle on risk now than we had early in the fourth quarter as an example, when our stock was trading in the 50s, and we were a little more hesitant to be super aggressive there, pending what was going to happen in the election and all that. so hopefully, that gives you a little clarity.
bradley jason milsaps -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
no, thanks. i appreciate all the color. i'll hop back in queue. thank you.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question has come from the line of brady gailey with kbw. please proceed with your question.
brady matthew gailey -- keefe, bruyette, and woods, inc. -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, brady.
brady matthew gailey -- keefe, bruyette, and woods, inc. -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the other side of mortgage, not the mortgage warehouse, but your traditional gain on sale mortgage fees down in fee income. and if you back out the hedging adjustments, and it looks like the last couple of quarters that's been running a little on top of $13 million a quarter. so a very nice level. i know it's tough to forecast that into 2021, but how much the downside do you think we could see in mortgage fees just as that market calms down a little bit in 2021 versus 2020?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. as you said, brady, that mortgage volume is really hard to predict, because it's so based on rates really. i mean, i can tell you, through january, their volumes were still really good, maybe get down a bit from where they were in december, which is sort of seasonally unusual, right? usually, it takes a bit for them to get going again. i think is what we've guided to before is that we thought they wouldn't go back to where they had been previously because we've really built out that team and that group and added lenders. so we're thinking though, they could go back down to 25% less volumes, but that's not really what we're calling for this year. i expect that they will continue to have good volume for the first half of the year anyway.
brady matthew gailey -- keefe, bruyette, and woods, inc. -- analyst
all right. that's fair. and then, michelle, on the topic of the margin, i know you've been talking about the margin compressing down modestly, which is what has happened. yes, i mean, off the 344 base this quarter, how should we think about the margin, excluding any sort of noise from ppp forgiveness, kind of that core margin, is compression still the right way to think about it into 2021?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it is. it is, and when i -- when we talk about core margin, i am excluding all of purchase accounting accretion, which we'll continue to have in ppp fees, which we anticipate we'll get most of our ppp income on the first round in this probably first and second quarter. based on our modeling and our outlook for this year, we think our margin is probably going to compress a couple of basis points a quarter, so could compress eight basis points over the year. that's my early outlook anyway. just given our loan yields currently are coming on 10 to 12 basis points lower than our overall average yield. we are trying to invest some of our excess liquidity in our securities book, but those yields currently are about 1.35. so while that's not great, it is better than what we're earning at fid, so just trying to boost our net interest income a bit there.
brady matthew gailey -- keefe, bruyette, and woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. all right. and then finally for me, i just wanted to ask about bank m&a. it seems like everybody is expecting 2021 to be a fairly robust year for bank m&a, especially in texas. i mean, david, i just heard your comments about sellers' expectations are still pretty robust. and with your stock under two times, then maybe you just look to continue to buy it back. but i think the market may be anticipating you guys kind of reengaging in your traditional bank m&a game. so maybe just a little bit of color on how you think bank m&a will unfold in texas? and do you think ibtx will be active?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. our desire is to be active, brady, as we have been in the past. there are a lot of discussions going on across the market and i'm encouraged by that. on the other hand, our list of targets are -- call it, $2 billion to $10 billion in asset, high-quality companies in the major markets in texas and denver. that's not a really long list. it's probably eight or 10 companies. and given that we are involved, i'm encouraged. i do think there's going to be m&a in texas here in the first quarter, second quarter and through the year. i think it's just early to tell so much of it, as you alluded to brady, depends on how the market is trading generally and how stock prices are doing and how sellers -- what seller's expectations are. but we're looking for a high-quality company that wants to be a part of what we're doing, and we want to do a smart deal with the right company. i am optimistic that that's going to happen for us this year. but that said, we're not -- kind of the joke around here is, we don't need the practice. so we're going to do a smart deal with the right company. we don't need to do a deal just to say, oh, geez, we can still do m&a. we're going to grow our company.
we're continuing to build out our infrastructure and building our platform to be a $25 billion, $30 billion company, which is still where we believe we'll be in three, four years and, kind of, really focus as well on building out that middle market, executing on our retail strategy and getting back to a more robust organic growth rate as the core of our company, that's always been the core of independent different than some acquirers. we're an organic growth company first, and then we layer in really high-quality material m&a on top of that, when we get the opportunity. so i'm optimistic about it, but also realistic that there aren't just three or four great companies out there going, oh, we're ready, we're ready. it just takes work and continuing to build relationships and then the timing has to be right. so...
brady matthew gailey -- keefe, bruyette, and woods, inc. -- analyst
all right. that makes sense. thanks, david.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, brady.

thank you. our next questions come from the line of brett rabatin of the hovde group. please proceed with your questions.
brett d. rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
hey. good morning, david, michelle.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, brett.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, brett.
brett d. rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
most of my questions have been asked, but wanted to circle back around on loan growth and the organic growth story. can you talk about maybe hires -- maybe late in the year and then what the prospects you think might be for 2021? and i'm thinking about that core mid-single-digit loan growth for 2021, is that going to be more in specialty lines of business? or maybe give us some color, if you could, just on how you think the organic growth or what buckets ends up coming from?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. happy to give more color on that, brett. we did continue to build-out, and we're a little further along in building out the retail team so we've hired a leader there, kenyon warren and then a strong team of leaders with kenyon. we had a strong presence already in colorado on the retail side. so that's going very well. the biggest hire we made recently was the addition of as i mentioned earlier, tiffany cason, who is a long time, texas executive and middle market commercial lending, and she joined us, i believe, beginning of the year and is steady building out her team now. we're talking with lenders across texas, particularly in houston, as an example, where we expect to be active there building out the team as well. and so it's the early days, but i expect by the second half of this year when we kind of look out brett, by the second half of this year, we should have some tailwind particularly in the middle market side on the loan growth, organic loan growth. so we think our loan growth, we expect here in the second half of 2021 and into 2022, it's going to be more balanced than it historically has, although we're still seeing a lot of great real estate opportunities and transactions. but we expect and are seeing a little more floating rate flavor to what we're adding. as michelle said, we're adding a little below what -- adding loans a little below what our current portfolio rate is eight, 10 basis points or so. so it's not a year ago or, i guess, early in the pandemic. with the competition last summer, we were adding loans at 25 and 30 basis points below our portfolio rate that's narrowed now at eight or 10 basis points. so i think that's a contributing factor to what michelle said about the nim. but when we have an $11.5 billion book, and we're adding $50 million or $100 million a month to that, then it takes a while for -- at eight or 10 basis points, the math doesn't jerk your loan yields overall down quickly as long as you can add loans in and around five, 10 basis points below the total portfolio yield.
brett d. rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just back on the margin. maybe i appreciate the color on the core margin commentary, michelle. any -- i know it's difficult to predict to some degree, but any color around the stated margin in the first half of the year, how you expect that maybe the ppp forgiveness to play out in the first half of the year? and then any thoughts around the, say, discount accretion, at least for the early quarters?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that ppp number, brett, right now, we think that most of it's going to come this quarter. we have had a good amount of payoffs that have came in, in january, and i think that will continue through the second quarter. i really can't predict the impact. it will be a few basis points increase on our margin. it will be a bit lumpy. purchase accounting accretion should just continue at a similar rate. it will just continue to go down. i think it was a little less than $7 million in the fourth quarter. that's going to continue to trail, just look at it as going down a couple of hundred thousand dollars a quarter is what i would expect at this point, that number has become pretty stable.
brett d. rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. great. appreciate the color.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, thanks, brett.

[operator instructions] our next questions come from the line of michael rose with raymond james. please proceed with your questions.
michael edward rose -- raymond james and associates, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, michael.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, michael.
michael edward rose -- raymond james and associates, inc. -- analyst
just had a question on the increase in classified balances this quarter. they're still really low as a percentage of loans, but just wanted to see what drove that increase? was it some of the kind of covid impacted sectors just classifying them?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, michael, this is dan. yes, as you noted, it was only up slightly really from the third quarter, a little bit of c&i in there, some hotel, as you might expect, would be part of that. but those would be the two primary categories.
michael edward rose -- raymond james and associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then maybe just one last one for me. so the -- just back to the mortgage warehouse. so it's grown essentially every quarter since you guys kind of got in the business a couple of years ago. if we're assuming growth is going to be on the health for investment side, kind of lower than it has been historically, at least during this period. is there any reason that you might want to get a little bit more aggressive in the warehouse? and maybe can you just give us an update on number of customers, et cetera? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't know the number of customers right off hand, mike, we can get that to you -- paul can get that to you later today for sure. our core belief is that mortgage warehouse is a terrific business when it's in the right proportion to your balance sheet and to your income and because of the volatility, it's still a business we're cautious around. we like it a lot. we have great customers in it, but we don't want it to be $2 billion or $3 billion. so our core view is average outstanding's around $1 billion, give or take, is a good place to where we want to be. and look, i do think there's an opportunity to be aggressive in that business right now, if i wanted to be, we just are choosing not to be.
michael edward rose -- raymond james and associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's all i have. thanks everyone.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the independent bank group fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce paul langdale, senior vice president and director of corporate development. thank you. you may begin.
paul langdale -- senior vice president, head of investor relations and director of corporate development
good morning, everyone. i am paul langdale, senior vice president and director of corporate development for independent bank group, and i would like to welcome you to the independent bank group fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. we appreciate you joining us. the related earnings press release and the slide presentation can be accessed on our website at ibtx.com. i would like to remind you that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual and expected results to differ. we intend such statements to be covered by safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements. please see page six of the text in the release or page two of the slide presentation for our safe harbor statement. all comments made during today's call are subject to that statement. please note that if we give guidance about future results, that guidance is a statement of management's beliefs at the time statement made, and we assume no obligation to publicly update guidance. in this call, we will discuss a number of financial measures considered to be non-gaap under the sec's rules. reconciliations of these financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included in our release. i'm joined this morning by david brooks, our chairman, ceo and president; dan brooks, our vice chairman and chief risk officer; and michelle hickox, executive vice president and cfo. at the end of their remarks, david will open the call to questions. with that, i will turn it over to david.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. our company's fourth quarter results represent a strong finish to a difficult year with healthy fourth quarter adjusted net income of $1.34 per share and adjusted return on tangible equity of 16.33%. full year 2020 net income of $201.2 million reflects the value of our granular community banking model and our ability to adapt to a changing economic environment. reflecting on the past year, i'm especially proud of how our employees across texas and colorado rose to the occasion during 2020 to serve our customers and communities under trying circumstances. as dan will discuss further, our credit quality metrics remain strong and reflect our conservative credit culture and disciplined underwriting standards. we continue to be encouraged by how well our portfolio is holding up though as always, we are vigilantly monitoring for any emerging risks as general and macroeconomic uncertainty persists. our capital ratios are at historically strong levels with a total capital ratio of 13.32%. and our robust liquidity position continues to be augmented by organic deposit growth of 21.54% annualized in the fourth quarter. during the quarter, we also took advantage of our recently reauthorized share repurchase program and repurchased 109,548 shares of our stock for an aggregate cost of $5.7 million. with that overview, i'll turn the call to michelle for more detail on the operating results for the quarter.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david. good morning, everyone. selected financial data for the quarter is on slide six. fourth quarter adjusted net income was $58 million or $1.34 per diluted share compared with $56.8 million or $1.32 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year, and $59.6 million or $1.38 per diluted share for the linked quarter. net interest income was $132.8 million in the fourth quarter, up from $128.1 million in the fourth quarter last year, and up from $132 million in the linked quarter. while net interest income was negatively impacted by year-over-year reduction of $4 million in purchase accounting accretion, this was more than offset by a continued reduction in funding costs during the quarter and earning asset growth that was primarily driven by increased mortgage warehouse loans as well as cash held at other banks due to continued deposit growth. the adjusted nim, excluding all loan accretion, was 3.24% for the fourth quarter compared with 3.49% from the fourth quarter last year and 3.32% in the linked quarter. the core margin decreased by eight basis points from the linked quarter due primarily to lower asset yields as well as increased balance sheet liquidity. total noninterest income was $19.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $25.2 million in the linked quarter. while mortgage production remains strong and gain on sale margins compressed only slightly mortgage banking revenue was impacted by fair value adjustments on loans and derivative hedging instruments of $4.3 million due to treasury rate increases during the fourth quarter. noninterest expense totaled $75.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase from $73.4 million in the linked quarter.
professional fees increased $493,000 and charitable contributions were up $300,000 from the linked quarter. fourth quarter noninterest expense also includes $1.3 million of unusual items due to pto paid out because of the pandemic and two accrued contract terminations. slide 22 shows our deposit mix and cost. total deposits were $14.4 billion as of quarter end, an increase driven by organic deposit growth of $747 million, or 21.54% annualized for the quarter. we estimate approximately $395 million of deposits related to ppp borrowers remains on the balance sheet as of december 31. capital ratios are presented on slide 24. in the fourth quarter, the company's consolidated capital ratios continue to grow, with the common equity tier one ratio increasing by nine basis points to 10.33% and the total capital ratio increasing by three basis points to 13.32% for the quarter. as david mentioned, we did utilize our stock repurchase plan during the fourth quarter, acquiring $5.7 million in shares. that concludes my comments. i will turn it over to dan to discuss the loan portfolio.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
thanks, michelle. overall, loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans, were $11.6 billion at quarter end, down slightly from the linked quarter. excluding ppp loans of $804.4 million, loans held for investment decreased year-over-year by $87.2 million, primarily as a result of the economic dislocation caused by the pandemic. while new loan originations continued to show recovery from earlier in the year, commercial real estate loan payoffs remained elevated in the fourth quarter. mortgage warehouse purchase loans averaged $1.2 billion for the quarter, up from $894.9 million from the linked quarter. our mortgage warehouse continues to see robust demand due to the low interest rate environment. slide 17 provides additional detail on our pandemic loan modifications. of the $2.6 billion of loan balances that received temporary payment relief during the pandemic, only $205.7 million remain an active deferral as of january 15, 2021. loans with active payment deferrals represent just 1.7% of overall loans held for investment. this number includes loans that have been restructured with payment deferral mechanisms under section 4013 of the cares act. the largest group of loans remaining on deferral are hotel credits, and we remain confident in the strength of this conservatively underwritten book. our credit quality metrics continue to reflect the overall strength of the portfolio with total nonperforming assets of $52 million or 0.29% of total assets at december 31, 2020. nonperforming assets increased over the linked quarter due to the addition of a $12.6 million energy loan that has been discussed in prior quarters as well as two commercial real estate loans totaling $15.9 million.
these additions were offset by a $3.5 million energy charge-off and the renewal of the $15.7 million commercial real estate loan that was discussed last quarter. net charge-offs remained low at 11 basis points annualized for the fourth quarter and were primarily driven by the previously mentioned energy charge-off that had been fully reserved against in prior quarters. as you know, we elected to defer the adoption of cecl last march with the expectation of adopting it as of 12/31/2020. on december 27, 2020, new legislation extended the adoption date to january 1, 2022. the sec has indicated they will not object to an early adoption date of january 1, 2021. and therefore, we have elected to adopt cecl and record our day one returned earnings adjustment as of that date. our 2020 provision was calculated using the incurred loss model, and we will use the cecl model going forward for 2021 provisions. these are all the comments i have related to the loan portfolio this morning. so with that, i'll turn it back over to david.

thanks, dan. looking back at 2020. our community banking model enabled us to effectively manage risk and deliver another year of consistent financial performance, despite an unprecedented operating environment. most importantly, this allowed us to support our customers and serve our communities when they need us most. we are also proud to have continued to enhance shareholder value by growing tangible book value per share, increasing our dividend and reauthorizing our share repurchase program. looking ahead, our company is well positioned to win new business and participate in the economic recovery across our footprint. though uncertainty remains, we are encouraged by what we're seeing on the ground in texas and colorado and we look forward to seizing opportunities for continued growth and shareholder value creation as the new year unfolds. thanks again for taking time to join in the call today. we'll now open the line to questions. operator?

thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from michael young from truist securities. please go ahead.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
hey, good morning, michael.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. wanted to just start on the loan growth outlook, you've been pretty optimistic, i think, about the second half of the year and you know, kind of a rebound in loan growth there. are you still seeing kind of those trends, whether it be customer communications or loan pipeline building that, that keep that confidence in place?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes, michael, we are confident in the loan growth forecast that we've been talking about. previously we were off a little in the first quarter, now we weren't surprised about that, but the pipeline picked up, the fundings were accelerating toward the end of the quarter and that's resulted in, already in april we're positive for the year. so our net fundings in april have been very strong so far, and the pipeline is as good as it's been since before the pandemic. so we have reason to believe that, we'll have positive growth here in the second quarter, and then evolving back in the second half of the year to a more normal range of 6% to 8% for us on a go-forward basis. so we're feeling better about that now as it's playing out on the ground.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and i guess my follow-up would just be, your comments on the inorganic side, you mentioned there at the end, you know, i think, the market has been hot and cold and hot and cold, so it sounds like maybe a little more optimism, a little more conversation is being had now, and i would just be curious for updated thoughts there, especially related to maybe size as we've seen a few more moes kind of get announced recently.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
sure. i think the activity, the questions, or the conversations rather certainly are picking up, in texas as well we have seen a lot of activity. nationally, more on bigger deals, as you allude to there, michael. i still think our sweet spot is going to be downstream high quality acquisitions of companies here in texas in the major markets. and you some good, very good positive conversations there and some very good companies and, and i think as people, part of what's going on, i think, michael, is, that is people get more confidence in where this economy is landing here post-pandemic and what their opportunities are, and then i think some of the public companies are getting to get a, beginning to get a better feel for what their opportunity to do downstream acquisition is, and that's affecting how they're thinking been about, a merger partner for themselves. and so i'm more encouraged than i was in the first quarter. we'll see, obviously, we haven't seen much activity in texas. so we'll see how that comes about. my understanding is, there's a lot of activity in the pipeline across the country and i'll be surprised if they can get to texas sooner than later.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer

the next question is from brad milsaps from piper sandler. please go ahead.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
hey, good morning, brad.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
michelle, maybe i wanted to start with expenses, pretty flat linked quarter and i think in line with your guidance, but there was sound like, there were a number of pluses and kind of minuses within the quarter. just kind of curious how you're thinking about sort of expense run rate as we move through the year kind of taking into account all those items that you discussed?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sorry, you're exactly right, brad, there was a lot of noise, specifically in the salaries and benefits line that i referred to in my comments earlier. i think when i look at it, we probably had around $2 million of expense that i would sort of called non-recurring after first quarter, but then that was offset by the deferred costs that we had related to ppp. so if you pull out all of that, noninterest expense probably would have been around a $1 million higher than what we reported. one of the things we have is about a $650,000 expense related to the ppp portal that we recorded that will continue, probably through q3, as we get those loans paid off. so that's made the run rate a little bit higher than what i expected. so i think if you sort of add all that up, that the run rate will be between $75 million and $76 million is what i would expect the rest of the year.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then as my follow-up question, i was curious, the impact of ppp fees in the quarter. i apologize if i missed that. and then what are the amount of fees that you have remaining to recognize for the remainder of the year?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
we're in the program.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so, we recognized about $4.8 million of ppp fees in the first quarter and that compares to $4.2 million in q4, but there was about, i think a $1.5 million [phonetic] of that was related to loans that were paid off. and we have about $14 million remaining from the first round and then now the second round to recognize. we expect that, right now, we expect we'll recognize about 70% of those this year, and then there will be some that will probably carry over into 2022.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thank you guys. i'll hop back in queue.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer

the next question is from matt olney from stephens. please go ahead.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
hey, good morning, matt.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
saw some really nice deposit growth this quarter and it looks like you were deployed some of the liquidity into the investment securities portfolio. saw the duration did extend that a little bit. would love to hear more about the strategy around liquidity, deposit growth and then what you bought in the first quarter and could we see additional growth in that securities portfolio from here? thanks.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, liquidity has been at least my biggest challenge this year, matt. and i think we guided that we were going to start putting some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio, which we have been doing. we haven't really changed our strategy there though, that portfolio is very low risk, we tend to keep it pretty short. our -- what we're investing at has probably been about 150 [phonetic]. so you've seen the overall yield of that portfolio has come down even though as we're putting more in there. right now, our expectation is we'll grow it to about $1.5 billion by the middle of the year. now as liquidity keeps coming, and as we have the ppp payoff, our liquidity has continued to increase, so we might decide to increase that a bit more, if the loan growth we are seeing does not continue. so we'll manage that as we see opportunities on our balance sheets. we've been investing in primarily agencies and mortgage-backs, again, all very high quality, low risk portfolios.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay, thanks for that, michelle. and then on the mortgage warehouse, would love to hear more about the customers in your portfolio and it seems like the market's shifting from a refi to purchase market. do you have what that split is for your portfolio as far as the mix, and i guess secondly as industry volumes are expected to slow, in the back half year, it seems like we could see pricing come in incrementally, i think you guys have been focused more on smaller customers. so would love to hear your views on volumes and also yields for the balance of the year? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes, so i don't, i don't know in the warehouse, if we have an exact split, as you said, we're certainly seeing the same trend, matt, of the refi shifting to purchase. one of the challenges in texas is, there just an under-supply, if you will, of homes for sale, the builders are building as fast as they can and selling every house they build, and homes going on the market and lasting 24 hours. and so that's, in talking with our mortgage folks, both the retail mortgage and the mortgage warehouse, that's, the concern is, as the shift continues from refi to purchase, will there be enough supply on the purchase side. that said, of course, supply and demand, could affect pricing. we saw a little bit of a decline in the first quarter in our gain on sale on -- in our retail portfolio. the mortgage warehouse for the first quarter was actually average balance is a little higher than we'd expected holding pretty flat with fourth quarter at around $1.2 billion.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
$1.2 billion.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
$1.2 billion. i think we're expecting that to come down to something in the $900 million, maybe average for the second quarter, it could be a little lower, a little better than that, but if we were picking a number right now, we'd say, average mortgage warehouse down from $1.2 billion to $900 million would be, i think a good guess, a good safe estimate. and then the retail mortgage side, their volumes have been very good so far in april, and their pipeline looks good, so i think on the retail mortgage side, brad, probably flat for this quarter for q2 from what we saw in q1 would be a safe thought on that. and our mortgage warehouse has actually moved more upscale over time to more, i'd call it mid-tier and a little bit larger-tier clients. so we'll take the same headwind there that some other banks are facing, but probably on average, we still do have some smaller customers, probably more so than some of our peers.
matt olney -- stephens -- analyst
okay, thanks for the commentary.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, matt.
operator
the next question is from brett rabatin of hovde group. please go ahead.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
hey, good morning, dave and michelle.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
good morning, brett.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
i wanted just to talk about loan yields and just about the margin a little bit, the average rate in the first quarter for 42 [phonetic]. i'm just curious where you're originating new production relative to the existing yield? and then michelle, i was just hoping for any commentary, i know it's tough with liquidity and ppe, but would you assume the margin, given that funding costs are probably getting closer to the bottom, it's tougher to keep the margin where it is or do you feel like you can improve it? any commentary on the margin would be helpful.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
let me talk first brett about the loan yields we're seeing a pretty even split, kind of, 50-50 on our growth right now between c&i and our cre portfolio. the yields on the cre portfolio are a little better than the commercial c&i yields on average. and, but i think we're now, seeing average yields come in the upper-3s, 390 [phonetic] maybe, michelle sound about right for what we booked in late in the first quarter, so we're seeing yields of the oncoming around 390 [phonetic] and we would expect that to be pretty steady here as we go forward and then i'll let michelle talk about the nim, but if we continue to try to find homes for that liquidity other than 10 basis points at the fed, we've begun to increase that mortgage book. as i mentioned, we've had very positive loan growth so far in the second quarter, it's early, but we're back to net positive for the year and expect that to continue to accelerate during the course of the year. so hopefully that will be a home for some liquidity as well. but michelle on the nim.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, i think what david said is accurate. we're really focused on trying to grow net interest income at this point, and not so much focused on margin, just because of the amount of liquidity we've had and how it's impacted the margin. but my outlook is, if you look at core margin ex accretion, it's -- at this point it looks like it could compress 6 basis points to 8 basis points just because we are trying to be opportunistic at putting assets on our books, as david mentioned that would replace funds that we're holding at 8 basis points at the fed. so really just looking to be able to grow net interest income versus so much focus on margin.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then i guess the other thing i was curious about was just, you're a cecl bank now, and it kind of looks to me like you're provisioning needs will be pretty light just given your strong asset quality trends. can you give any outlook on provisioning from here? obviously, the negative adjustment in the first quarter, around cecl, but it just seems like you're provisioning needs will be pretty light going forward.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
hey, brett. this is dan. i'll take that one. while the moody's forecast data that is used by our bank, and most of the banks certainly continues to point to improvements in economic conditions, i think it's going to take a few quarters still for us to ultimately see what the impact will be for all of the different asset classes that we and the other banks loan into. as an overall comment, we feel very good about our portfolio and we believe the credits that are deserving of reserves are already listed on the watchlist and have some reserves against them and depending primarily on loan growth and any additional reserves needed on specific loans, if needed, i think you could see some additional reserve releases could occur in the future quarters.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
thank you.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
we certainly don't expect at this point, brett, to take any additional loan loss for the foreseeable quarters ahead. and is this a question of whether between the moody's and our loan growth, and any additional provisions for any credits we're working on would drive us to how much of a negative provision or flat or whatever, but i don't think, michelle, unless you've seen anything differently than we see, we see the likelihood of taking any additional provision.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. based on what we know about our portfolio right now, i would not expect it.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay, that's great color. thank you so much.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, brett.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

the next question is from brady gailey from kbw. please go ahead.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
hey, brady. good morning.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
so i think i heard dan mentioned something about, as it relates to the mortgage warehouse keeping that at an appropriate size. i'm not as concerned about next quarter this year, but as you look longer-term, i think it's about 9% of average loans now. but what would you think is an appropriate size, like do you guys have -- once it hits 10% of loans, that's kind of where you slow down or how big could you allow the warehouse to get over time?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
i think we are flexible brady and how we think about it in terms of, you know, at any given point in time. but our general thought is that 8% to 10% of the loan portfolio is a good range for us to be in. certainly, if there is a bulge in the market and we went to 11% or 12% for a quarter, we wouldn't panic about that, but just we try to continue to guide that our core belief is the mortgage warehouse is a great business as long as it's in the right proportion to your balance sheet and earning assets and your capital, and we think somewhere in that range. so we set out at a -- at $11.5 billion, $12 billion of loans held for investment, somewhere around $1 billion is a good place to be. it could be, as i said earlier, it could be $800 million or $900 million in any given quarter, it could be a $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion in any given quarter, but somewhere around there. and then your question, maybe, brady, as we continue to grow the bank or if we were to make an acquisition, and we have a $25 billion balance sheet with $17 billion in loans, would we think differently? of course, again 8% to 10% of that might lead us to the target of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. so we, it is a business we expect to grow as we continue to grow our balance sheet, both organically and with strategic m&a. and if you say, hey, in two or three years out, we're a $30 billion company, and we have a $1.5 billion to $2 billion mortgage warehouse, we'd be fine with that.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yeah, all right. it was great to see the dividend increase this quarter. and it appears you did not do any share repurchases. maybe just an update on, i know your stock's now north of 2 times, but any update on how you're thinking about the share buyback from here?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yeah, we still continue to believe that our stock trading north, well north of 2 times book is, we're better off to look for strategic acquisitions for that capital and that's our primary target. in the meantime, as you mentioned, our board increased the dividend. i expect that we'll continue to look at increasing the dividend in the quarters ahead, assuming everything that we know today about continuing strong profitability trends and strong capital improvement trends, and then ultimately that we would deploy that excess capital in a strategic opportunity.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
yeah, and i actually wanted to follow-up on the m&a too, i'm surprised we haven't seen more activity in texas, and we saw bancorpsouth cadence, which was a big deal, but outside of that, it's been pretty quiet despite seeing your m&a pickups in other areas of the country. i just wanted to, is it a seller expectation issue or do you think this is just a way that's building and we're about to see a lot more activity coming out of texas?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
i just don't think there is a sense of urgency maybe, brady, that a lot of people expected coming out of the pandemic that everybody would be looking around and trying to get something done and announced quickly up. i think there is a sense that, hey, we're heading into a strong economy here, a strong recovery over the next 18 months, 24 months, the concerns are you may be a raising -- rising rate environment in the future if, with the amount of stimulus and infrastructure spending and things that, it appears we're going to be doing that, that could drive rates higher, people are thinking about that i think and how it affects them. some banks believe that would be -- for some banks that would be a really positive event. and so there may be some thought of, gosh, if rates are going to go up in a year or two, maybe i wait until i get my nim and my earnings up, and i'll get a better price for my shareholders. and as we've talked about before. brady, some of the other smaller public companies here in texas, i believe are really looking around to see if they can find, one of the things that drives that, actually if they can find strategic options to purchase downstream banks, and one of the things that drives that is the same thing we're facing which is increasing capital, and some of the, i think smaller public companies are sitting on very nice capital ratios and feel like, if they could deploy that capital into a smaller acquisition themselves with their balance sheet and their earnings up, then they can command a better price for their shareholders, and that i think theoretically, that's absolutely correct. i think practically it's just difficult to find a good partner, to execute well, and then, and then to see all of those increased earnings in this window that we're going to have right, where i think it's going to be a good opportunity, the next 12 months to 18 months for the strategic merger activity. so i think it's a lot of those factors going on, brady. but i still think that you will see some of it come together here in the next two to three quarters, and there'll be some activity in texas, but i am more encouraged as i said than i was in january, but not, still not -- i still don't think there's a floodgate about to open, i'll say that.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then finally from me, i just wanted to ask about kind of the local five there in texas. we've heard from a lot of the other texas banks that have reported, that have been pretty upbeat on the local economies, and texas is clearly back to business and is really doing well. is that the vibe that you guys are seeing in your markets as well?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
absolutely. i think the economic numbers here in texas, in particular, are very strong. there is continued job growth. people are generally getting back to business. there is still some, a little bit of hesitation may be on the restaurant, hospitality side, that is a little slower to get going here, but they'll be rolling we think here in the next few months, and so, no, very positive. our customers' attitude seems to be good. and that's, as i mentioned earlier, playing out in very strong funding so far in the second quarter with a big pipeline increasing our new teams in c&i and retail are beginning to get some tailwind on their production as well. so yeah, we feel good about the loan growth, feel good about the economy, which undergoes that loan growth, and continuing to see job relocation announcements all across our footprint, and so we feel good. in denver, the same thing. denver has maybe been a little slower to get back to the level of activity that we've seen in texas, but they're doing extremely well and we expect that to be back in full stride as well by summer.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
great, thanks for the color, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, brady. [operator instructions] the next question is from michael rose from raymond james. please go ahead.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. most of my questions have been asked and answered, but i wanted to go back to kind of the loan growth outlook. i think you previously, david, talked about kind of mid-single digits ex warehouse, ex ppp, loan balances were down a little bit again this quarter, clearly, there's going to be some headwinds in some of the covid impacted portfolios in the energy book as we move forward. can you just talk about some of the hiring efforts that you made? i know that drove an increase in expenses this quarter and maybe what gives you confidence that you can get to that, that range by year-end? obviously the backdrop is certainly improving, it looks like, denver will come back on later this year. just can you give us some color as to where you would expect the growth and maybe what the contribution from some of the newer hires might be as we move forward? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
no, good question. good morning, michael. good question. and we are continuing to see opportunities to hire really talented relationship officers, particularly in the middle-market team that we've been continuing to build out. we also added strategically on, other -- in other areas of the bank including real estate, where we see an opportunity in a market where, and we've seen a little bit of turnover as well, just i think normal people looking at other opportunities and in us getting a chance to replace as well. so continuing, -- the new expenses were related more to, i'd say the middle market and the retail hires in the retail team and they're getting, as i mentioned earlier, some good traction as well. the growth is really coming in all of the major texas markets, we're in dallas-fort worth, austin and houston. and then denver, as i mentioned as well, is a little slower to get going, but expecting that to be in full bloom here shortly. the contribution from these new teams is going to be significant and is picking up now, we think by the second half of the year. a combination of the improving economy, improving borrowers' expectations for their own businesses and then our new teams and the new relationships that we're cultivating as a result of that, all that adds together to a normal run rate we think, michael, of upper single digits 7%, 8% kind of growth long term. we think we'll get back there in the second half of the year, maybe toward the end of the year, we expect to be significantly positive here in the second quarter, which then with the slight decline we had in the first quarter means, i think we're about -- it's playing out about how we thought with the kind of a low-single digit growth for the first half of the year and then a mid-upper single-digit growth in the second half of the year, resulting in a total for the year of 4%, 5% maybe. if you look at december 31 of last year to december 31st of this coming year, that our loans held for investment should go up we think 4% to 5%, overall, again low single in the first half, upper single in the second half due to that 4%, 5%, and that's, we're very confident in that growth.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
great, that's great color, david. i appreciate it. maybe just one for dan, you noted in the slide deck that, on the hotel book you might need some additional time for those borrowers to recover, but i guess what we're hearing kind of across the southeast and in texas for that matter is that occupancy rates are surging and there is, last week, in [indecipherable], large hotel chain basically saying there was more product needed at this point. can you define more time, because it seems like the hotel bookings are coming on very strong as people are getting back out there again. thanks.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
you bet. good morning, michael. my take on it is, we are certainly seeing improvement and occupancy and i would say all of the hotel owners have said it's about time that we see that. and i suppose in some areas, in particular, it has been surprising how quickly it bounced back, and it wasn't that temporary, what was the cause of it, i don't think we really know yet, but certainly the outlook is better. what we have heard from our customers, what we continue to believe is that, you would in fact see it recover, but the question is how long. and i would say, it depends on where those properties are located. as we've talked about before, if you have a hotel property that's right next to an airport, where they have struggle to get occupancies, in particular, those those hotels have been impacted. they've seen a nice bounce back here and that should be sustainable. so i think in 2021, in large part, many of them will recover to places where they're comfortably covering their debt service and making some return. there'll be others that still probably languish a little bit longer, so probably not a whole lot of new guidance to you in that other than, yeah, we're all glad to see the improvement that we've had so far.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
great. i appreciate all the color. thanks for taking my questions.

david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, paul. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. we are pleased to report a solid start to the year, that reflects the continued hard work of our team members across texas and colorado.
for the first quarter, our company reported adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, recorded double-digit organic deposit growth and posted additional increases to our already strong capital ratios. furthermore, credit quality metrics remained strong with just 1 basis point of annualized net charge-offs for the quarter. given the continued strength of our earnings and balance sheet, our board of directors has authorized an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share.
year-to-date, we have originated an additional $273 million in ppp loans to help our customers through the final stretches of the pandemic. as we anticipated, loan growth continued to be impacted by the pandemic related pay-offs during the first quarter. however, we are beginning to see encouraging signs of accelerating loan growth and loan demand. as the pace of the economic recovery quickens, we anticipate net positive loan growth in the second quarter with a more normalized loan growth returning in the back half of the year.
with that overview, i'll turn the call over to michelle for more detail on the operating results for the quarter.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david. good morning, everyone. please note that slide 6 of the presentation includes selected financial data for the quarter.
our first quarter adjusted net income was $60.1 million or $1.39 per diluted share compared with $43.4 million or $1 per diluted share for the first quarter last year and $58 million or $1.34 per diluted share for the linked quarter. net interest income was $129.7 million in the first quarter, up from $123.2 million in the first quarter last year, and down slightly from $132.8 million in the linked quarter.
year-over-year net interest income growth was driven by a reduction in funding costs as well as higher earning asset balances due to mortgage warehouse growth, which offset a reduction in purchase accounting accretion. the slight reduction from the linked-quarter was due primarily to day count. the adjusted nim, excluding all loan accretion was 3.13% for the first quarter compared with 3.48% for the first quarter last year and 3.24% in the linked quarter. the margin decreased by 11 basis points from the linked quarter with increased liquidity impacting it by 8 basis points and the remainder due to lower asset yields. core loan yields were down 5 basis points and investment yields were down 26 basis points from the linked quarter.
total non-interest income was $18.6 million for the quarter compared to $19.9 million in the linked quarter. overall, mortgage production volumes remained strong in q1, despite the rising rate environment and were down only about 15% compared to q4. compression and gain on sale margins impacted mortgage income relative to the linked quarter.
non-interest expense totaled $75.1 million for the first quarter, a slight decrease from $75.2 million from the linked quarter. q1 non-interest expense is always impacted by increased payroll taxes and other compensation items for bonuses and raises relative to the linked quarter. payroll taxes were up $1.3 million from q4 2020. recruiter and signing bonuses were about $800,000 related to new production team investments and we had $650,000 of unusual rsa amortization for performance grants and accelerated vesting. salaries and benefits were positively impacted by $3.3 million of deferred loan costs related to the origination of ppp loans.
slide 20 shows our deposit mix and cost. total deposits were $14.8 billion as of quarter end, an increase driven by organic deposit growth of $405 million or 11.4% annualized for the quarter. we also had about $350 million in reciprocal deposits we moved off balance sheet to reduce expenses that are not included in these numbers.
capital ratios are presented on slide 22. in the first quarter, the company's consolidated capital ratios continued to grow with the common equity tier 1 capital ratio increasing by 61 basis points to 10.94% and the total capital ratio increasing by 81 basis points to 14.13% for the quarter.
on january 1, 2021, the company adopted cecl which resulted in a day one adjustment of $82 million to the allowance for credit losses for both loans and unfunded commitments. this includes $13 million related to previously acquired loans that had been recorded at a discount. the adjustment to retained earnings was about $54 million after tax.
that concludes my comments today, so i will turn it over to dan to discuss the loan portfolio.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman and chief risk officer
thanks, michelle. overall loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans were $11.7 billion at quarter end compared to $11.6 billion at december 31, 2020. excluding ppp loans of $912.2 million, loans held for investment decreased year-over-year by $241 million, primarily as a result of the economic dislocation caused by the pandemic.
average mortgage warehouse purchase loans remained flat at $1.2 billion for the quarter, reflecting our strategy to maintain average warehouse balances in an appropriate proportion to our overall balance sheet.
overall, our credit quality metrics continue to remain strong with total nonperforming assets of $61 million or 0.34% of total assets at march 31, 2021. the increase in nonperforming assets versus the linked quarter was primarily due to the adoption of cecl during the quarter, which resulted in the addition of $10 million in purchase credit deteriorated loans that were excluded prior to cecl adoption.
classified loans totaled $253 million at march 31, 2021, up slightly from $239.6 million in the linked quarter. net charge-offs remain low, at just a single basis point annualized for the first quarter. at march 31, 2021, the cecl allowance for credit losses is $165.8 million or 1.54% of loans held for investment, excluding ppp and mortgage warehouse loans.
these are all the comments i have related to the loan portfolio this morning, so with that, i'll turn it back over to david.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, dan. for the past year, we have focused on being there for our customers and communities, while strengthening our infrastructure and ensuring a scalable platform that meets evolving customer expectations. we continue to see the results of these investments in terms of both internal operational efficiencies and in new digital offerings, like our online account opening platform, which launched earlier this month. we also continue to attract new talent to the organization, including a new chief digital officer who joined us earlier this month.
looking ahead, our company operates in four of the strongest growth markets in the country and we are well positioned to capitalize on significant growth opportunities as the economic recovery accelerates across this footprint. as always, we remain committed to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. to that end, 2021 appears to be shaping up to be an active year for bank m&a, and i expect our company to pursue strategic, financially attractive and well structured deals as opportunities present themselves.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler. you may proceed with your question.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
michelle, maybe i wanted to start on the expense side of the equation. i was writing quickly there. but it sounds like you expect the -- some of the increased occupancy expenses to come to pullback, while some of those ppp consulting fees will remain at least through the end of the year. would you expect expenses to kind of fall back into that sort of $76 million, $77 million range or any warehouse space there?
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think that's fair, brad, yeah. in occupancy, i think there is a little over $1 million of cost that we recognized in q2 that shouldn't repeat at that level. the run rate is a bit higher than what i guided to last quarter, because our expenses related to the ppp repayments for people that were paying on contract labor to help with that as well as some of the software solutions that we're using are more than we expected to be for a longer period of time. and so, i think that's probably good. it's probably $76.5 million to $77 million in expense run rate for now.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then, maybe just moving to the balance sheet. david, obviously some really good loan growth in the quarter. you guys are still sitting on a lot of cash. just michelle, just kind of curious what is your plan there to sort of kind of wait for the loan growth to continue to accelerate and redeploy there or might you grow the bond portfolio additionally with some of that excess cash and liquidity you have?
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. given that the minimal amount of return we get with many sitting in the -- at the fed even with rates on securities coming back a bit this past month, we're continuing to deploy our excess cash into the securities portfolio. right now, our plan is it would be close to $2 billion by the end of the year, but obviously we monitor that and that will depend on loan growth as well.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you, guys. i'll hop back in queue.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, thanks, brad.

our next question comes from the line of michael young with truist security. you may proceed with your question.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you for taking the question. wanted to maybe just start on the loan growth front, obviously very good net production this quarter, but curious about kind of just outlook in terms of payoffs and pay downs. we've seen a lot of pressure from other banks in that area. are you guys seeing any of that? and is that kind of the -- maybe the reason for the high single-digit growth versus if that's lower could it be -- could it actually be stronger growth in that on a core basis?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, michael. we feel really good about the loan growth for the quarter. we think the high upper single-digit estimate for the second half of the year accounts for the summer time and the normal low and closings in the summer, so you could see a little bit of a pullback here in the third quarter and then probably accelerate again in the fourth quarter that's how we would see it in the pipeline right now. but the loan growth, the net loan growth we had for the quarter was really a function of increased production more than a reduction in pay-offs or pay downs, while they normalized a little bit, we're not down materially from what they were in the first quarter where we saw was over $800 million of net production for the quarter, which was couple hundred million more than we've been seeing, we've been running kind of in that $600 million or $650 million a quarter and having similar size pay downs.
this quarter, second quarter, the pay-offs and pay downs were a little under $600 million and our net production was well over $800 million. so, we got -- that is how we ended up with the net 12.5%. it also was very well spread. our 45% of the new production was in our core cre, just our customers in our markets spread across all the different product buckets. and then about 20% of it was in construction lending, as you know, the single-family market in texas and colorado was just at historic high levels. so we're seeing a lot of a single-family construction. we're also seeing multifamily construction, some neighborhood retail construction just all the markets at and product types that we've always done well in. then over 20% of the new production was our new c&i funded debt and we had a lot more commitments than that, but that's the funded portion.
and then the rest of it would have just been -- we've got a portfolio of product for jumbo single family, some retail, we're seeing some pickup in retail consumer demand as well. so, really a very strong base. and then in terms of -- geographically it was about two-thirds texas, one-third colorado, which is right in line with our balance sheet. so, evenly spread in texas across our three major markets and so our team did a really good job. they have been hostile and everybody has been working hard for 18 months and it's been frustrating that we haven't had been able to show the net loan growth.
but i think this quarter is a reminder michael that what we've been saying for eight years as a public company that, we're both an organic growth company and a strong acquirer when the right opportunities come around. so we are not in a situation where we feel that we have to go do m&a to keep the accretion train moving or whatever. we can grow organically. we are going to grow organically. i think we've been consistent in saying that this quarter was, i think, a welcome reminder that we can still grow our company organically. we're in the best markets in the country.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, david, for all that color. really appreciate it. i guess my second question was maybe just on loan pricing and how that kind of compares to the back book or how -- what kind of pressure, i guess, maybe do we expect over the back half of this year? and then when will we kind of see stability in those loan yields?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we are encouraged by that as well, michael, that i believe although michelle gave the exact number, but i believe our -- the net loan production for the quarter came on at a -- with 2 to 3 bps higher than...
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
well, average loan yields this quarter were up 3 basis points over our previous quarter as we've got ppp loans paid off and our product -- our new production and our loans held for investment, obviously, those rates are a lot higher than 1%.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
right.
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think our -- the last time i looked, michael, the loan yields were coming in maybe still 10 to 15 basis points lower than what our overall average yields are ex-fees right now. so, i thought that was good to see the increase in the average yield this quarter. if we can maintain that stability, i think that's good outlook for our nim.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw. you may proceed with your question.
brady gailey -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
yeah. it's brady gailey. good morning, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, brady.
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
so i wanted to start with the dividend. it's great to see another increase seems like you'll been increasing it a lot recently, but the payout ratio is still pretty modest, it's only about 25% to 30%. how do you think about kind of continued dividend increases from here? and is there a landing zone you want to be at as far as the dividend payout ratio?
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman & chief risk officer
our current philosophy brady has been to pay out about 25% of our trailing earnings. to your point though, our board is really having a lot of discussion around is 25% the right number given that we're generating capital. even with our growth rate, we're still generating capital more quickly than we can deploy it. so we've been watching and expecting that there would be some strategic opportunities on the m&a front. so we haven't been in a huge hurry to be buying back our stock that we've talked about at the prices it was trading at.
and so yes dividend is one way we can continue to trend toward paying back more. i think our board is looking at that payout ratio now whether 25% is the right number. given the m&a, given the possibility of stock buybacks we've been comfortable with the 25% level, but we also have an eye toward continuing to increase the dividend as time goes by. so i think that's our bias, if you will. our lean is toward continuing to increase the dividend and then with the volatility we've seen in bank stock prices pulling back here there may be opportunities for us to be opportunistic on the stock buyback as well.
we certainly would have been in the market last week with the volatility we saw had we not been blacked out for the earnings. so we're going to continue to look to be opportunistic there and our m&a discussions continue to be positive. i'm surprised, i think is anyone is that we haven't seen more announcements here and by late july we're well into the third quarter now and i think there's a lot of discussion, lot of dialog going, but every board is taking a look at their situation and trying to ascertain what the best pathway for it is and i think you'll see opportunities and activity here in the second half of the year, but we're in the second half of the year now so we'll see.
brady gailey -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
yeah. and david, on the m&a topic, i mean just from talking to other banks it seems like it could be an issue with seller's expectations just being pretty elevated. i mean, do you think that's one of the biggest reasons why we haven't seen more m&a in texas?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i do think that brady i think pricing -- i think the volatility of the stock prices has been a little bit of a damper on activity as well. the private companies are going, gosh. what if we announced a deal at a certain price and then the market trades. all bank stocks down 10% the next week. and then also i didn't get a premium for my company and so there's those kinds of discussions going on. and i think people are -- i am encouraged that people are being thoughtful around finding a partner that makes sense for you and negotiating a deal that's a win-win. and so those are the discussions we're in. and as i mentioned a moment ago, we're going to be patient. we've been disciplined in our m&a approach for 25, 30 years now and i don't think now is the time to jump out and lead the league and hitting.
brady gailey -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
and then last question from me david. it was interesting to see the press release you will put out, i think last week or maybe the week before about hiring john turpen from -- i know he was recently at tcbi, but maybe just a comment on that hiring kind of what he brings to ibtx.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, we aspire i think you have to set the brady first that we aspire to continue to grow. we're a growth company. we're continuing to look not only at our organic growth, but strategic opportunities. so i've said that we can easily be a $30 billion company by the end of next year and then growing from there. so, as we aspire to continue to grow, we felt like we need to continue to add and expand our team, our leadership team. we got to know john during the texas capital merger discussions last year. really thought highly of him. he is a seasoned executive with a terrific background in u.s. bank and other large companies. and the truth of matter is we're a big community bank and we've grown up from a small community bank into a bigger community bank.
and as we become a regional bank, brady, i think it's important that we continue to add and expand our leadership. we've got new leadership in areas like human resources and marketing, and opportunity to pick up a seasoned risks guy who can come in and help us build a deeper and better infrastructure around compliance and enterprise risk management and all those things and with a view toward how it's done in u.s. bank and other bigger companies. i think was an important hire for us. and i think you'll continue to see us add to our team, expand our team as time goes forward as we build out leadership for the future.
brady gailey -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for the color, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, brady.

our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens. you may proceed with your question.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i was going to ask about the mortgage warehouse been pretty volatile so far. the first half of the year, would have love to hear about the -- your thoughts on balances for the back half of the year.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, matt. we were hopeful that we could landed in that $900 million to a $1 billion range. the markets pulled back a little faster than we expected three to four months ago. and so it looks like we're going to settle in here in $800 million-ish range. that's where we've been trending here the last couple of months. and talking with jim white who runs that business for us, that's roughly where we think we'll be now for the balance of the year. it's been very competitive in that space as you know as the business has come back a lot of banks have been aggressive in trying to hold on the market share and that's led to a little more competition on the pricing side. and so our guys are doing a great job of working with our customers. we have -- we use the opportunity of that expanded world of mortgage world of that was going on in the last year to upscale some relationships and get into some stronger credits and then we were in there slugging it out for fundings with everyone else. and so it looks like we're land around $800 million.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, david. and then, michelle, you had mentioned already that the securities balances could potentially get up to $2 billion at the end of the year as you deploy some of the liquidity. i'm curious about that liquidity. is there a level you're trying to get this down to? i think the earn out levels are around $2.5 billion at june 30 or 16% of average earning assets. what are you targeting within the earn out levels?
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. that's a lot higher than we would like for it to be matt. and i think pre-pandemic, we were closer to $700 million. and really what we'd like to do is deploy it back into our loan portfolio, but obviously we can't do that overnight. and so we'll continue to put it in the investment portfolio as we need to. also being mindful of the fact that if rates go up we do have to pay attention to unrealized losses and so we're trying to be careful there and make sure we're investing wisely.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. so, michelle just clarify maybe $700 million might be a longer term target, but i assume that will take a while to get there beyond just the back half of the year is that...
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think we're going to continue to have some excess liquidity through the remainder of this year, matt. it's probably a good outlook.
matt olney -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. that's all from me. thanks, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group. you may proceed with your question.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
hey, good morning, david and michelle.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, brett.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
wanted to ask, i joined a few minutes late, so you may have covered this to some degree, but wanted to ask about fee income and then i noticed that there was other kind of drop off a little bit, so i didn't know if there was anything of note there. and then, just wanted to ask about the mortgage banking outlook. and how you felt about gain on sale margins from here in production levels, obviously, you just comment on the warehouse.
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. mortgage has been impacted more from margin decreases. i think it's down about 30 basis points from q1, brett. and so their volumes are down just a bit, but they're really mostly being impacted by margin. the volumes are at least through the end of june, july have stayed pretty steady. and i really hope to give an outlook on mortgage, because it's volatile at times but i think probably q3 i would expect they will be similar to where they were in q2 and then generally fourth quarter is a bit seasonal and will go down a bit.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's what drove fee income.
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, right. that's primarily our fee income line is mortgage.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. and michelle, there was a little dip in other, was there anything noteworthy in the other bucket?
michelle hickox -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think the biggest thing in other has to do with some of our derivative mark to market spreads. so nothing really of note there. those can be volatile as well depending on where interest rates are.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. and then david, my other question was just, you gave some commentary around m&a that was helpful about the volatility of the bank stock market and that's what impacting maybe some stuff happening. is there anything else that's hindering more m&a happening in the stay, whether it's the sellers wanting to see if we can continue to strengthen or is there anything else that's really slowing down, which you would consider to be a more robust m&a environment?
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. you touched -- you just touched the other point i think and that is that the markets have really improved right and we didn't see, i think, another things factors, and we didn't see the credit problems or the depth of a recession that normally would have shaken, would have tested people's underwriting, put it that way and we didn't see that this time. and i really believed when we were talking a year ago that we -- i think everyone thought we were going to see more of a credit differentiation between different banks in their credit underwriting and all that and we didn't see that. and so i think that's allowed everyone to kind of continue to perform at a higher level.
and then i think people are generally optimistic right now about the future and so it's kind of like, wow, we've been through this difficult period of the pandemic, and now we're getting into the best economy and strong growth, especially for banks in texas and colorado, for example. the outlook is pretty good for banks. and so there is no real impetus in some cases that i think a lot of us expected a year ago that we would see a deep -- deeper more pressure on banks' loan portfolios, more pressure really kind of testing everyone's underwriting in the last two or three years and we didn't see that.
so there really hasn't been a differentiation on the credit side, which is good for the -- good for our business, good for banks overall and good for the economy, but it has continued to provide pretty solid ground for people to stand on. so there is no pressure i guess brett right now seems like for people to do anything. and so i think that's another thing is cash flowing down as people are going, gosh, it's sunny. the pathway ahead is sunny and let's kind of run our own company and see if we can do.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
yeah. okay, great. thanks for all the color.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james. you may proceed with your question.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to go back to loan growth, the core c&i, kind of ex-ppp and energy. it looks like that was a little over 40% of your growth this quarter, really strong. what drove that? was it increased line utilization picking up? we've seen that nudge up a little bit higher as just market share gains. and then any differentiation on the c&i side between denver and texas. thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, michael. i think it's really broad-based across c&i front. we have added new teams as we've talked about a new team members in texas and in denver. so really nothing that remark one of dan. we are getting a lot of traction in that c&i space where we've been hiring, but really not a lot of color michael that i can add other than we've just been gaining market share. the market is growing well. the new teams we've hired over and have brought new relationships with them and so we're seeing you at the margin that really is impacting our net loan growth.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and just to kind of follow up on that. so if i go back a couple of years pre the moe announcement that you guys have talked about one of the strategic initiatives as you got bigger was to grow c&i relative to commercial real estate, which is kind of being the company's bread and butter for a long period of time and get that cre concentration sub-300%. can you just give us -- and i know you're making progress. can you just give us an update on what the longer term expectations would be for the loan book and the complexion of it as we get into the next couple of years? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. and i think dan what are our numbers right now on the...
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman & chief risk officer
the 310% and 90% on the problem. we're at or below the thresholds.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we've come way down and balancing our book the last couple of years, michael. and so we're right on track with where we expect to be there. we've done that as we said, look, we've got to introduce a broader portfolio set other than just commercial -- cre commercial real estate lending and we've done that. we continue to do a great job in cre, continue to -- that's the bread and butter of regional community bank of course. but by introducing we've seen some traction in energy in the last couple of quarters. again selective high quality, but an opportunity to add there to a small book. same thing on commercial c&i. we've always had a good engine in colorado, but we've been building one in texas now. it's getting traction.
so those are the things that have allowed us to the balance up the book and i think you'll continue to see that become more balanced over time. and we'll book as we've talked about, michael. i know you and i've talked in the past. we would love an opportunity to acquire a bank that has a bigger c&i book or special product or something that they've got expertise and that would be additive to us similar to our guaranty acquisition where we picked up some expertise in retail, some expertise in middle market c&i, picked up a nice wealth management strategy. so acquisitions like that where we can pick up by a team, a company and a team that has maybe a little different skill set maybe than we had in the past and so that's what we're looking to do. i think we've been successful. we're right on track with where we hope to be three years ago when we began move in this direction and i think a couple of years you'll see us be even more balanced.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst
very helpful. and then maybe just finally for me another negative provision this quarter reserve release, the environment continues to improve here. i know there are some concerns about the delta variant and things like that. but it does seem like the reserve level has room to come down. could we potentially see some additional releases as we move forward? and just remind us where you were post day one cecl and if you think you can get back there may be potentially below just given the improving outlook. thanks.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman & chief risk officer
michael, this is dan. i'll take that one. our intention, as we've said in the past, is always to continue to grow into what the cecl reserve is today. you're correct, the credit provision that we took during the quarter was clearly driven by the improvement in the moody's forecast that we all work toward and i would say will continue to monitor what moody's does as it relates to the delta variant. but what i think is the best way to say it is based on what we know today, no new provisions are expected in the latter half of the year and we'll have to continue to monitor what economic conditions do and determine what impact that would have. but we expect no additional new provisions and we'll monitor what moody's does and the impact of that as it relates to future quarters.
michael rose -- raymond james -- analyst

david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. our company's second quarter results represent a strong return to organic growth with our teams delivering 12.4% annualized growth in our core loan book for the quarter as the texas and colorado economies continue to rebound. this loan growth is both broad-based geographically across our markets, as well as in terms of product type. most importantly, this growth represents the disciplined execution of our teams in building relationships, winning business and taking care of our customers.
for the second quarter, we reported eps of a $1.35, group tangible book value per share and maintained robust liquidity. additionally, credit metrics remain resilient with non-performing assets representing just 29 basis points of total assets at june 30. given the strength of our company's position, our board has elected to again raise the dividend to $0.34 per share in line with our long-standing philosophy of providing returns to our shareholders.
and with that overview, i will now turn the call over to michelle for more detail on the operating results for the quarter.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david. good morning, everyone. selected financial data for the quarter is on slide 6. our second quarter adjusted net income was $58.2 million or a $1.35 per diluted share compared with $49.1 million or $0.90 per diluted share for the second quarter last year and $60.1 million or $1.39 per diluted share for the linked quarter. net interest income was $129.3 million in the second quarter, up from $128.4 million in the second quarter last year and down slightly from $129.7 million in the linked quarter. the slight reduction in net interest income over the linked quarter was primarily due to lower accretion income, which was $5.2 million in the second quarter compared to $6.2 million in q1. this decrease was partially offset by interest income on loan growth in the securities portfolio.
ppp fees of $5.1 million were recognized in q2 versus $4.8 million in q1 with approximately $10.5 million of fees remaining to be recognized. we estimate around half of these will be recognized in 2021 with the remainder in early 2022. the adjusted nim excluding all loan accretion was 3.02% for the second quarter compared with 3.29% from the second quarter last year and 3.13% in the linked quarter. the margin decreased by 11 basis points from the linked quarter, due primarily to continued increases in levels of liquidity which impacted the margin by 15 basis points. the average loan yield increased 3 basis points from q1 excluding the impact of accretion.
total noninterest income was $15.9 million for the second quarter compared to $18.6 million in the linked quarter. the reduction in noninterest income over the linked quarter is due to lower origination volumes in the retail mortgage operation coupled with compression in gain on sale margins. noninterest expense totaled $78 million for the second quarter, an increase of $2.9 million over the linked quarter, which was primarily driven by increases of $1.2 million of occupancy and $1.4 million other noninterest expense.
occupancy expense was up due to completion of several branch refresh during the quarter as well as an unusual amount of small equipment purchases for upgrades and return to work. i do not expect that to recur at that level. other noninterest expense includes an increase in operations losses of $261,000, loan-related expenses of $365,000 and $422,000 in travel and entertainment expense as relationship managers return to meeting with customers on more normalized levels. there is approximately $1.3 million of consulting and contract labor expense related to ppp forgiveness in the quarterly run rate that will continue through 2021.
slide 19 shows our deposit mix and cost. total deposits were $15.1 billion as of quarter end with total noninterest bearing deposits up by $168 million from linked quarter and $650 million in the second quarter of 2020. we brought back $350 million of reciprocal deposits that were off-balance sheet at march 31, 2021. those were offset by decreases in specialty treasury deposits including broker-dealer and correspondents that were earning higher rates than desired.
capital ratios are presented on slide 21. in the second quarter, the company's consolidated capital ratios continued to grow with the common equity tier 1 capital ratio increasing by 20 basis points to 11.14% and the total capital ratio increasing by 10 basis points to 14.23% for the quarter. we call the $40 million tranche of subordinated debt last week on july 20th that had a rate of 5.75%. this had minimal impact on pro forma capital ratios.
that concludes my comments. i will now turn it over to dan to discuss the loan portfolio.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman & chief risk officer
thanks, michelle. overall loans held for investment excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans were $11.6 billion at quarter end compared to $11.7 billion in the linked quarter. excluding the impact of ppp loans, core loans held for investment increased by $333 million over the linked quarter. as david mentioned, this loan growth was driven by broad-based relationship lending to our customers across texas and colorado and was underwritten with the same discipline on rates and structure that has guided our bank for over three decades.
ppp loans on balance sheet totaled $490.5 million at quarter end, down from $912.2 million in the linked quarter. average mortgage warehouse purchase loans decreased to $850.5 million for the quarter, reflecting the reduction in demand versus prior quarters in line with the broader mortgage market. overall, our credit quality metrics continued to remain strong with total nonperforming assets of $53.1 million or 0.29% of total assets at june 30, 2021.
net charge-offs were 13 basis points annualized for the second quarter and were primarily driven by the charge-off of two commercial credits that had been previously reserved for. at june 30, 2021 the cecl allowance for credit losses on loans is $154.8 million or 1.40% of loans held for investment excluding ppp and mortgage warehouse loans. these are all the comments i have related to the loan portfolio this morning.
so, with that, i'll turn it back over to david.
david r. brooks -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, dan. as we enter the second half of 2021, loan demand remains strong and we anticipate that we'll be able to achieve high single-digit loan growth for the remainder of the year. in addition to this continued organic growth, we are well-positioned to capitalize on strategic, financially attractive and well-structured m&a transactions as the opportunities themselves. our company operates in four of the strongest markets in the country and looking ahead we remain committed to the disciplined execution of our strategy to grow opportunistically, especially as the texas and colorado economies continue to be supported by strong secular tailwinds, attracting capital and talent.
thank you for taking the time to join us today. we'll now open the line to questions. operator?

operator
thank you. we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] one moment please, while we poll for your questions.
our first questions come from the line of michael young with truist securities. please proceed with your questions.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
wanted to just start off on the loan growth side. you mentioned that some of it was a little slower, but curious what you're seeing now as we kind of head into the fall. and would you expect higher growth in the fourth quarter to kind of get you to that high single-digit level that you talked about maybe in the back half? just any updated thoughts or color around pipeline. all of that would be helpful.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i think if you look at our second quarter growth, michael, around 12; this quarter, around 5. that was -- production was pretty close in the third quarter than what it was in the second quarter, but we had a pretty significant pickup in pay-downs and again, that is just, happened cyclical gains, hard to predict. but that said, the pipeline looks really good for the fourth quarter so far. if we've grown 17% last two quarters, which average about 8.5%, then i think something like that, 8% or so, is what we're expecting, and then depending on the payout levels, it could vary a little from there, but we're still thinking high single digits in the fourth quarter, which would get us for q2, 3 and 4 on average 8% or better.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. thanks, david. that's helpful. and maybe one for michelle, just on expenses. you called out the higher ppp-related expenses and then some of the one-time senior management moves during the quarter. so, should we expect some of that $2.5 million or so to come back out, so we're closer to maybe $78 million, $78.5 million run rate from here?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think in the fourth quarter, michael, we're going to have about $1.3 million of ppp expenses come out of the run rate. we did have unusually high bonus expense related to some senior positions we added, but i wouldn't say pull that out at this point, because we are continuing to add people and the end of the year makes it a little more difficult to bring people on without paying the signing bonuses. so, i think i would stick closer to $79 million for fourth quarter.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. i'll hop back.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler. please proceed with your questions.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, brad.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
david or dan, i was just curious if you guys could talk about the new loans that are coming on the books, kind of what rates you're seeing in terms of new loan generation? and then maybe as a follow-up for michelle, if we were to get an increase in the fed funds rate later next year, what do you think ibtx's leverage would be? 25, 50, 75 basis points higher fed funds rate in terms of the margin?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
brad, this is david. let me start out saying that one of our takeaways from the quarter was that the pricing pressure on the new loans coming on is a little more significant than we felt like -- than what we've really seen earlier in the year. and -- so, that affected our yields a little more than we expected as well. so, we're seeing things in from 3.5% to 4% of the broad range, but -- whereas i felt like earlier in the year, on balance, we were booking loans in the upper threes and i felt like were down 10 to 20 basis points from that of what the book that you're putting on in the third quarter. dan can give any additional color there, but...
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
no, i don't have any additional color to add on to that, dave.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. so, that's kind of what i think on the loan yields, brad. just a little tougher sledding and maybe a little more headwind there than we'd expected. but -- so...
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think -- as it relates to your question about nim, brad, i think the real question is, with all the liquidity in the market, how much that funds increase is going to impact longer term rates. and i'm not sure -- we are currently more asset sensitive than we have been since i've been here, maybe the history of the bank. so, we will benefit from a fed funds increase, but i'm really not sure how much that will impact longer term rates at least in the next year, just given the liquidity in the market.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
michelle, that's helpful. would you anticipate -- with long rates up a bit here, would you anticipate you guys getting more aggressive and adding to the bond portfolio with some of your liquidity that you've got? i mean, i think on average, it was approaching $3 billion in the quarter?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we expect it to be over $2 billion by the end of this year. so, we continue to put money in the bond portfolio, especially considering that we continue to see deposits come in and liquidity is growing on our balance sheet. and i think we will continue to do that into '22, as long as it makes sense to offset loan growth. it really doesn't make sense to leave that money, sitting it fed earning 8 basis points. and i'm -- i guess i'm more convinced now that the liquidity is going to stick around maybe longer than i thought a year ago.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
and to be clear, you expect liquidity to be closer to $2 billion or the bond portfolio to be closer to $2 billion?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the bond portfolio will be a little over $2 billion at the end of the year, and then i expect that we'll continue to grow it through '22 relative to the balance sheet.
brad milsaps -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. helpful. okay. and just final question for me. just curious if dan could offer any more color on the three loans that went to non-accrual this quarter, just any sense for loan to value. is there any kind of theme? just any other color that might give us a sense of kind of what -- how you guys are thinking about maybe loss rate through resolution there?
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
yeah, i think, brad, in the normal course of resolving credits, in some cases, you'll have a pay-off and in other, you'll see an upgrade and in some cases, they will actually migrate into the non-accrual category because of their longer resolution. i would say the credits that migrated in the third quarter were not unusual in any regard with material equity and on. and so, our expectation is that there would not be any loss exposure that's not accounted for in cecl. notably, those loans were already on the classified loan list and in total, when you take all of the non-accruals, that number remains at a low level really.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of brady gailey with kbw. please proceed with your questions.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, brady.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
i just wanted to start on the buyback. it was good to see you all be a little active there in the quarter, that you bought it back at basically two times tangible book value. i know the stock is higher than that today. so, how do you think about continued buybacks from here?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
brady, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to buy our stock back and given that the m&a activity has been slower than we expected, given that we continue to accumulate capital more quickly than we're able to grow the bank, if you will, or more quickly than we need to support the growth of the bank, that's the right way to say that, and we're going to continue to do that. we have our board meeting later in the week. so, we're not -- the board will decide the dividend later in the week, but we're going to continue to look at opportunities to get back and we're going to continue to be active and opportunistic and just depending on how the stock's trading.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
got it, all right. and then on the energy front, i know energy lending is not a big piece of what you guys do. i mean, it's still only 2% of loans. it is up kind of $80 million in the last couple of quarters, that has gone from $200 million to $240 million to now $280 million. should we think about the energy portfolio kind of continuing to expand at a pretty nice clip here?
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
yeah, i think, brady, this is dan, i would view that as just a continuation of the efforts that we've applied with our team that was added a couple of years ago that came out of one of our peer banks. and they've had opportunity really to get engaged in significant great credits that have afforded us the opportunity to be a part of those. i think we will continue to see some growth in there. i don't think it will be outsized. i think it will be comparable to what we've seen as those opportunities present themselves to us. so, there will be some growth. i don't think i would consider that to be any acceleration of that growth.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and then finally for me, david, just on m&a. you just mentioned that's been a little slower than maybe you guys had thought. we saw a big splash of a deal with johnny allison and brian happy [phonetic], which i thought may have been a good deal for you all just given all the excess funding that could have brought to independent, but maybe just a general update on m&a, why do you think it's been slower, and do you guys remain active in chasing targets?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say it this way. brady. we will remain active in engaging relationships with smaller banks that we admire, that are in our footprint, that are in higher growth markets. that's one of the challenges. if you acquire a large-to-your-balance sheet footprint that's not in the growth market, then you really, i think, limit your growth opportunities going forward. liquidity is important. core deposits are critically important. but as michelle was mentioning, we've been, we think, -- felt like we are being aggressive this year and adding to our bond portfolio, our loan growth has returned to more historical levels and we're still sitting on $3 billion of liquidity. we came into the year hoping that we can deploy that and get that down to a lesser number, hasn't happened. so, that gives us an opportunity, as well, to think about the funding side of the balance sheet and can we or the things we can do to improve our cost of funds. and so, we're looking at all those, evaluating all those opportunities. and so, i would -- yes, certainly, acquisitions have been a part of our track record. we continue to be interested in growing, but our focus has been, as we've talked about this morning, on organic growth, on really building an infrastructure, making sure that we position the company to be in great shape or whenever that next opportunity comes along. and -- so, that's really been our focus and -- focus of our time and of our non-interest expenses.
brady gailey -- kbw -- analyst
okay, got it. thanks, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brady.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group. please proceed with your questions.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
hey, good morning, david and michelle.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
wanted to go back to the securities portfolio question, michelle. and just talking about, you mentioned that it would be $2 billion by the end of the year, was curious what you had bought during 3q and then what you're looking at and what you -- how do you think that might impact the bond portfolio yield and then kind of as it relates to that, it would seem like your margin would actually potentially move up if you're deploying excess liquidity that's yielding 10 basis points to something north of 1%? any thoughts on that as well?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's true, if we can finally get ahead of the liquidity. right? our bond portfolio is very conservative, brett. we continue to buy mortgage-backed agencies. i think we even bought some treasuries this quarter. and generally, those yields have been averaging 130 [phonetic]. and so, i think the current yield in our portfolios is a little less than 2%. so, it has trended down this year, but as you say, it is a lot better than the 8 basis points that we can earn instead.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. so, any thoughts on the margin potentially at least having some offset to lower loan yield production going forward?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i've kind of got not the business of predicting the margins just because it looks -- might be wrong or year long. and that's continued to push it down. as david said, we're continuing to look at ways that we could possibly continue to push our cost of funds down. if we could redeploy the liquidity even into the investment portfolio, that would be an offset or even better will be deploying it into loans. so, i think there is some upside, but i'm not going to predict that the margin is going to increase at this point.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
yeah, fair enough. i know it's been hard to predict with liquidity rising. the other thing i was curious about...
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
what i would...
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
i'm sorry. go ahead, michelle.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i am sorry. i mean, what i would continue to emphasize is that we are just looking at ways to grow rather than focusing on margin. looking at ways to grow net interest income. right? and then letting the mark-to-market build up.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. and then david, you gave an outlook for the fourth quarter around loan growth. and i guess one of the things i was curious about was to the increase in the unfunded commitment reserve, 6.1 versus 1.7 in the prior quarter for construction and energy. and so, i'm curious, as we think about 2022, would seem like construction could be a category that grows, any thoughts on where the portfolio might be growing more from here? is it construction? is it what you've been wanting to grow, c&i? what are the buckets that you think will have more growth as we go into next year?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
my suspicion, brett, is that we're going to see a balance. continued balance in the growth that we're seeing is really not one area that we're focused on. we're seeing more opportunities there. certainly, a lot of construction going on in denver and colorado front range and all our texas markets by via virtue if you drive around there, a lot of cranes and things. so, construction is a part of what we're seeing. but i don't think of it as being dominant. i'd say the biggest change, if there is a change in our mix, is that c&i is really picking up and kicking in. the people we've hired, the great teams that we've hired across texas and adding to our team in colorado are really getting some traction and we expect that to be a big part of what we see in fourth quarter and really in '22 and beyond. strong growth there. and then, it really just what we've always done well, which is strong real estate and small business lending and medical practice lending and all those things that we've done well. and the real estate really across the board, mckinney. because of our airport here, as an example, we're seeing tremendous industrial growth out by the airport, a new amazon facility there and people opting to bring their goods through mckinney's airport as opposed to dfw or love field. so, those are just some of the -- a little bit of color behind what we're seeing, but good balance across the portfolio on growth.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the color there. and then maybe just the last thing, around the mortgage warehouse. would assume that seasonality plays its usual impact in the fourth quarter. any sense of the magnitude that you're looking at in terms of how that might play out?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
as you're out with seasonality, you could see their average balances drop a bit, but i think they've done a good job of adding some new customers. and so, we still think that $800 million average is best for this quarter.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay, great. appreciate all the color.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brett.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next questions come from the line of matt olney with stephens. please proceed with your questions.
matt olney -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks, guys. wanted just to stick on the mortgage warehouse discussion. david, you mentioned the comments about loan yield pressure in the third quarter versus the first half of the year. i assume that was more on traditional commercial loans. if so, any comments about warehouse yield pressure? thanks.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. my comments were more based upon our traditional commercial loan strategy. i do think there's been a lot of competition in the mortgage warehouse that michelle have a] had a handle on their yields compared.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think that has come down a bit and from the beginning of the year, but i don't know that it's that significant.
matt olney -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then michelle, circling back to the commentary about the investment securities portfolio and maybe adding in some more balance to the fourth quarter. i think right now, investment securities around 10% of earning assets. any more color as far as the tolerance of where this could go as we move into 2022?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we don't really have a limit. i think historically that balances run around 7% of our balance sheet just because we've had such a high loan-to-deposit ratio. we'll just -- we'll continue to evaluate that, matt, and fit any excess liquidity in there to offset the loan growth. so, it could grow to $2.5 billion by the end of next year, but really, we'll evaluate that as the year goes along.
matt olney -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah, understood. thank you. and then i guess my last question is around the allowance ratio. i think we're now at 134 [phonetic] once i strip out the warehouse and ppp. just trying to appreciate where this could go. i think the original cecl adoption allowance was around 137-ish [phonetic], but that did include maybe a pcd loan. so, how should we think about that reserve ratio over the next few quarters?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. matt, our take on it, as we've been saying, is that we'll grow into our asset quality trends. dan can share some of that here in a moment, but our asset quality trends, i think, will be a tailwind and then the economic factors that go into the model are going to be a tailwind, we think, in '22. so, we're -- as we look out at the loan growth rates we're looking at, with the information we have today, we're not expecting to take a material loan loss provision even in '22. and so, depending on the assumption for loan growth, we think loan growth in '22 of 7%, 8%, core loan growth in '22. and when we factor all that out, the loan loss reserve certainly will -- the ratio would dip down. dan, any comments you've got on the tailwinds? and -- but we certainly don't think we're going to need 134 [phonetic] and so, we're going to be willing to let that drift down. i don't -- we haven't ever talked about a lower limit, but obviously we're just going to work with cecl model and comply with whatever the results are as all the banks are doing. so, dan, any comments on that or...?
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
yeah, i would say, i think, as david said, the growth will naturally bring that down some, but we don't expect it to change a great deal in the course of the next year. i did want to circle back on the asset quality side. i think the bigger picture here beyond a couple of credits that were downgraded to non-performing in the quarter is the strength of asset quality here. overall, remains very strong. we indicated in 2020 mid-year that we expected the portfolio to perform very well during the course of recession and we did expect some grade migration that would be attributable to the deferrals. and i think that is, in fact, what we saw in 2020. and then earlier this year, we also said that we expected improvement in grades in the back half of this year and that is exactly what we're seeing. criticized and classified loans have steadily declined each of the last three quarters from pay-offs and upgrades with more in process for the next few quarters. in fact, we had a 15% decrease in criticized loans in q3 alone. overall, the non-accrual portfolio, we still expect several of those to resolve in the next few quarters with either no loss or any potential loss exposure already accounted for in the cecl reserve. so, as david indicated, we don't expect any material change or provisions to be made, especially with the tailwinds of improving economy.
matt olney -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, guys.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group. please proceed with your questions.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
hey, david. i just had one follow up around talent and you talked about doing some hiring, obviously, at the senior management level and doing some infrastructure build. can you maybe give us some color on how many lenders you've added this quarter or this year relative to the existing production base and how you think about that and maybe going forward as well?
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
brett, i actually don't have an updated number there. there has been activity and continuing activity weekly on that, but we've had hired a material number of new middle-market c&i lenders. our team in texas has expanded, continue to expand and we've added to our teams in houston, in dallas-fort worth and denver, colorado, a number of new team members there as well. so, i'm sorry, i don't have a number. we can get that back to you, brett, exactly what that -- what our net -- what our gross hires and what our net hires are for the year. but it's material and is part of the reason why we are continuing to be encouraged about our growth, even as we focus on infrastructure and making sure that we have our back of the house in order as well.
brett rabatin -- hovde group -- analyst
okay. thanks for that, david.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thanks, brett.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of michael young with truist securities. please proceed with your questions.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, thanks for the follow-up. just wanted to ask on the residential real estate portfolio. that's been sort of a trading or running off here over the last year, maybe plus a little bit. any just general thoughts on that just a duration risk kind of concern or could we expect that book to sort of flatten out or start to grow at any point in 2022? just thoughts around that would be helpful.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
i'll take that, michael. this is dan. the -- as you would expect with the rates down, we certainly saw some refinances out, which is why i think you've seen it decrease somewhat there. on those side, we would expect to continue to book those as we have historically. and i think the overall balance of that portfolio should remain pretty flat as we move forward. in the normal course, because of us providing mortgages to our customers that we know, they will acquire and then ultimately, from time to time, sell them or refinance them. so, the refinances may slow, but i expect that we won't see a big change in that portfolio balance as we move forward.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
there's been a little bit of headwind, michael, on -- in that particular portfolio. we had -- when we purchased guaranty bank in colorado, they had a relationship with the mortgage company there that they had taken a lot of larger single-family loans. and we didn't continue that relationship because we have our own mortgage entity. and so, a lot of those loans, as time went by, refinanced out and so that creates a headwind in that portfolio. i think, as dan said, we expect it to level out. and certainly, we'll be opportunistic to the ways to grow it a little bit, but that's not going to be a big part of our growth engine. but we also not expect it to be a lot of headwind.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, really helpful. and michelle, just as i look at expenses for 2022, kind of know the normal cadence and kind of growth rate that ibtx has experienced in the past, but obviously, inflation potentially is a risk factor to the expense picture. have you guys done any early work on that, or any thoughts high level just kind of on what that could mean for ibtx?
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we're actually in the process of finalizing our budget for next year right now, but i think, for your purposes, a 3% over total for the year '21 expenses is probably a good place to start.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, i appreciate the follow-up.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer

paul langdale -- senior vice president, director of corporate development

and with that, i'll turn it over to david.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. for the third quarter, we reported eps of $1.21 per share, group tangible book value of $34.79 per share and maintained healthy asset quality with net charge-offs near zero for the quarter. we are pleased to see the continuation of loan growth at about 5% for the quarter, which was consistent with our expectations of a slower summer being followed by accelerating demand into the fall. likewise, deposit growth remained strong at 12.1% annualized for the quarter, further bolstering our liquidity position and increasing our optionality in managing the funding costs. during the quarter, we also repurchased a total of 217,772 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69.80 per share. this is consistent with our long-standing commitment to return capital and deliver returns to our shareholders.
with that overview, i'll now turn the call over to michelle for more detail on the operating results for the quarter.
michelle s. hickox -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, david. good morning, everyone. note that slide 6 shows selected financial data for the quarter. our third quarter adjusted net income was $52.6 million or $1.22 per diluted share compared with $59.6 million or $1.38 per diluted share for the third quarter last year and $58.2 million or $1.35 per diluted share for the linked quarter. net interest income was $128.6 million in the third quarter compared to $132 million in the third quarter last year and down slightly from $129.3 million in the linked quarter. accretion income was down $1.2 million from the linked quarter and $3.2 million from the prior year and totaled $4 million in q3.
ppp fees were also lower at $4 million in q3 versus $5.1 million in q2. these decreases were partially offset by interest income on growth in the securities portfolio in interest-bearing cash. there are approximately $6.5 million of deferred ppp fees remaining to be recognized, and we expect 75% of that will be recognized in q4. the nim excluding accretion was 2.91%, down 11 basis points from the linked quarter. the decrease is primarily due to continued increases in liquidity, which impacted the margin by 7 basis points.
total non-interest income was $16.9 million for the third quarter, an increase of $970,000 compared to the linked quarter. the increase in non-interest income over the linked quarter is primarily due to an increase of $745,000 in mortgage banking revenue. non-interest expense totaled $80.6 million for the third quarter, an increase of $2.6 million over the linked quarter. this was driven by increases of $2.7 million in salary and benefit expense. this quarter includes unusually high expense for senior staff signing bonuses, as well as bonuses paid to employees that has leaned in on ppp. contract labor increased $550,000 from q2 due to the initiation of several infrastructure projects. in addition, deferred loan costs were down $890,000 from q2. as loan volume picks up, we would expect this to return to a normal run rate. expenses related to the ppp forgiveness continue to impact the non-interest expense run rate and totaled $2.1 million in q3, including consulting, contract labor and bonuses. ppp expenses should decrease significantly in q4 with only a small impact expected in 2022.
slide 19 shows our deposit mix and cost. total deposits were $15.5 billion as of quarter end, with total non-interest bearing deposits up by $279.1 million from the linked quarter and $726.4 million from the third quarter of 2020. interest-bearing deposit costs decreased from 45 basis points in q2 to 40 basis points in q3. with a sustained growth in our core deposits, we continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to optimize our funding costs where appropriate.
capital ratios are presented on slide 21. in the third quarter, the company's consolidated capital ratios remained strong with a common equity tier-1 capital ratio of 11.06% and a total capital ratio of 13.64%. as david mentioned, we repurchased $15.2 million or about 218,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter in addition to the redemption of a $40 million tranche of 5.75% subordinated debt.
that concludes my comments this morning. so, i will turn it over to dan to discuss the loan portfolio.
daniel w. brooks -- vice chairman
thanks, michelle. overall loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse purchase loans, were $11.5 billion at quarter end compared to $11.6 billion in the linked quarter. excluding the impact of ppp loans, core loans held for investment increased by $129.7 million over the linked quarter. loan growth continues to be driven by broad-based relationship lending to our customers across texas and colorado.
ppp loans on balance sheet totaled $243.9 million at quarter end, down from $490.5 million in the linked quarter. average mortgage warehouse purchase loans decreased slightly to $838.5 million for the quarter, but remained near the second-quarter average balance of $850.5 million.
credit quality metrics continue to remain strong overall. total nonperforming assets increased to $82.8 million or 0.44% of total assets at quarter end, which is due primarily to the addition of two commercial relationships totaling $17.8 million and one commercial real estate loan totaling $11.7 million. there were nearly zero net charge-offs for the third quarter. at september 30, 2021, the allowance for credit losses on loans is $150.3 million or 1.34% of loans held for investment, excluding ppp and mortgage warehouse loans.
these are all the comments i have related to the loan portfolio this morning. so with that, i'll turn it back over to david.
david r. brooks -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan. we remain encouraged by the loan growth prospects into the fourth quarter and our pipelines continue to be supported by strong demand from relationship borrowers across our footprint. we are also encouraged by the momentum building from the new hires we have made over the past year, especially when it comes to growing our middle market c&i business. in addition to this organic growth trajectory, we are continuing to invest in our infrastructure to ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic m&a opportunities when they present themselves. we have expanded our executive leadership team to include john turpen as chief risk officer, and we're pleased to announce promotion of michael hobbs to president and chief operating officer. these additions deepened our executive leadership team in preparation for continued growth into the future.
the texas and colorado economies remain two of the most attractive markets in the country, and our teams of bankers continue their disciplined approach of winning new business and expanding existing relationships each day. i'm grateful to all our employees for their tireless dedication to our customers and communities and i remain excited for the opportunities we see on the road ahead.
thank you for taking the time to join us today. we'll now open the line to questions. operator?
