good morning and welcome to the first interstate bancsystem, incorporated fourth quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, today's event is being recorded.
i'd now like to turn the conference over to lisa slyter-bray. please going ahead, ma'am.
lisa slyter-bray -- investor relations
thanks, rocco. good morning. thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
as we begin, please note that the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed by those statements. i'd like to direct all listeners to read the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and factors that could affect future results contained in our most recent annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and in our earnings release, as well as the risk factors identified in the annual report and our more recent periodic reports filed with the sec.
relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are included in the earnings release and in our sec filings. the company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made today. a copy of our earnings release, which contains non-gaap financial measures, is available on our website at fibk.com.
information regarding our use of the non-gaap financial measures may be found in the body of the earnings release and a reconciliation to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included at the end of the earnings release for your reference.
joining us from management this morning are kevin riley, our chief executive officer; and marcy mutch, our chief financial officer, along with other members from our management team.
at this time, i'll turn the call over to kevin riley. kevin?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, and thanks again to all of you for joining us on the call today. again this quarter, along with our earnings release, we have published an updated investor presentation that has some additional disclosures that we believe will be helpful. the presentation can be accessed on our investor relation website. and if you haven't downloaded a copy yet, i would encourage you to do so.
i'm going to start off today by providing an overview of the major highlights of the quarter, and then i'll turn the call over to marcy to provide more details on our financial results.
during the fourth quarter, we continued to see economic strength throughout our markets that resulted in high quality lending opportunities, significant inflows of core deposits, and a reduction of our problem loan categories. as a result, we delivered another strong quarter of earnings and pre-tax pre-provision income.
for the quarter, we generated net income of $46.9 million or $0.76 per share, and a pre-tax pre-provision income of $64.9 million. across our markets, employment levels are increasing and many of the commodity prices are at near or all time highs providing a boon for our ag borrowers. a mild winter has been a positive for this construction industry, but we have still received some snowing amount [phonetic] and the ski season has gone well helping our tourist industry.
as a result, we continue to see many of our commercial clients performing at record levels, and our retail clients having a lot of money in their pockets, which is generating strong inflows of core deposits. our total deposits increased at an annualized rate of 9.5% in the fourth quarter, with all the growth coming in our lower cost deposit categories. the one drawback to this is that companies are doing so well that they are awash in liquidity. they don't have to need to utilize their credit lines or take on new debt.
excluding ppp loans, we started to run-off in a material way in the fourth quarter. our loans held for investment balances increased at an annualized rate of 3.6% with a broad growth across our residential and commercial real estate portfolios. we made a decision to put more of our liquidity to work by retaining a greater portion of our residential mortgage loan production. by retaining these mortgage loans and also adding to our investment portfolio, we are able to utilize a strong deposit growth to increase our net interest income and positively impact earnings.
in the current environment, we believe this is the right strategy. we're willing to trade off a lower net interest margin to generate higher net interest income dollars. we had to view that deposits are our raw materials and we're not going to turn way, even though these low-cost funds are invested in the securities portfolio or residential mortgages at a relatively low rate. we'll take those incremental interest income dollars all day long.
the positive economic trends we are seeing in our markets are also driving improvements in our asset quality. for the third consecutive quarter, we had declines in both non-performing loans and non-performing assets, and also in the fourth quarter, our criticized loans were down in the quarter.
we also continued to see more of our loan deferrals returning to regular scheduled payments. at december 31, we only had $23.7 million of loans in deferral status and $9 million of our residential mortgages and forbearance. together, this is less than 0.25% of our outstanding loan balances. these positive trends in asset quality along with the significant reserve build we had earlier in the year resulted in a small provision requirement this quarter. our allowance coverage is relatively consistent with that of the prior quarter.
given our strong financial performance and low risk profile, we continue to have the ability to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. during the fourth quarter, we repurchased over 1 million shares of our common stock. and today we declared an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share, which is almost an 8% increase from last quarter's dividend, and a 21% increase from the third quarter of last year. we are committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment, consisting of organic growth, acquisitions, stock repurchases and quarterly dividends. we believe this will continue to have a positive impact to the total return that we generate for our shareholders.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to marcy, so she could provide a little more detail on our fourth quarter results. go ahead, marcy.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone. as i walk through our financial results, unless otherwise noted, all of the prior period comparisons will be with the third quarter of 2020.
i'll begin with our income statement. as with last quarter, we once again saw an increase in our net interest income, but the excess liquidity we continue to carry put additional pressure on our net interest margin. our net interest income increased by $5.4 million from the prior quarter as a result of the acceleration of fee income related to ppp loan forgiveness. ppp contributed $16.7 million of interest income in the fourth quarter, up from $10.6 million in the prior quarter.
on a reported basis, our net interest margin decreased 4 basis points to 3.25% in the fourth quarter. a decline of 17 basis points was the result of our continued deposit growth, which was deployed at lower yields in securities portfolio and held in cash. this was offset by the impact of ppp loans acceleration.
taking all the noise out from both accretion and the all-in impact of the ppp loan, the yield on loans were down about 9 basis points, which was offset by a drop in deposit costs of 4 basis points. in the near-term, we will be focused on putting a significant portion of our excess liquidity to work in the investment portfolio by the end of the first quarter, where we're getting average rates of around 1.1% on new purchases without significantly extending our duration, which is currently at about 3.3 years. as a result, we will likely see some continued modest pressure on our net interest margin until we see stronger loan growth.
our non-interest income decreased $10.8 million quarter-over-quarter to $33.9 million. this was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenues resulting from normal seasonal declines coupled with our decision to retain a greater portion of our loan production in our loan portfolio. the decision to retain these mortgages on our balance sheet had an impact of about $4.3 million to revenue or after tax about $0.05 per share, but it's provided us with an earning asset that will benefit us for years to come.
aside from the decline in mortgage banking revenue, the two other significant contributors to the decline in non-interest income were decrease of $2.3 million in swap fees and a decrease of $2.4 million related to reimbursement for taxes on a bank-owned life insurance policy that was rewritten last quarter. these declines were partially offset by higher payment services revenue as we continue to see a rebound in transaction volumes and from higher wealth management revenues due to improved market performance.
looking at 2021, we're expecting refinancing volumes in the mortgage business to decline about 50% and total production to decline about 30%. we're still projecting 2021 to be our second best year, it be hard to beat 2020. but we do expect the gain on sale margins to decline from last year's record levels as demand lessens. with the growth expected in other fee-generating areas, we believe our total non-interest income in 2021 will be at or modestly down from 2020 record levels.
moving to total non-interest expense, we had a decrease of $2.1 million from the prior quarter. this was primarily due to lower salaries and wage expense resulting from the one-time items that we discussed last quarter, leaving our normal run-rate flat quarter-over-quarter. looking at 2021, we continue to invest in initiatives that will support a growing company, identifying areas to reduce costs as an offset. as a result, we expect total expenses to be right at 1% higher in 2021.
moving to the balance sheet, our loans held for investment decreased $345 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to the forgiveness of approximately $425 million of ppp loans during the fourth quarter. the ppp loan forgiveness resulted in a decline in our commercial loan portfolio, which was partially offset by modest growth in our commercial real estate portfolio and the increase we saw in the residential real estate loans due to our decision to retain more of our production.
we saw modest declines this quarter in a number of other portfolios, including our indirect portfolio. after the indirect portfolio decline in 2019, we focused on expanding our dealer network across our footprint in 2020. we saw good results from this effort as our indirect balances increased by 3.6% through the first nine months of the year.
while we typically see declining indirect balances in the fourth quarter, inventory shortages also impacted our production levels this year. as inventory begins to build again, we should see improved loan volumes and expect similar growth in 2021 as we saw in 2020. credit performance in the indirect portfolio is good with the delinquency rate declining from 2019 levels and remaining below industry averages.
as of december 31, we had approximately $740 million of ppp loans remaining on our balance sheet, and our expectation is that the majority of these loans will receive forgiveness during the first quarter of 2021.
on the liability side, our deposits increased $335 million from the end of the prior quarter with most of the growth coming in interest-bearing demand and savings deposits.
moving to asset quality, we saw decreases in all of our problem asset categories. relative to the end of the third quarter, our non-performing loans declined $6.4 million, our non-performing assets declined $9.6 million and our criticized loans declined $37.2 million. our credit losses continued to be very manageable, which is $4.2 million of net charge-offs, representing just 16 basis points of average loans in the quarter. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.2 million, which reflects our improved asset quality. although this did not cover our net charge-offs in the quarter, our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment increased to 1.47%. when ppp loans are excluded, our allowance coverage was 1.59% as of december 31.
so after discussing our strong quarter, i will turn the call back over to kevin.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, marcy. i'm going to wrap up with a few comments about our outlook and priorities for 2021.
we feel good about how we are positioned and our opportunities to continue enhancing the value of our franchise going forward. as a starting point, when we look across our operations, we feel confident in our position and we are grateful not to have any significant legacy issues that we need to address that would distract us from our focus of driving profitable growth.
our credit is strong, so we don't need to resolve a bunch of problem [phonetic] loans. we aren't looking to run-off any portfolios of any meaningful size, we aren't looking to exit any business or lending areas. we have great leadership in place and a solid organizational structure. we feel good about our technology platform and we're thankful we're not facing a massive investment of time and money to get that up to speed. we are confident in the foundation we have put in place and now it's just about execution and capitalizing on our growth opportunities, like i always tell my executive team just don't screw it up.
we see positive trends in many of our markets in terms of population and employment growth, with idaho and oregon among the fastest growing states in the country. we believe the environment and the lifestyle our footprint offers is driving people and company to relocate to our markets. all of this growth provides more opportunity.
in this covid environment, our bankers are finding creative ways to attract [phonetic] the clients. we are making sure we have the right resources in place to meet their financial needs and are putting more focus on cross-selling efforts to demonstrate the advantage of our broad offering of products and services.
we will continue to leverage the robust technology platform we have built to refine our current digital capabilities and add new products. this will help us increase productivity, enhance efficiencies and improve revenue generation. we are happy with the digital application portals that we introduced in 2020 for business in consumer credit cards and residential mortgage loans. the digital channel will continue to generate a higher percentage of our overall production as time goes on.
and then in 2021, we will be initiating some digital marketing campaigns to attract additional volume to these channels. in may, we will launch a digital small business lending portal. we believe the ability to offer online small business lending has become table stakes and will improve our ability to add small business customers.
as i've talked about in the past, we're able to offer a highly automated ppp application process with banker interaction at key points, which led to our success in the first round of stimulus. now, we're using that portal to efficiently manage loan forgiveness process. for the new ppp program this year, we will have the same process in place. since this program is targeted at companies that had been a little bit more severely impacted by the pandemic, and we don't have a lot of those in our markets, we expect only a modest volumes that we saw compared to the first program.
excluding the impact of ppp, both in terms of loans for the first program running off and loans from the second program coming on the books, we expect loan growth for the year to be in the mid-single digit range. as been the case in the past few years, most of the growth is coming from the west division, while we expect demand division to be slightly up for the year.
as marty has said, we expect operating expenses to be relatively flat. so we should have good operating leverage as we continue growing the balance sheet and generating higher net interest income. this should translate into a solid year of earnings growth.
if the vaccine rollout and the stimulus continues to have a positive impact and drives continued economic recovery, it's likely that we will be in a position to release reserves this year which will be another driver of earnings growth. with another strong year expected, we believe that we'll be able to generate solid returns to our shareholders.
as we return to a more normalized environment, we're starting to see m&a discussions pickup. and we'll continue to look for opportunities to enhance our franchise value. we have built a highly scalable platform that could support a much larger bank and we want to take advantage of that, and continue using acquisitions to complement our organic growth and further increase our earnings power.
in closing, we believe we are in a really good spot, with good credit quality, good capital, good liquidity, good technology platform, good product development, our branch network and our personnel. and as a result, we are confident that we will continue to execute well our growth strategy, drive a higher level of earnings, return more capital to our shareholders and further enhance the value of our franchise in the years to come.
so with that, we'll open the call up for questions.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities. please go ahead.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jared.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jared.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
yeah, i guess first maybe just on the mortgages that you're retaining, what's the -- those 30-year fixed, what's the duration and i don't know if those can be the yield?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- go ahead, marcy.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
so, it's a mix. we're retaining some 10 and 15, but we're also retaining some 30. and the duration -- i mean, the yield on the 30-year loans is about 3.26%.okay. and then should that growth -- should we expect that growth sort of in the mix what we saw this quarter, or is that actually should not accelerate as an opportunity for the portfolio?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we'll continue this at about the same pace. as long as we have the excess liquidity that we have, we expect to continue that at the same pace in the next quarter or two.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
okay. and then just looking at the allowance, i mean your credit is really strong. you did -- you obviously built up a strong reserve. what's going to be the main drivers for you as to look to get back toward that maybe cecl day one level? is it just going to be the strength of the broader economy as we go through '21 or is it really going to be maybe longer than 2021 before we get back to maybe a day one level?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, jared, we're going to look at how is the vaccine rollout happening, is this virus get really contained? i think some people might be a little aggressive in the early stages. we don't know how this is all going to play out. so we're just being cautious. if the vaccine works and the virus kind of dissipates, then we'll feel more confident to see that the economy is growing and feel confident about our reserve levels that can be -- come down.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
okay. and then i guess just finally for me, looking at the commercial lending what would have to happen to maybe potentially see upside to that growth target? is it just customers have a lot of liquidity themselves and there's just not a lot of demand or is it again more of the broader economic backdrop? what could drive that potentially higher throughout the year?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, jared, we're seeing a lot of economic growth. i think we will know more as the weather kind of clears, but we're already seeing signs. we have a lot of people moving into our markets and we have a lot of companies relocate. so i think it's going to pick up if that continues. so it could be better if there's more in migration than we anticipate. so we're feeling good and we will know more and more as the weather kind of gets better.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities. -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
and our next question today comes from jackie bohlen of kbw. please go ahead.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
hi. good morning.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jackie.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jackie.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
just curious about your thoughts on the next round of stimulus, you're obviously having fantastic deposit growth. from preliminary demands that you might be getting from your customers, how does it seem like their appetite is for ppp? and then as a bit of a layout to that, what could that mean for additional deposit growth in the early part of this year?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question, jackie. i think that that is going to bring us more deposit growth. i would say that we're -- it's interesting because we're monitoring the number of people that are applying for the second round of ppp. and i would say on the numbers of loans we're running at right around 15%, but i think the dollars are coming up a little bit lighter than that. so it will provide us some deposit growth. as the government gives consumers extra money through stimulus and gives us the business, this should have a positive impact on our deposit growth.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and i mean i would guess other factors from 2020 just given the economic comments you have carried into '21 with retail and business remaining strong and continuing to drive deposit growth from that too. is that your assumption?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i'll go out on a limb here a little bit and say i think that we had a pretty strong tourist season last summer, and a lot of our companies did a lot of record sales in number of the industries because of pent-up demand. i think the tourist season is going to set a record this summer that will won't be met again for years to come. i just think it's going to be a big year for our markets and that could have a tremendous impact to our performance.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. okay, that's good color. thank you. and then just one last one, i know that loan purchases are not in your wheelhouse [phonetic] and you actually spent a long time divesting acquired loan purchases from cascade. just want to double check that that still remains the case, and you're going to use securities, purchases and retaining mortgages of liquidity deployment?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. jackie, we really don't look at purchasing loans as kind of part of our core business. i mean we would look at something if it came across our desk, we're never going to not look at anything. but i don't see us doing that. we'll just continue to retain mortgages and put the money to work in the investment portfolio.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the likelihood of that jackie is slim to none.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. i figured, but just wanted to double check. thank you.
operator
and our next question toady comes from levi posen with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is levi posen on for jeff rulis.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you bet. hi, levi.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
hi, levi.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. i was wondering if you guys had quantified the basis point impact to margin of the ppp forgiveness in the quarter?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so the basis point impact to margin of the accelerated fees was about 19 basis points.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then could you also speak to your loan pipelines now versus a quarter ago and within your loan growth outlook, maybe the segments that are driving that? thanks.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we see the pipeline similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. it's about the same rate. and i think some of the growth also -- in the fourth quarter, our ag borrowers paid down their lines [indecipherable] harvest their crops. so that's going to come back, they will start utilizing those lines as they plant their crops and stuff. so, we see that utilization go up. so it's pretty similar right now. but again -- so that's why we're pretty -- we feel good about because the last two quarters we did about mid-single digit growth. so that's why we feel good that, that could persist going into 2021. again all better off [phonetic] how robust the economy starts growing in our markets, but that's kind of what we're seeing right now.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. thank you for the color. that's it from me. i'll step back.
operator
and our next question today comes from andrew terrell with stephens. please go ahead.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
hey, good morning. can you just remind us how much in shares you have remaining under the current repurchase authorization? and then maybe just any update to kind of the appetite of how you're looking to do repurchases going forward, i guess, particularly given the growth outlook?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you know, there is about 540,000 shares remaining under the current...
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
marcy, we can't hear you.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
can you hear me now?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'll take it. so when we look at repurchases, i don't know exactly [phonetic] when we have still remaining, [indecipherable] but we look at our repurchase in the sense where we always talk about our payback period and we'll take [technical issues].
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i am too.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
hey, marcy, i can hear both of you guys.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. he can hear both of us. so it's about 540,000 shares remaining under the existing plan and so -- not much. and so again we look at our five-year payback period and we repurchase shares accordingly so.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
okay. one last housekeeping one. can you remind us how many or how much left [phonetic] you have in remaining ppp round one fees left to agreed [phonetic] to interest income?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's about $15 million.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
okay, perfect. thanks for taking the questions. i'll step back.
operator
and our next question today comes from matthew clark with piper sandler. please go ahead.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. marcy, can you confirm the -- on your fee income related guidance, what the base is that you're using for 2020? i think you said flat to up, but i have $169 million that would suggest a nice step-up from this latest quarter.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
on the fee income? non-interest...
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. i just wanted to clarify your fee income guidance and kind of the base revenue that you're using for 2020, just to confirm it?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, matt, we believe our mortgage banking revenue will be down, but that the other areas, wealth management, payment services will be up and kind of mitigate the decline in mortgage banking revenues. and so we really do think it will be closer to flat quarter-over-quarter, i mean year-over-year.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
okay. okay, got it. and then could you give us the weighted average rate on new loans? i know you gave us the new securities 1.1%, but just wanted to get the rate on new production as well.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, here, this was encouraging because it was actually up from last quarter and it was 4.04%. so, it was up about 8 basis points from the fourth quarter -- i mean from third quarter.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then the mid single-digit loan growth guidance, is that ex-ppp?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then can you just confirm the remaining net revenues you expect to realize from ppp?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the remaining fees on the book are about $15 million.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, just on m&a, i mean, you've seen -- are you seeing any opportunities, or are you looking to consider maybe acquiring a bank that has a much higher loan to deposit ratio kind of blend the two and help your excess liquidity position?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so i'm going to see if kevin can talk? are you on kevin? we're having a little bit of connection problem.
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
i'm on.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
did you hear the question?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
no, i just got on.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so, matt, can you repeat your question for kevin?
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
sure, sure. yeah, i was just asking, if you were considering or had an appetite to acquire a bank that's loaned up, you know that's got a high loan to deposit ratio that could help kind of rightsize your excess liquidity position?
kevin p. riley -- president and chief executive officer
we will look at banks that are loaned up. the question is, what would they loaned up with to asset quality good. so i mean, we'll look at all opportunities to see what they have, but if we have a bank that has a bigger growth market that could put these funds to work a lot better and we can in some of our markets will surely look at that acquisition as a possibility.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then do you have a limit on how large you would like your single family resi mortgage portfolio to get? i think it's around 15% today. is 20% the max or you don't feel like you will even get that close?
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. you know, we are looking at up to another $300 million, but kind of based on where our liquidity lands that's kind of up to $300 million additional, but not over that.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you.
marcy d. mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you bet.
operator

kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, and thanks again to all of you for joining us on the call today. again, this quarter, along with our earnings release, we have published an updated investor presentation that has some additional disclosures that we believe will be helpful. the presentation can be accessed on our investor website. and if you haven't downloaded a copy yet, i would encourage you to do so. i'm going to start off today by providing an overview of the major highlights of the quarter. and then i'll turn the call over to marcy to provide more detail on our financials the first quarter came in largely consistent with our expectations. we continue to see healthy economic activity throughout our markets, which resulted in strong deposit inflows, a positive impact on our fee-generating businesses and further reduction in all of our problem loan categories.
we executed well on our near-term strategy to support our net interest income by utilizing some of our excess liquidity to retain more of our residential mortgage production and increased purchases of securities in our investment portfolio. the additional revenue generated through this strategy, combined with the stable expense level, helped us to deliver another strong quarter of earnings for our shareholders. for the quarter, we generated net income of $51.4 million or $0.83 per share. loan balances were essentially flat to year-end, whereas most years, we've seen declines in balances during the first quarter. we believe this reflects the health of our markets and the increasing confidence that our clients have in the strength and sustainability of the broader economic recovery.
across our footprint, our clients are looking to invest in projects and put money to work that will help them capitalize on the improving economic environment. we will continue to see this most notably impacting our commercial construction loan balances, along with modest growth in commercial loans, excluding ppp loans and growth in our residential real estate portfolio. heading into the second quarter, we're already seeing promising growth, and we are focused on ensuring our speed to the final credit decision allows us to get deals done. we have adjusted to become more efficient in our underwriting and approval process and are winning deals without compromising on price or quality. we were also pleased with the execution of another successful round of ppp loan originations in the first quarter. the automated process we utilized in the first round continues to provide a very efficient access to this funding for existing and new clients. and we funded an additional $437 million in loans throughout the end -- through the end of march. we continue to be surprised at the pace of our deposit growth, which was over 25% on an annualized basis in the period, where we typically see balances decline. while some of this growth can be attributable to ppp loans and stimulus payments, we believe this continuous historical high level of growth reflects the health of our clients.
while we're able to put a substantial amount of liquidity to work in the first quarter, strong deposit inflows continues to leave us with high cash balances. consistent with our approach in the first quarter, we expect to retain more of our residential mortgage production in the second quarter. and we'll continue to add to the investment portfolio, although at a much more modest pace. the health of our markets is also reflected in our asset quality. across the board, we saw improvements in all of our problem loan categories. nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans, criticized loans and delinquent loans were all down from the end of the prior quarter. improved economic forecast, along with positive trends in asset quality, resulted in a negative provision for credit losses in the quarter and a small reserve release. although with an allowance of 1.38% of total loans or 1.51% when ppp loans are excluded, we still have a very high level of reserves that should enable us to keep our provision expense relatively low as we add to our loan balances in the future.
i'd like to add a little color about our footprint. over the last few weeks, i've had the opportunity to once again get out and visit some of our communities and our employees. what i've seen is that there's an overall optimism about the local economies and at the outlook for continued recovery throughout the summer. notably, the expectation of record tourism across our footprint continues to point toward increased revenues for sectors that were hit hard by the pandemic. unemployment in the northwest continues to be below national averages and average wages show signs of growth.
our states continued to benefit from positive in-migration with some of our midsized markets like rapid city showing hot residential housing trends with notable increases in building permits to address growing inventory shortages. billings, coeur d'alene and spokane all made the national news as they were in the top five metro market areas for homebuyers. montana saw its population grow by 9.6% and picked up a house seat based on the recent census data. oregon picked up a seat as well. in fact, based on the results of the last census, all of our states saw positive growth, with idaho reporting the strongest increase of over 18%. they are also showing 6% annualized growth so far in 2021.
the near-term future for the agriculture industry always also looks positive. federal programs provide substantial relief from the effects of the pandemic and have allowed farmers and ranchers to weather the effects of commodity prices and export tariffs. higher income levels have resulted in increased liquidity and capacity to pay down existing lines. lastly, our state and local governments have not experienced a severe shortfall in revenue that were predicted at the height of the pandemic, and are, in some cases, seeing benefits from increase in gross sales and additional tax revenues.
in summary, the strength of our markets and the momentum of our core business trends set us up well for accelerating core pre-provision net revenue growth for the rest of the year. now i'm going to go off the script for a second because i just wanted to say that i am more bullish about the future of the bank than i ever have been since i joined the company. and with that, i'm going to turn the call over to marcy to provide some additional detail on our financial results. marcy?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone.
as i walk through our financial results, unless otherwise noted, all of the prior period comparisons will be with the fourth quarter of 2020, and i'll begin with our income statement. our strong deposit inflows continue to generate excess liquidity that impacted our net interest margin. however, the increased retention of mortgage production and the growth in our investment portfolio helped us keep our net interest income, excluding ppp and accretion income, relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. on a gaap basis, our net interest income decreased by $7.7 million, all of which can be attributed to lower ppp fee income, lower accretion income on acquired loans and two fewer days in the quarter. relative to last quarter, ppp income was $4.4 million lower, accretion income was $800,000 lower and two fewer days in the quarter equated to $2.4 million on an operating basis. looking ahead, on an operating basis, excluding ppp income, we believe this quarter was the low watermark for net interest income, and we should see sequential improvement from here for the rest of the year.
on a reported basis, our net interest margin decreased 21 basis points to 3.04% in the first quarter, primarily due to less income derived from our ppp loans and a mix shift from loans to bonds invested at lower rates, exacerbated by the significant increase in earning assets as a result of our rapid deposit growth. taking out all the noise from both accretion and the all-in impact of the ppp loans, the yield on loans went down by approximately 10 basis points, which was partially offset by a two-basis-point drop in our average cost of funds.
the weighted average rate of new purchases in the investment portfolio was 1.19% in the first quarter. while the securities we have purchased in the first quarter have pushed our duration to slightly over four years as of the end of the quarter, we have a bias toward higher rates going forward. and so incremental purchases in the investment portfolio will be made with the goal of keeping our overall duration under four years.
our noninterest income increased $4.2 million quarter-over-quarter to $38.1 million. this was primarily due to a $5.9 million mortgage servicing rights impairment recovery. excluding this recovery, noninterest income was down from the prior quarter due to the typical seasonality we see in payment services revenue, lower service charges on deposit accounts attributable to fee waivers and healthy account balances, and lower gains on the sale of mortgage loans as a result of our decision to retain more of our production, which you can see very clearly on page 45 of the investor presentation.
at the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected our total gaap noninterest income to be at or modestly down from 2020, which assumed a modest msr impairment recapture over the course of the year. as a result of the decisions we made in the first quarter around fee waivers and home loan sales, we now expect our total full year gaap noninterest income to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year. going forward, we're seeing strong momentum in payments and wealth businesses, both of which should now outperform our original expectations. we also expect to return to more normal levels of mortgage production sold toward the end of the second quarter, which should generate a nice lift in mortgage banking revenue from first quarter levels. as such, the first quarter should be the low point for fee income, and we're still anticipating our total fee income for the remainder of the year to be consistent with our initial forecast in january. notably, this revised outlook assumes no further msr recovery for the balance of the year.
moving to noninterest expense. we had an increase of $1 million from the prior quarter. this was primarily due to higher employee benefits expenses resulting from the seasonal impact of higher payroll taxes. this was partially offset by lower salaries and wages expense due to lower commission expenses and short-term incentive accruals. while we had a large volume of ppp originations in the quarter, we allocate a very small amount of loan origination cost per loan in this program. the impact of the deferred loan costs related to ppp loans on our first quarter expenses was immaterial. for the full year, we continue to expect our initial guidance to hold true and for total noninterest expense to be approximately 1% higher than last year.
moving to the balance sheet. our loans held for investment increased $56 million from the end of the prior quarter. we had $372 million of ppp loans forgiven and funded $437 million of ppp loans in the quarter, with the remaining loans held for investment essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. growth in our residential real estate, construction and commercial portfolios was partially offset by declines in our commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. the decline in the indirect consumer portfolio continues to reflect elevated levels of payoffs and paydowns related to stimulus payments and new production has been dampened by inventory shortages at dealers. the demand for autos rvs and other recreational vehicles is definitely strong. and when inventory shortages are resolved, the large dealer network we've built should turn this area into another source of growth in the portfolio. as of march 31, we had approximately $804 million of ppp loans on our balance sheet with $29 million of associated deferred loan fees.
on the liability side, our total deposits increased $877 million from the end of the prior quarter, with most of the growth coming in noninterest-bearing commercial deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits and savings deposits. moving to asset quality. as kevin mentioned, we saw decreases in all of our problem loan asset categories. relative to the end of the fourth quarter, our nonperforming loans declined $6.6 million, our nonperforming assets declined $6.9 million and our criticized loans declined $30.7 million. our remaining loan deferrals are de minimis.
our credit losses continue to be very low with $2.9 million in net charge-offs, representing just 12 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis. following the significant build in our reserves during 2020, the improving economic forecast, improved asset quality and the low level of losses in the portfolio resulted in a reversal of provision expense of $5.1 million. this brought our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment to 1.38% as of march 31 or 1.51% when ppp loans are excluded.
now i'll turn the call back over to kevin.
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, marcy. nice job. i'm going to wrap up a few comments about the remainder of 2021 and how it's shaping up. our near-term focus will be continuing to support our net interest income by retaining mortgages and increasing our security portfolio, but we are becoming increasingly confident that we will see stronger loan growth for the remainder of the year, which will give us more opportunity to increase net interest income and further improve profitability.
credit line utilization is at historic low levels. we will see construction lines fund throughout the rest of the year, and we expect both consumer and commercial lines of credit to return to a more normalized level, which would reduce excess lines about 9%. if this materialize, this will result in about $200 million in increased outstanding balances. our loan pipeline is steady, and signs are pointing to higher demand in the coming months. we are seeing good opportunities across a variety of asset classes, both in the west and mountain division. we believe commercial construction will be an area of strength, and we're also seeing opportunities in residential construction as homebuilders look to satisfy the strong demand for housing resulting from the population growth in our markets. this also extends to multifamily lending, which is benefiting from the same in-migration trends.
the outlook for commercial real estate lending looks positive. we don't have much exposure to office -- the office market that has some people concerned about the long-term impact of work from home, and we're seeing good opportunities across other property types that continue to perform well. we fully expect a very strong tourism season this year, given the pent-up demand. it's very difficult to book a room at many tourist destinations in our markets right now. this is -- this only bodes well for fee income we generate from increased economic activity in our markets, but also for loan demand from a larger ecosystem of small businesses that serve the tourist market. and in may, we are launching our small business digital lending platform, which will improve our ability to serve small businesses and efficiently originate loans in this area.
this is just one of the technology rollouts this year. we just completed the installation of our integrated teller platform in our branches. and later this year, we will upgrade our debit card processing system and implement a new commercial loan origination system. all of these technologies enhancements are driving improved efficiencies, providing more opportunity for revenue generation and improving our client experience. this is a continuation of our efforts to consistently enhance our people, processes and technology and do it without having a material impact on expense levels.
on the people front, we had john stewart join the team as deputy cfo and head of ir. we know many of you know john, and we are excited that he has chosen to cross over to the bright side of the business. so you will see him around as he will be joining marcy and me in many of the upcoming investor events. the investments we have made in prior years in processes and technology to build a robust, scalable technology platform are enabling us to consistently add new features and tools that will improve our operation without much incremental expense. we believe this positions us very well to realize more operating leverage as we continue to grow the company, both organically and through additional acquisitions.
before i wrap up today, i want to note that we recently published our 2021 community responsibility report, which is available on our website. and i encourage anyone who is interested in understanding our company better from an esg perspective to download a copy. we've been publishing a similar report for several years, and the commitment to corporate social responsibility is just something that is in our dna. being a good corporate citizen and a valued partner to our communities has been a core value of first interstate for decades, and taking care of our employees, clients and neighbors will continue to be an integral part to the success and the growth of our future.
so with that, i'll open call up to questions.

operator instructions] today's first question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities. please go ahead
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning everybody, kevin, maybe just starting with the -- some of those tech investments and especially the small business lending portal. i guess, how will that be -- how do you see that helping to drive additional business? and will that enable you, i guess, to take some of the leads from the ppp, maybe from other banks' customers? and do you expect to have that help develop them into full-service customers at a faster pace than before?
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there's two things that we see benefit, jared. one, that people can go online and apply for a loan themselves and be immediately approved and funded because it has an automatic scoring process, so it's a fast, efficient way for them to do it themselves. or we're also training our fsrs, which are not commercial lenders. fsrs, financial service reps, to be able to walk customers through this digital application within some of the locations that might not have commercial lenders to quickly get loans approved and funded.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. great. and then on the mortgage side, are you retaining everything that you're producing at this point? or are you trying to keep a shorter -- you do it looking at 15-year, you're holding on to 30-year as well? and i guess, how will that impact mortgage banking revenue going forward in terms of volume retained versus sold?
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
marcy is going to answer that question.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes. so jared, in the first quarter, we retained about 58% of our production in the portfolio, and some of that did include the 30-year mortgage product. going forward, we'll begin to phase out of that headed into the end of the second quarter. so again, we had a certain amount that we were going to retain around $400 million throughout this whole process since we started retaining mortgages in the fourth quarter, and we're about at that threshold. so we'll begin to sell mortgages, sell more of our production as we head into the end of the second quarter.
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. and then just finally for me on credit, i guess, two things. one, should we expect that the negative provision this quarter sort of got you to where the current economic environment is reflective of? and any reduction of the acl will be more a function of loan growth at this point? or could there be another negative provision? and then sort of tying it to slide 21 in your slide deck, there was a construction loan that you highlight as management attention. it doesn't look like there was a reserve against that. can you just give a little color on that?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
so i'm going to let michael lugli ask -- answer that last question. but i'm hoping that we grow into the reserve balance where it is right now with loan growth. and i'm not anticipating any substantial change in our economic outlook until we -- unless we were to continue to see things markedly improve from here. and then -- does that answer that question, jared?
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. thanks
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
okay. and then michael?
michael lugli -- chief credit officer
hi jared, it's mike lugli. what you're referring to is the -- i believe, it's a commercial and institutional building construction and the management attention piece. that's primarily driven by a couple of hospitality loans that we are doing. and it's really not -- has nothing to do with the actual project but a weakness of the guarantor from other assets that they own, which is draining their liquidity. so given the uncertainty, that's why that was moved over to management attention. does that make sense to you or answer your question?
jared shaw -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. okay. and is there a specific reserve associated with that because of that risk rating? or not necessarily?
michael lugli -- chief credit officer
management attention is about as late as we get and criticized. so no, there is not. and we feel very good about the project. it is really just looking -- and we're looking at that hospitality book and office book closely. it's just looking at that guarantor that, out of caution, abundance of caution, we moved that to special mention.
operator
and our next question today comes from levi posen with d.a. davidson. please go ahead
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
kevin, marcy, this is levi on for jeff rulis. if i could just start with a housekeeping question on the tax rate. is it fair to assume that the seasonality we've seen in the past couple of years repeat this year? and we'd land toward the 23% for the full year?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes. i think we'll be between 22.5% and 23%. we always have some benefit that we see in the first quarter from the tax benefit associated with option exercises. and so that's what happens in the first quarter to drive that rate down a little bit.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you and then i apologize if i missed it -- missed it earlier, but was there an expense run rate going forward?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
1% increase year-over-year.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thank you and then last one for me, on the capital side of things. you guys have been active with buybacks and the dividend. what are your thoughts on m&a coming up here?
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're always, as you know, in the past, we're always talking to people about doing a possible acquisition. those conversations continue to be have -- had. but we're being pretty picky like we have in the past. i mean, there's a lot more coming to market right now. we're being called on. but we're not jumping to some of those because we have certain acquisitions that we believe will enhance the franchise value. and we believe just being patient is the position we're going to take at this juncture.
levi posen -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
understood. okay, thank you [indecipherable]
operator
our next question today comes from matthew clark of piper sandler. please go ahead
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning, marcy, do you have the weighted average rate on new loans this quarter ex ppp?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes, four 25%.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and i guess what i'm getting at is kind of the incremental core margin based on new business, new securities at 1.19, new loans at 4.25, maybe some -- the additional securities from here might be a little bit lower in that 1.19. assuming kind of a similar mix of assets, i mean, do you feel like we're kind of near the bottom here on the core nim? i know it's difficult to say, but...
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
i know. it is difficult to say. so just based on where we ended the quarter and then with the expectation that we're going into our stronger season where we could see some additional modest deposit growth, i think that we could possibly see a little bit more pressure on our core nim, just resulting from that mix shift.
so again, if we see folks spending money and deposits don't grow when we see higher loan growth, that could change that. but just on a core basis, i think we could see a little bit more pressure. not substantial, but a little bit.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. okay. and then can you quantify the gain in other income? i'm assuming it's about $2 million, but i just want to double check. other fee income.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
say that again, matt. i'm sorry.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
just looking to quantify the gain in other noninterest income this quarter. i think it was around...
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes. so the only non -- i guess, noncore gain that i'd see in there is we had about $750 million -- i mean, $750,000 gain on the deposit premium when we sold that wynwood branch. other than that, it's just the normal ins and outs of what we usually see in that line item.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just on the service charges and the fee waivers, i guess, i would have thought we'd kind of come to the end of that at this point. but any change in strategy there or rationale on waiving fees?
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
so again, when we had stimulus payments come into those accounts, we waived fees again this quarter, but we're no longer doing that. so going into the second quarter, we should see that return to more normalized levels.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, on the round two of ppp, are you using a five-year amortization life or something shorter? okay.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes. we're using five.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. thanks
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yup.

operator instructions] our next question today comes from jackie bohlen with kbw. please go ahead
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
hi, good morning. i wanted to pick up a little bit on matthew's question just in terms of service charges. in thinking about seasonality, i know you have a strong tourism season. last year, this year, equally strong, if not more so, i would guess. so just it's hard to tell the trends because of the pandemic and how that influenced activity. so i'm wondering what your expectations are for the pickup that we might see this summer if it's a more normalized trajectory than what we saw last year, understanding that fee waivers are stopping and there's a couple of things that play in there.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
so i think it's really hard to say, jackie. i agree with you because clients have more cash in their accounts as well. and so nsf charges are down. we -- i wouldn't expect the trend to be too much different than what we saw last year at this point. time will tell if things -- spending becomes more robust. but i would expect it to be close to what we saw last year.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just in terms of the strength of your customers and how that's driving some deposit volume. to the extent that net migration continues, i would expect economic activity to remain robust. is there anything that would stop that flow? and i know that this quarter had stimulus and everything involved too, but just thinking about it outside of that.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
no, i don't think there's anything that would stop that. i mean we're not trying to actively exit deposits from the bank.
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
no. and jackie, we're -- we usually decline in deposits in the first part of the year, and our growth of deposits starts like the mid-second quarter and the remainder of year. so we believe with the increase in economic activity, deposits should grow. the question is how fast do they grow? and do they grow at the pace they have been growing? but there's all anticipation that deposits will continue to grow. we just don't know how fast, because we're entering to the normalized season where deposits grow.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
and then we don't know how fast spending will pick up as well. so it's just kind of a new environment.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
yes. no, i get it. and i, myself, am just trying to wrap my arms around it. so your thoughts on that are helpful. thank you, everything else i had was already covered.
operator
and our next question comes from tim coffey with janney. please go ahead
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
thank you, morning everybody. kevin, kind of follow-up on your comments about the loan growth. i mean you're kind of -- your more bullish expectation going forward as sort of outlook. what do you think that translates into, say, loan growth for the rest of this year?
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're hoping that -- well, we believe definitely we'll meet the mid-single-digit level. it depends that we're now kind of moving toward maybe upper single digits in our expectations of growth for this year.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just on the msr recovery in the quarter. can you provide any color with that? is that just kind of -- your expectation is it's onetime thing? is it built up from previous impairments?
kevin p riley -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the thing is that we had previous impairments of last year due to the speed of prepayments, and we had to write down our msr. and we did give highlights that this year, that we'd probably see a recovery of that. so that's just part of writing it up and writing it down. so the thing is that we don't see any more really large recoveries of impairments for the remainder of the year. but it's just an accounting thing you have to go through where you write them down, you bring them back up. so it just puts noise in our numbers, which we don't like.
marcy d mutch -- executive vice president and chief financial officer investor relations
yes. so but on our prepared comments, we didn't factor any additional recovery into the run rate of noninterest income going forward.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
yup great. [indecipherable] thanks a lot those are my questions.

good day, and welcome to the first interstate bancsystem's second quarter earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note today's event is being recorded.
i'd now like to hand the conference over to lisa slyter-bray. please go ahead, ma'am.
lisa slyter-bray -- executive assistant
thanks, rocco. good morning. thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. as we begin, please note that the information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed by those statements. i'd like to direct all listeners to read the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and factors that could affect future results contained in our most recent annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and in our earnings release as well as the risk factors identified in the annual report, and our more recent periodic reports filed with the sec.
relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are included in the earnings release and in our sec filing. the company does not undertake to update any of the forward-looking statements made today. a copy of our earnings release, which contains non-gaap financial measures is available on our website at fibk.com. information regarding our use of the non-gaap financial measures may be found in the body of the earnings release and a reconciliation to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included at the end of the earnings release for reference. joining us from management this morning are kevin riley, our chief executive officer, and marcy mutch, our chief financial officer along with other members of our management team.
at this time, i'll turn the call over to kevin riley. kevin?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, and thanks again to all of you for joining us on our call today. again, this quarter, along with our earnings release, we have published an updated investor presentation that has some additional disclosures that we believe will be helpful. the presentation can be accessed on our investor relations website, and if you have not downloaded a copy yet i encourage you to do so. i'm going to start today by providing an overview of the major highlights for the quarter, and then i'll turn the call over to marcy so she can provide more details on our financials.
during the second quarter, we generated net income of $42.5 million or $0.69 per diluted shares while delivering everything we discussed last quarter. excluding ppp loans, we generated upper-single digit annualized loan growth, higher levels of net interest income and fee income on a run rate basis, well-controlled expenses and excellent credit metrics. we saw an acceleration of positive trends we experienced early in the year, driven by healthy economic activity throughout our markets. this resulted in yet another quarter of strong deposit inflows, which grew by 12.4% annualized in the quarter. non-interest bearing deposits alone grew $413 million or 33% on an annualized basis. we continue to utilize these strong deposit inflows to grow earning assets, both in loans and investment securities, which produced an expected increase in our net interest income excluding the impact of ppp fees.
across our footprint we have been able to effectively capitalize on high -- higher loan demand we are now seeing and grew our total loan balances, excluding ppp at an annualized rate of approximately 9%, which is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. notably, we are seeing balanced contributions to growth across almost all of our portfolios and markets as our clients continue to look for attractive opportunities to invest into this robust economic environment in the states we serve. our western markets continue to produce our strongest growth rates, but we are now seeing real improvement in our eastern markets as well. encouragingly, we saw our commercial portfolio, excluding ppp loans increase at an annualized rate of approximately 3%, which is the first quarter of substantial growth we have experienced in this portfolio since the pandemic started. this growth came despite line utilization remaining relatively unchanged, and still well below historic norms.
heading into the second half of the year, we are continually focused around speed to market, more efficient underwriting, and we are expecting the recent growth trends to continue allowing us to come in at or above mid-single-digit range we originally expected for the year. our continued deposit growth should enable us to put more liquidity to work in our investment portfolio than we initially expected, the details of which marcy will discuss later. we will do this, however, at a much shorter durations to retain our assets sensitivity position.
the health of our markets is evident -- also evident in the continued across the board improvement in our asset quality. non-performing assets, non-performing loans, delinquent loans, and criticized loans were all down. net charge-offs annualized at a percentage of average loans was only 4 basis points. nevertheless, we continue to take a cautious approach and maintain a healthy reserve, which remains at 1.3% of loans held for investment and is at 1.46% excluding ppp loans.
as i usually do, i would like to add some additional color about our footprint. the local optimism i noted last quarter continues to be evident across our footprint. tourism is having a record season as we expected to see. the parks and the surrounding hotels are full and the businesses are seeing activity also follow. in april i noted the positive in-migration trends across our states, which was confirmed in the last census. however, just last week the wall street journal listed billings, montana -- yes, billings, montana, the new #1 market on the emerging housing market index, which rates the markets by low unemployment, affordability and attractiveness to the outdoor lifestyle. this continues to attract new residents from all over the country.
in fact, we serve three of the top five markets on the list. billings, montana, number one; coeur d'alene, idaho, number two and rapid city, south dakota, number four. in short, the bullishness i expressed in april about our markets and the future of the company has been solidified over the last 3 months, and the momentum of our business sets us up for a strong second half of the year. we are expecting solid loan growth, solid operating pre-provision net revenue improvement and strong credit results to drive further improvements in our profitability metrics.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to marcy so she could provide more details on the quarter. go ahead, marcy.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone. as i walk through our financial results, unless otherwise noted, all of the prior period comparisons will be with the first quarter of 2021, and i'll begin with our income statement.
as previously stated, our priority in the current operating environment is to utilize our strong deposit inflows to grow earning assets and support net interest income. excluding ppp impact, our second quarter results reflect our execution on this strategy, which generated the growth in net interest income we told you to expect last quarter. on a gaap basis, our net interest income decreased by $1.9 million as a result of lower ppp fee income, which declined by $4.5 million from last quarter. accretion income was just $200,000 higher on a linked quarter basis. excluding the impact of ppp, our net interest income increased by 2.4% or 9.5% annualized. the increase was attributable to growth in both average loans and investment securities during the quarter.
looking ahead on an operating basis, excluding ppp income, we would expect to see even more improvement in net interest income heading into the second half of the year. with the continued robust growth in deposits, the net interest margin continues to be a challenge. on a reported basis, our net interest margin decreased 22 basis points to 2.82% in the second quarter. this was primarily due to less income derived from our ppp loans, which was about half of the decline and a mix shift toward investment securities at lower rates. the lower rates on the investment securities reflect a full quarter impact of investments made in the first quarter at an average yield of 1.19% and then new securities added during the second quarter at an average yield of 93 basis points. at 4.26%, our average loan yields, excluding ppp impacts, were essentially unchanged from the first quarter.
although the spread between our book yield and new production continues to narrow, we did benefit this quarter from an adjustment to our indirect auto dealer reserve, which added a few basis points to our average yield that's not expected to carry forward. with the continued inflow of non-interest bearing deposits, our total cost of funds declined by 1 basis points to 11 basis points in the second quarter.
as you can see on page 27 of the investor presentation, the duration of the securities portfolio was shortened to 4 years from 4.3 years at the end of the first quarter. with the increase we've had and the size of the investment portfolio, we've taken a few actions designed to minimize the potential impact to our capital ratios and increase the earnings power of our cash position, which puts the effective duration at the end of the second quarter at 3.75 years. in early june, we moved securities of approximately $670 million to the held-to-maturity portfolio. this has the effect of eliminating a significant portion of our estimated downside risk to tangible book value should rates begin to rise.
additionally, in mid-june, we purchased $500 million of 5 year treasury bonds yielding 87 basis points and then simultaneously initiated a $500 million 2 -year forward starting, 3-year pay-fixed swap at 1.19%. we'll begin receiving effective funds in addition to our original yield when the swap goes live on june 30, 2023. as a result of these actions, we've been able to execute our excess liquidity deployment strategy while protecting our capital and maintaining our targeted level of asset sensitivity.
our non-interest income decreased by $2.8 million quarter-over-quarter to $35.3 million. this was due to the $5.9 million mortgage servicing rights impairment recovery that we recorded last quarter. excluding the recovery, our quarter-over-quarter operating non-interest income increased primarily due to higher production-related revenue in the mortgage banking business as our retention program came to an end and the percentage of production sold increased. you can see this on page 36 of the investor deck.
in addition, payment services revenue continues to outperform our expectations as a result of the increased economic activity and higher business credit card volume. consistent with last quarter's guide, we continue to look for a strong second half of the year and expect our total full-year gaap non-interest income to be down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, excluding any additional impact to the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights.
moving to total non-interest expense. we had an increase of approximately $600,000 from the prior quarter. of note, during the quarter, we did experience about $1 million of expenses that we do not anticipate carrying forward into the run rate for the second half of the year. despite those added expenses this quarter, we still expect our gaap expenses for the full year to be approximately 1% higher than last year.
moving to the balance sheet, our loans held for investment decreased $29 million from the end of the prior quarter due to a net decline in ppp loans of approximately $230 million. excluding ppp loans and deferred fees, total loans held for investment were up about $200 million from the end of the prior quarter or 9% annualized. most of the growth came in commercial real estate, construction, residential real estate and in some non-ppp-related commercial loans. consumer loans continue to lag due to ongoing inventory shortages and higher-than-normal levels of payoff impacting our indirect portfolio. as of june 30, we had approximately $572 million of ppp loans on our balance sheet with $26.5 million of associated deferred loan fees.
on the liability side, our total deposits increased $472 million from the end of the prior quarter with $413 million of growth coming in noninterest-bearing deposits. and moving to asset quality again, we saw decreases in all of our problem asset categories. relative to the end of the first quarter, our non-performing loans declined $5.8 million, our non-performing assets declined $6 million and our criticized loans declined $38 million as a result of several upgrades in the ag and commercial real estate portfolios as well as payoffs on other criticized loans. our credit losses continue to be very low with $1.1 million of net charge-offs representing just 4 basis points annualized of average loans in the quarter.
and then following the significant build in our reserves during 2020, the improving economic forecast, improved asset quality and low levels of losses in the portfolio offset the provision requirement attributable to growth in the loan portfolio this quarter. as a result, we did not record any provision expense in the quarter. this kept our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment at 1.38% at june 30 unchanged from the end of the prior quarter. when ppp loans are excluded, our allowance represented 1.46% at june 30.
with that, i'll turn the call back over to kevin.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, marcy. nice job. i'll wrap up with a few comments about our outlook. so far the year has unfolded pretty much as we expected, if not a little bit more favorable particularly in terms of loan growth. as we look at the second half of the year, we expect a continuation of many positive trends. businesses in our markets are performing well. in particular in light of the strong tour season, they are generating strong cash flow and growing their deposit balances, which gives us the opportunity to continue to grow earning assets and to generate higher net interest income.
we are seeing good loan growth opportunities in almost all of our markets, and we feel good if not better about the outlook for loan growth than we did 3 months ago. real estate-related lending continues to see strong -- the strongest demand but commercial loan demand is starting to pick up as well. excluding ppp loans, we think our full year loan growth will exceed our original expectations with less growth from our -- in the second half of the year coming from our residential real estate portfolio.
in terms of fee income, as our guidance would suggest, we expect to have a good second half of the year. residential mortgage demand remains strong, and we were getting back to selling more of our production, and we expect to see a lift in our mortgage banking revenue. meanwhile, payment services and wealth management continues to deliver strong results. expenses remain well controlled, which should result in a nice improvement in our efficiency ratio in the second half of the year, and credit should continue to be very strong. collectively, we believe these trends should position us well to see solid earnings growth and noble -- a notable increase in pre-provision net revenue in the back half of the year. and with the foundation of the company being extremely strong from a capital, liquidity and credit perspective, we remain well positioned to execute on any attractive m&a transaction that we believe can further enhance the value of our franchise.
and so with that, i will open it up for -- the call for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] today's first question comes from jared shaw at wells fargo securities.
jared shaw -- wells fargo -- analyst
maybe starting with -- on the loan outlook side. with mortgages here you're going to retain less, sell more, should we be thinking about residential mortgages staying flat as a percentage of the total portfolio from here or more from a dollar balance? and then when you look at the overall mortgage market expectation, i guess just maybe comment on the strength of the purchase market and inventory and things like that in your market.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
well, we -- on a dollar sense, the balances should remain relatively flat for the rest half -- for the rest of the year. with regards to the actual volume of purchase stuff, i mean, inventories are low but as the house comes on the market it is sold and the purchase volume actually is increasing as the refinance volume is going down. so it's pretty robust, jared.
jared shaw -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then, marcy, maybe can you just comment on what the expectation is for sort of the pace of ppp fee at this point going forward?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
you bet. and so, we have about $26.5 million in deferred fees at this point with about $1.1 million remaining from the 2020 originations. so that's going to come into income before the end of the year. the balance of it, i would guess between now and the end of the year, 60%. yes, 50% to 60%. i think that's reasonable to expect that to come in, in addition to the normal amortization.
jared shaw -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. and then finally, maybe, kevin, just the -- have you changed any expectations around what the deposit duration could be? i know a lot of people are -- were focusing on the strength of -- the growth and the -- really low cost that everyone has been able to generate on deposits. but what's your expectation for duration as rates start to move? i know you're clearly keeping the asset side really short duration, do you think that we've seen a change in what could be sort of the traditional understanding of deposit duration?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
well -- yes, it's a great question, jared. i wish i had a crystal ball to tell me exactly what's going to happen with deposits. right now our expectation, i would say, is that deposits, we're in a deposit-growing season right now. and so we're expecting those deposits to continue to grow. and i think some of the growth and we looked in it, it's interesting. we grew about 3,100 new deposit relationships during the quarter. and then that -- those new deposit ratios brought us about $110 million. so i don't know. i think deposits are -- from this point are going to continue to grow. i'm not sure exactly when that growth will slow down. but right now, we're in our traditional seasonal deposit growth season.
operator
and our next question today comes from jeff rulis with d.a. davidson.
jeffrey rulis -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
marcy, on your guide of nii to continue to increase in the second half, i guess that sort of begs the question on the two components of that, margin and earning asset balance, is the confidence more on you think you can keep earning asset balances up or growing and margin flat? i just wanted to kind of understand the components of that.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and so if you look at what we expect for loan and deposit growth, we would expect the second quarter, the nim to be near the bottom excluding ppp impacts with only a little bit of run rate impact as a result of the investments we made late in the second quarter. but we do believe we're going to see a nice lift in our net interest income going into the second half of the year. again because earning asset balances are going to be up and that's going to drive net interest income growth.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
all bets are off with regards to net interest margin because if deposits continue to be robust, growth that we're seeing is still going to continue to put pressure on our net interest margin. but net interest income we feel very strong that will increase throughout the rest of the year ex-ppp.
jeffrey rulis -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. okay. so it sounds like more of a confidence on the earning asset balance then margin is going to do what it's going to do but -- ok. fair enough.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
that's correct.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
that's correct.
jeffrey rulis -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. the -- wanted to talk about the -- just the decline in non-performers if there was anything specific to those credits or if those were pandemic related or what was kind of cleaning up in the portfolio there?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
yes. we'll have our chief credit officer answer that question. mike?
michael lugli -- chief credit officer
yes. so this is mike lugli. the decline really was a result of payoffs and a large charge-off of $2.2 million associated with one loan. so that really kind of drove that number down. charge-offs themselves growth were relatively flat and recoveries were -- continue to be very robust and strong.
operator
and our next question today comes from jackie bohlen with kbw.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
i wanted to start with the mountain division because i know the west has been outpacing it and i feel like that's usually our discussion. but wanted -- you sounded more optimistic on the mountain division and then i saw the article you were referencing about billings, so i just wanted to see how you were thinking about growth and what it was last quarter?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
well, first of all, good positive growth is better than what we've seen for a period of time. so the west has been really holding us up, so it's really nice to see real positive growth. and it's kind of -- it's really through -- montana is doing really well. and the interesting thing is bozeman used to be a hot market but it's now spreading throughout missoula and helena and billings and all the different cities. so that growth is not only which we continue to see and always saw growth in, say, the bozeman area, it's now spreading throughout like montana. and even in wyoming we're seeing some growth for the first time. south dakota has been always kind of strong but it's even stronger now. so that's kind of what we're talking about. but we used to see a draw in some markets we're actually contracting, so the growth was harder to offset but it's -- we don't see any real contraction of any of the markets who were all kind of growing.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i think last year, jackie, we talked a lot about how we were exiting credits in the mountain portfolio that we didn't feel were good credits to carry on our balance sheet. and so we just don't have that headwind this year. we feel like we have a pretty clean book. we don't have the headwind of exiting some of those credits that we've exited the last -- actually couple of years in the mountain division.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. so when i think about the interplay of the west and the mountain and just the growth optimism, you obviously had a great quarter for growth, might see stronger growth than you even anticipated later in the year it sounds like, is that more a reflection of favorable trends in the mountain division or is it favorable all across the board meaning the west is growing faster than you would have expected as well?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
i would say favorable across the board.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
and then in terms of the c&i growth outside ppp, that was great to see. is that new customer related or is there something else at play there? you mentioned line utilization was fairly flat.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
new customer related.
jackie bohlen -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and then just one last one and i'll step back. when i think about -- and i know that this is more an existential question. when i think about deposits, and i understand what's going on with strong customers who are bringing deposits into the bank, i guess what in your mind do you think it will take for line utilization to come up from where it's at given the trends that you're seeing with maybe customers are using some of their deposits that they're coming in as quickly as they're using them?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
yes. sometimes you want line utilization and sometimes you don't because some line utilization, they don't -- can't pay it back. but i don't know. i think they're flushed with cash right now, so we're not really anticipating line utilization to pick up too fast. we'd like to see it pick up but i think that the latest customers are flushed with cash. but some of the line utilization, though is in construction lending, so we're going to see some of that increase as we move throughout the rest of the year.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and, jackie, i don't have the exact numbers in front of me but we did look at kind of what our clients' average balances trends were from 2019 into the current environment, and they've gone up substantially. so i agree with what kevin said. it's just that folks have a lot of cash on hand right now and -- so they're not feeling a need to borrow.
operator
and our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
maybe first one just on -- i know it's not that significant, but the $1 million of unusual expenses this quarter what do they relate to and where did that show up in the p&l?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so about half of that amount, matt, was in salaries and wages and then the balance was split evenly between benefits and other expenses.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just on the improvement in criticized loans, i know you -- kevin, you've been working hard at getting those numbers down since you arrived and they've come down more meaningfully this quarter. i guess what changed this quarter, i guess how much of that was upgrades versus moving credits out of the bank and so forth?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
i'm going to have our chief credit officer to again answer that question. go ahead, michael.
michael lugli -- chief credit officer
yes. so you saw in the reduction quarter-over-quarter about $13.8 million was reduction in balances either line utilization coming down or just regular amortization. also in our ag book where you saw a fair amount come down, that was just from the strong year that they had in 2020. it was an exceptional year for those folks. there was about -- of the $37 million, about $6 million was upgrades, and then the balance of around $18 million was payoffs.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. got it. and then just on the reserve continues to migrate lower. i guess, can you give us your updated thoughts on where that ratio could bottom? is day 1 still where you think it will eventually shake out or do you feel like based on the current mix and better macro factors, you could fall below that?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
at this point, just getting back to the day 1 at around 1.2 or maybe a few basis points lower than that, i think that -- i think it will get to that point over the next year or so and then we'll kind of see where it goes from there. a lot could change in the year as we know.
matthew clark -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes. okay. and then any material shift in your m&a conversations in the last -- since we last spoke in the last few weeks?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
i knew i would not get off the phone answering some question around m&a, but we continue to be very selective on what we're going to do. so i mean, there's a lot of banks out there looking for partners but we're going to be picky. and if and when we do announce a transaction, you can rest assured, it will be a good transaction for our shareholders, a good franchise builder and go forward. so we're being patient, which is not normally my forte but i think at this time in the consolidation thing we have to do the right deal in order for us to be a consolidator way out into the future.
operator
and our next question comes from andrew terrell with stephens.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
so i hear you on the residential mortgage expectations, but just trying to maybe ring fence that with some of the deposit commentary, i guess if deposit growth continues coming at just such a strong pace and above expectations, would that potentially increase the appetite into retaining more resi mortgage in the back half of the year or does it make more sense just to put cash to work in securities just so you can better manage the overall kind of duration?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, absolutely the second comment. i think putting it into the investment portfolio where we can manage duration like you just stated, that would be our focus in the second half of the year.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
okay. got it. and then maybe just the in-migration trends across your markets have clearly been awesome as you've noted and picked up over the past year or so, i know that drives kind of home purchases and everything near term, but have you seen those migration trends begin to impact new business formation and commercial loan demand yet or is that something that you think carries kind of a longer tail?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
well, i think we're seeing some right now but i think it's a longer tail. i think it's going to continue to pick up as people believe these are markets that they should invest in because of the economic growth. so that's going to continue to build as the years go by.
andrew terrell -- stephens -- analyst
okay. maybe one last one for me, kevin, since we last spoke multiples kind of across the group have come in a decent amount, can you just remind us how much you currently have outstanding under a buyback authorization, and then any update on the appetite for repurchases?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
i don't know what to...
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
it's about 400,000 shares remaining under -- well, actually $1.9 million. it's $1.9 million under the current authorized buyback, $1.9 million.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
and, andrew, as we always have stated we're really diligent on the earn back of tangible book value dilution, so we're very cautious of when we buy back our stocks so that we don't dilute tangible book and have a long earn back timeline. so we continue to monitor that. when there's a good time to do it we will, and if it's not, we won't. so we -- that's just the principles that we have here.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and i think we feel really good about our organic growth opportunities and potential m&a opportunities. and so we probably choose to use our capital to do that first.
operator
[operator instructions] today's next question comes from tim coffey at janney.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
kevin and marcy, i appreciate your comments on margin and i think you're spot on there. so the -- i guess the next derivative of that question is the growth that we saw in net interest income this quarter, core i think it was around 2.4%. is that repeatable?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
is it low?
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
it could -- just pencil in that area and i think you'll be good.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
right. that's all i understand. i think it was a raw condition to talk about margin when we should be really talking about spread income at this point. and then if you look at your deposits -- deposit accounts that received ppp funds, has there been a material change in those balances in the last year?
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. we've seen our deposit balances increase over the last year. and i don't have the numbers in front of me, but we have seen a pretty substantial increase in deposit balance, the carrying balance in accounts.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
okay. so the ppp money is still sitting there.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so, tim, what i think what happened is that they threw a lot of money into some of our markets. and some of these businesses, they were still operating. they were still making money. they were still paying their employees, but they received excess funds. so i think a lot of it just was excess for them. it wasn't like they really needed the money to survive and they had to utilize those funds to pay their employees, i think a lot of these. we didn't shut down as hard as some of the other markets across the country. so a lot of these employers benefited from it and i think they're just holding on to that excess liquidity.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
well, which is also why we're not seeing line utilization go up. so.
tim coffey -- janney -- analyst
okay. well, then it's really good to see that you put the money to work in the investment portfolio and committed to that. and then just one last thing for me. i think billings is a great town and totally deserving of that recognition. so i'll step back there.
marcy mutch -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, tim.
kevin riley -- president & chief executive officer
it was a bad picture to wall street though. they had wells fargo's picture there instead of us. this is our headquarters.
operator
