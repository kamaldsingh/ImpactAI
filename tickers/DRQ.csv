ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to dril-quip's conference call. [operator instructions] an updated investor deck was posted under the investors tab on the company's website yesterday along with earnings release and will be referenced during today's call. the conference is being recorded, and a replay will be made available on the company's website following the call.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that dril-quip's comments may include forward-looking statements and discuss non-gaap financial measures. it should be noted that a variety of factors could cause dril-quip's actual results to differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the fourth-quarter 2019 financial and operational results announcement we released yesterday for a full disclosure on forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-gaap measures. i would now like to turn the conference over to blake deberry, dril-quip's president and chief executive officer.
please go ahead, sir.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. on behalf of the management team, i would like to welcome all of you to today's year-end conference call. last february, we hosted our initial conference call, and said we believe that hosting these calls annually made the most sense for dril-quip and the investment community. we received positive feedback from that call, along with our plan to do them once per year, and are pleased to have you join us again this year to discuss the strong results we had in 2019.
i will begin with a high-level review of our 2019 results and highlight many accomplishments that we were able to deliver, including a detailed review of our highly successful transformation launched in late 2018. i will then turn the call over to jeff bird, senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer, to review the financial results and give general guidance for 2020. i will then provide some closing comments and open the call to questions. i'm particularly proud of the many achievements we made in an improving, but still uncertain, offshore energy environment over this past year.
our employees and management team continued to provide new products, which deliver permanent cost savings to our customers, transform our operating model to drive efficiencies, execute operationally and generate free cash flow. while we reduce cost and rationalize our global footprint, as part of our transformation, our commitment to our customers remained unchanged, and we continue to provide the highest level of service and support to our expanding customer base. our operational focus and execution led to a $30 million or 8% year-over-year growth in revenue to $415 million. we saw revenue growth throughout 2019, with q1 2019 revenue at $94 million and q4 2019 revenue at $109 million.
more importantly, though, we translated the revenue growth to quarterly adjusted ebitda increases as well. our adjusted ebitda grew by $36 million or 209% year over year to $53.8 million. many of the financial and operational gains we achieved were directly attributable to our ability to deliver on our ambitious sales transformation and cost savings initiatives. as we previously announced, in 2018, we began implementation of a full business transformation centered around a structured approach to sales and cost performance.
we see the results of these efforts in our 2019 operating performance. our retooled commercial teams delivered increases in product bookings, created an organization to specifically target new customers and expand sales of new products and solutions to our existing client base. the changes we made were systemic, and are now part of our dna moving forward. we initially announced a target of $40 million to $50 million of total annualized cost savings from our companywide initiatives to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies.
i'm very pleased that through the efforts of our global workforce, we were able to deliver annualized savings of $52 million, above the high end of our expectations. we maintained a footprint in key markets, while leveraging an integrated supply chain model, which will create more flexibility in addressing our customers' needs. the sustainable cost savings initiatives we accomplished are optimizing and improving our infrastructure across manufacturing, supply chain, sg&a, engineering and r&d and have certainly contributed to the strong growth in adjusted ebitda we generated in 2019. as we look to 2020 and beyond, we will focus on productivity improvements and further leveraging our supply chain and procurement capability.
the fourth quarter saw revenue continued to increase to $109 million and adjusted ebitda grow to nearly $16 million. in addition to strong revenue and adjusted ebitda growth, we were also able to sustainably grow our product bookings. the fourth quarter of 2019 was the first time in 22 quarters that we achieved non-project product bookings above $100 million. for the full year of 2019, we saw our product bookings increase year over year by $144 million or 59% to $388 million.
our innovative and award-winning r&d remains a key component to the future growth and continued commercial excellence. new technology product bookings grew in 2019 to approximately 13% of total product bookings or $51 million, more than tripling the $15 million we achieved in 2018. in 2019, we received orders for our new bigbore iie wellhead system, specifying the dxe profile as well as for high-strength, high-fatigue badger connectors. we also received another spotlight on new technology award from otc for the xpak de liner system, which is the industry's first double expansion system and is particularly well suited for large diameter casing strings used when drilling wells in deepwater.
in october 2018, we entered into a front-end engineering and design or feed contract and frame agreement with premier oil exploration and production limited, in relation to the subsea production systems for the sea lion phase i development located offshore the falkland islands. this project has continued to move forward toward project sanction, and we continue to work with premier on post-feed clarification and project development to conclude fully termed contract agreements for project execution. we are encouraged that this project continues to move forward. as we announced last year, in february of 2019, our board authorized an additional $100 million share repurchase program.
this was in addition to the $100 million share repurchase program that we completed in 2018. in 2019, we repurchased over 615,000 common shares for a total of $26.6 million under the current program. as you can see, we still have over $70 million of available remaining to opportunistically buy back more shares. with a debt-free balance sheet, and $399 million in cash at year-end 2019, we have significant dry powder for future repurchases as well as investing in possible funding needed for key projects, supporting an upturn and pursuing strategic acquisitions.
as you can see, we worked hard in 2019, executing on our business and sales transformations, and remain focused on achieving our strategic goals, while operating efficiently and generating free cash flow through this downturn. with that, i will turn the call over to jeff to review the financials and provide more details on our cost-cutting initiatives. 
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
thank you, blake, and good morning, everyone. our financial results for the fourth quarter showed continued improvement. revenue for the fourth quarter increased from the prior quarter to $109 million. this was at the high end of our guidance range of $100 million to $110 million, and was primarily driven by increased service and leasing activity.
for the full-year 2019, our revenues were $415 million, an increase versus 2018 of about 8%. on a segment basis, our western hemisphere revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 continued to increase from the prior quarter by $5 million or 8%, primarily driven by increases in subsea wellheads and trees as well as aftermarket revenue in the gulf of mexico and parts of latin america. our eastern hemisphere revenue decreased by approximately $4 million or 14% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter due to timing of product sales. asia pacific revenue was flat sequentially.
we continue to see that our cost initiatives translated to stronger overall operating margins. for the full-year 2019, gross operating margin was 29%, which was up from the 24% we realized in 2018. as a reminder, revenue increased over $30 million, yet cost of sales only increased $1.4 million. this is despite a negative mix impact from higher fabricated joint revenue mostly seen in the second half of 2019.
moving to sg&a expenses. for the fourth quarter of 2019, sg&a was $21 million, a reduction of $6.5 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to a onetime year-end adjustment to stock compensation expense. for the full-year 2019, sg&a expenses decreased to $97 million from $101 million in 2018. we captured meaningful savings in 2019 and brought our organization in line with anticipated future needs.
these gains were partially offset by salary inflation as we return to a more normalized merit cycle. despite these headwinds, sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 23% for 2019, down from 26% for 2018. as we move into 2020, we would expect sg&a expenses to average approximately $25 million a quarter. as blake discussed, we have delivered transformational cost savings that helped us expand our ability to generate adjusted ebitda in 2019.
and we expect the full impact of many of these savings will be seen in 2020. if you look at the presentation we posted to the website, on slide 10, you'll see that we ambitiously set our savings goal at $40 million to $50 million, and we were able to exceed that goal by methodically executing our transformation initiative, while optimizing our operating capability. we delivered $52 million in annualized savings, and we break that out by area where we'll be able to capture those savings. we are continuing to transform the way we do business with a view toward leveraging operating costs, while ensuring we meet and exceed customer expectations.
early in 2019, we began our lean journey. this journey has touched every location and every function within our business. this past year, 230 employees participated in 70 events across our four major manufacturing locations. and we are on pace to double that amount in 2020.
probably the most important element of this transformation is our daily gemba walks. each day at every one of our manufacturing facilities, cross-functional teams walk the shop floor, reviewing performance from the prior day. this allows us to quickly understand and react to problems in real time. earlier, i used the word journey.
this was intentional. the tools our employees learned and embraced in 2019 will continue to reap benefits in 2020 and beyond. we expect to see additional gains in productivity across all aspects of our business as they continue to apply the tools learned in 2019. to be clear, we realized approximately $30 million of savings in 2019, and expect the balance of the $52 million to be realized in 2020.
in addition, we are targeting 8% to 10% gross productivity improvement that will benefit 2021. looking ahead to 2020, the recent coronavirus outbreak has resulted in supply disruptions, weakening commodity prices and causing uncertainty for global demand for oil and gas. we are proactively taking steps to minimize our supply disruptions. the newly built out supply chain organization and operating model allow us to shift production to our facilities in aberdeen, houston and macae.
this will help mitigate any disruption to our singapore facility, but more importantly, allow our employees to focus on more urgent personal needs. looking at net income. for the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported net income of $7.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share. adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $8.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share.
as shown on slide 21, in the fourth quarter of 2019, our capex totaled $3 million and for the full year, it was $12 million. we estimate our normal annual maintenance capex to run between $10 million and $15 million per year. however, as a result of the rapid acceptance of our new products, we will invest $5 million to $10 million in new running tools in 2020. this would bring our full-year capex guidance to $15 million to $25 million in 2020.
we will continue to monitor global demand and adjust our capital expenditures accordingly. free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $5 million and the full-year 2019 was $3 million, despite strategically investing in subsea tree and downhole tools inventory. as blake noted, free cash flow is a key priority of ours, and we remain focused on generating positive free cash flow. this is the seventh consecutive year of positive free cash flow.
through a combination of our new operating model and focused efforts of our lean tools, we are targeting reductions in overall working capital between now and mid-2021. if you look at slide 13 in the presentation, you will see that we are targeting a 45- to 60-day reduction in our cash-to-cash cycle across all elements of working capital. for 2020, we have redesigned our compensation metrics to include working capital turns as a key objective. at year end, we had cash on hand of $399 million, and $33 million available in our abl facility, resulting in approximately $432 million of available liquidity.
we remain committed to investing for the long term, returning cash to shareholders and pursuing strategic acquisitions. we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the future and remain focused on continuing to optimize our operating model and allocate capital efficiently. with that said, i will turn the call back over to blake.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. as we look to 2020 and beyond, we remain cautiously optimistic about the offshore energy recovery, despite the recent decline in oil pricing and downward pressure on global demand due to the coronavirus. our proactive approach in 2019 to focus on our bottoms-up strategic plan with a vision toward the long-term viability of dril-quip has made us a stronger company with the flexibility to adapt to changing markets. while we experienced some supply delays due to the coronavirus, we are able to ramp up our production in facilities outside of the asia pacific region to meet our customers' demands.
this near-term disruption has us forecasting revenue for the first quarter of 2020 to be between $95 million and $105 million. prior to this, we were expecting to provide a more favorable guidance in the range of $110 million to $115 million. despite these uncertainties, i am encouraged that our product bookings estimate for the first quarter remains between $85 million and $105 million. we spent the past 18 months reevaluating our overall business and product lines, and believe that we realigned and reorganized our entire company to operate more efficiently in any macro environment.
we will no longer manufacture everything in every location, but instead, we will find the cost-effective manufacturing solutions that leverage our newly created supply chain capability and ensure our customers get quality products, while maximizing the returns for the company. we will continue to make strides in fine-tuning our supply chain to ensure that we capture long-term sustainable improvements. we have an experienced results-driven organization, delivering first-class service and a strong, clean balance sheet with nearly $400 million in cash on hand. we will continue to focus on r&d and leverage our technologically innovative products to grow revenue and product bookings.
most recently, we are getting interest from both independents and majors regarding our impressive new product pipeline. as a result, we expect to spend an incremental $8 million to $10 million on research and development in 2020 to accelerate product development and future growth and revenue for these new products. therefore, we estimate quarterly engineering expense to now average around $7 million. finally, we will build on our long history of generating free cash flow and delivering profitable growth, which should meaningfully add value to our shareholders.
with that, i will turn the call over to the operator to open the line up for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from david anderson of barclays. please go ahead.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. good morning, blake. so a question on brazil. in your presentation, you had highlighted, brazil as one of the main growth areas through 2023.
it seems to be one of the few offshore markets that's actually starting to move right now. so i guess, two questions there. one, can you remind us where you stand now, kind of contracts for wellheads with your customers? i think there was a big carryover from some of these contracts from last cycle. so i'm just kind of curious, is there any left on those contracts? or do they need to be renewed? and then secondarily, can you give us a status on your inventory on the ground at macae? maybe i missed it, but i think you said something about taking some of those wells from macae to supply other parts.
and as i recall, there's a lot of inventory on the ground. i think it was already paid for, but never installed. can you just kind of refresh our memory here on where we stand on that?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. thanks, david. so on your first question with respect to existing contracts, primarily with petrobras in brazil, that contract did expire, petrobras. if you remember, we renegotiated the contract.
petrobras had an obligation to acquire a minimum, place purchase orders for a minimum amount of products for the extended period, they have fulfilled that requirement. and so that contract, although we may still supply some items under, i don't expect that we'll get any new orders under that contract specifically. secondly, with respect to inventory, your recollection is pretty good. i think it was about two years ago, we were down in macae.
and at that point, petrobras commented to us that they had 300 wellhead systems in inventory at that time. they have been burning through that inventory. it's actually been quite positive for us. we've worked hard to try and make dril-quip the preferred provider in there.
i think, currently, five out of every six wells that petrobras drills uses a dril-quip wellhead. so the good news is they're consuming our wellheads at a faster pace. and we are hearing indications that petrobras is going to come out for a tender for about 70 wellhead systems sometime in 2020. so we're looking forward to them resuming a more normal purchase and consumption operation.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. that was actually my next question, if any tenders are on the horizon. so that's great to hear. second, kind of a different subject altogether.
on the subsea tree side, can you just tell us how much of the kind of 2019 orders came from trees? but just kind of a little bit bigger picture here, subsea tree market looks probably flat again for 2020. is it fair to say kind of any material orders for you guys is unlikely? i would think the big three guys out there are pretty aggressive. it's not typically a game you guys like to play. so is it fair to say that probably '21 is probably a better time frame for some of these orders on the tree side?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
actually, no. so 2019, we had a pretty successful year. we booked nine subsea trees in 2019. so we were pleased with that result.
and for 2020, we're actually internally expecting a little bit better bookings. should the macro environment hold, we're expecting a little bit better bookings than 9. so we're pretty positive about that. that's one of the reasons that we've guided up our r&d.
we've spent a lot of time on the subsea tree space, trying to get a differentiated product. i believe we have one. we've sold the first one of those. we call that vxte.
so you can watch this space at otc. we're going to unveil that product at otc this year. and that product has gotten a lot of interest, both from independents, but more importantly, for major operators because it does provide a significant differentiation that can save them some money during the installation. and we have sold the first of those products, and we expect to deliver that in the third quarter and hopefully get that installed in the fourth quarter of 2020.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
that's great, blake. so i've been covering you guys for 15 years now, and this is the first time i've ever asked a question on one of your calls. so i'm asking a third question. i think i've waited long enough.
so i'm just curious on the supply chain. you talked about that a couple of times. can you just give us an update on your forging operations? it's now being run by afglobal. is that transition complete? how has it gone? kind of what's your, i guess, thoughts and kind of where we stand right now?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
sure. actually, it's very positive. so the transition is complete. afglobal is fully operational in that forge facility.
we do have a supply contract from them. our supply chain people interact with afglobal probably almost daily looking at forward demand. they're setting up a stocking program for us. so we believe the lease arrangement of that forge facility at afglobal is beneficial to both companies.
and quite honestly, jeff and i meet with the leaders at afglobal on a regular basis just to do a health check to make sure things are going well because our view is, this arrangement is beneficial to both companies.
david anderson -- barclays -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question will come from sean meakim of jp morgan. please go ahead.
sean meakim -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you. hey. good morning. so maybe to start off.
can you just help us think about how the lower expectations for 1q revenue flow into the rest of the year? in other words, is there a catch-up opportunity? or does the rest just get pushed to the right in terms of the cadence? and is there a margin impact from the shift away from singapore in the near term?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
jeff, do you want to take that?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yes. so what we're experiencing in q1 candidly is just a temporary disruption. and candidly, that's just a result of an extended lunar new year and a number of our workers in singapore go back to china for that new year. and as they came back in, we essentially lost about three weeks worth of production, and then kind of a slow ramp from there.
we are setting up operations in houston to mitigate any future risks there. there will be really an immaterial impact from a margin standpoint. it will primarily be, as we're setting that up in q1, q2, less than $1 million, i would imagine. and right now, we view this as very temporary.
we'll be up and running in houston by the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter, and we're fully operational in singapore now again.
sean meakim -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you. and then i was just thinking, a lot of the heavy lifting on self-help last year.
in our recent discussions, you talked about m&a being potentially back on the table. you bought back a decent amount of stock in the fourth quarter. your long-term business view hasn't changed. that made your stock a lot cheaper, as we've seen the move in the rest of the market.
maybe if i could just get your latest thoughts on uses of cash beyond organic capex and how that's evolving, considering what's happening with your stock versus maybe what sellers are expecting out there in the m&a space?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so first off, through 2019, we were intently focused on the cost-out program. i mean, we did not spend a lot of energies on anything other than let's execute on the cost out. and quite honestly, that shows in the results that we had.
we exceeded the top end of our target. as we roll into 2020, we're stepping back and we're doing just a bottoms-up strategic review again based on what's the market doing. what are our new capabilities? and quite honestly, as jeff and i have said before, through this self-help program, we basically integrated ourselves. and in so doing, developed a lot more skills within our management team that changes how we view acquisitions going forward.
so we're going to hit the pause button here and do that strategic review and see where that takes us as we go forward. share repurchase will probably always be in the mix. that is our preferred method to return cash to the shareholders due to the cyclical nature of our business. but we want to do that strategic review first and have a more broader look at what the market is offering before we make the call.
sean meakim -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sean.
operator
our next question will come from marc bianchi with simmons, pardon me, with cowen. please go ahead.
marc bianchi -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask on the order outlook. you guys tempered the revenue outlook for obvious operational reasons. i'm curious, if we didn't have this virus concern and kind of the concern on the oil price, would your order outlook look any different? and blake, i know it's early days here with the impact of the virus.
can you kind of talk to any customer conversations you've had and how customers might be thinking about what to do from here?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, mark. look, as we said in the call, we were prepared to forecast a q1 revenue kind of in the $110 million to $115 million range. we were entering 2020 very optimistic.
we've done the heavy lifting. our sales transformation and execution is paying dividends and still is. we did not change our bookings forecast for the quarter. we're having conversations with our customer.
most of our customers are still in the wait-and-see mode. most believe this is transitory. it's going to come and go. and particularly in the offshore space, unlike the shorter cycle business, our customer views are much longer term and from plan to development and first oil, it's just a broader time period.
so i'm hoping that we don't really see any change in our bookings profile as the year progresses.
marc bianchi -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that's encouraging. on the margin side for first quarter. jeff, you mentioned the $1 million related to this repositioning of throughput.
just the other factor, i think, that's going on or maybe there's a couple of factors. you had the higher fab joint mix in the second half of '19, so it sounds like maybe that could be a tailwind to margins as that rolls to a lower share going into '20. but i'm also wondering if new products are also a tailwind. could you kind of talk about how that progresses here into the first quarter and beyond? and maybe quantify, to the extent you can, how much that could help?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yes. so on the fab joints, we would see that high level of fab joints really continue into the first quarter of 2020. and then as we get near the end of the year, we'll start to see that go back to a more normalized level, but that will only probably happen in the back half of the year. and from a quantify standpoint, given we're not giving full-year guidance right now, probably not going to comment on an exact number there.
and then the other spot on margins, the $1 million you mentioned in the first quarter. it will probably be below that $1 million in the first quarter, but that will be transitory in the first quarter.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, marc, this is blake jumping here. i would say that the product mix to more fab joints, we actually view as encouraging because the dynamic that's happening there is that our customers are consuming wellheads that they have in inventory, buying the tubular products to go with that. and so that means that inventory is drawing down and indicating a likely increase in demand for the wellhead products, which will improve the mix.
marc bianchi -- cowen and company -- analyst
right. right. ok. guys, thanks for that.
i'll turn it back.
operator
and our next question will come from ian macpherson with simmons. please go ahead.
ian macpherson -- simmons energy -- analyst
thanks. good morning, blake and jeff. i also just wanted  sorry to flog the horse here on margins. so there is a lot that's moving.
and jeff, you still have $20-plus million of annualized benefits to capture this year. but i'm struggling to bridge from q4 to q1, given there will be some decremental with the revenue decline. and then you've got g&a and your engineering and product development expenditures higher as well. so in my mind, i am seeing $5 million to $10 million of ebitda decrement from q4 into q1.
is that too extreme or not?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
that's too extreme. and we're talking about it on an adjusted ebitda basis. so let me just talk about the different elements there. if i look at it on the margin side, a little bit of headwind as we reposition the manufacturing from singapore to houston.
that's $1 million which we spoke about. on the sg&a side, because of the onetime nature of the stock comp charge, that makes that number look artificially low in the fourth quarter. but if you think about the $25 million that we guided on sg&a, that's really in line with exactly what we did on a full-year 2019. so that's $25 million a quarter.
and that's in spite of the fact that we're returning to a more normal merit cycle. and then when you get to r&d or engineering, you're right to say there will be some headwinds there. on the engineering side, we said we're going to invest $8 million to $10 million in incremental r&d projects this year. that will ramp up throughout the year.
probably starting on the low side in q1 and then ramping up to a full number by the fourth quarter. so if you think about that as, call it, $2 million to $2.5 million a quarter, it will start on that low side in q1 and probably wouldn't be at the full $2.5 million run rate until the fourth quarter.
ian macpherson -- simmons energy -- analyst
perfect. that's super helpful. on the working capital side, you've already made a lot of improvement over the past couple of years in your inventory turns coming down from, i guess, preternaturally high levels, so closer to the normal levels for your business now, but still some more ways to go there. but then on the receivables, that's been moving away from you recently.
can you just talk about what you think are the easier and harder objectives within working capital this year that you're going after?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at the presentation that we posted on slide 13, we walked through kind of the cash-to-cash improvement that we expect over the next year and half. if i look at the easy things, the easy things, candidly, are probably going to be the bottom two, which is inventory reduction and improved vendor payments. we did invest a little bit in inventory in 2019, and we'll invest a little bit more in 2020, but not much more.
there's a lot of opportunity there, though, as we get ourselves set up and we burn through some of the excess inventory in those cells to move from a model where we might have been speculatively buying product, we're not buying this close to actual production time. so that's what we're working on there. and that 20 to 25 days, a reduction that you see there. the vendor payment terms actually is a side benefit of the supply chain work that we did in 2019.
so we did a lot of good work in 2019 to drive cost down there. but at the same time we were doing that work to drive cost down, we're also being more aggressive around vendor terms. so you did see an improvement from 2018 to 2019 in dpo. we believe we can expand that even further over the next 12 to 18 months.
the tougher part, because it's not within our control, is the vendor milestone payments. and candidly, we get a lot of questions around price as it relates to our customers. what we don't get a lot of questions around are payment terms. and candidly, just as payment, as price was pushed during the downturn, payment terms were also pushed during the downturn as well.
so what we're looking at this year is the first step back, if you think about a pricing environment. one of the first step back in gaining price is really starting to gain more reasonable terms. so we're going to be working a lot with that on our customers this year just from a milestone payment. blake mentioned the nine trees, being more aggressive around milestone payments around those trees.
but then there's also an opportunity with a number of our customers to really work hand-in-hand with them on with some of our lean tools and reducing that billing cycle and the number of errors we see between ourselves and our customers. it's actually a couple of customers that we've actually had joint kaizens with while we're working on those type of projects. so hopefully that's helpful.
ian macpherson -- simmons energy -- analyst
very helpful, go forth and conquer. thanks for the answers today.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
thank you, ian.
operator
and our next question will come from george o'leary with tudor, pickering, holt & co. please go ahead.
george o'leary -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
morning, guys. the increased spend on r&d makes a lot of sense to me as you guys have always been innovators and always very focused on the technology side of the equation. i wonder if you could share a little bit about kind of where that r&d spend, that incremental r&d spend year over year is directed and what types of problems your customers are looking for you to solve? just any incremental color on where you guys are focused on deploying that incremental r&d spend would be super interesting.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
certainly. so first off, let's just say, we've invested in r&d throughout the downturn. that's one of the benefits of having the balance sheet that we have and the free cash flow. and our focus really has been on developing products that structurally change the way our customers drill wells, to provide them permanent cost savings going forward.
so what you're really talking about there is giving them time, right? you're giving them back time, you're reducing installation time, which is incredibly meaningful to them. it helps on both the irr space. and quite honestly, it helps their esg, right? if i spend less days offshore, i got a smaller carbon footprint. so looking at 2019, i talked about the new vxte product and really our tree products in general.
we've got a lot of traction in that sps space. and as we looked at that, one of the things that we evaluated is the whole package of trees, which includes subsea controls. we do have a subsea controls business. and we haven't been funding r&d in that subsea controls space as much as we have the hardware products.
and so the bulk of this r&d is really focused on our subsea controls product line and business to update that controls, modernize it and also make it a much more flexible product going forward. and we believe that's going to help us in the entire sps space, right, selling trees and controls in an integrated package.
george o'leary -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
very interesting. i appreciate that color, blake. and then you guys mentioned on the call, you're kind of looking at your manufacturing footprint and moving to a model where you don't make everything everywhere. i wondered if you could provide some examples of some products that once upon a time you were making at a certain facility, and now you'll only be making them at one or two facilities and kind of how that translates into cost savings for you guys as i just thought that was an interesting comment.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
i might hand that one to jeff. this is his bailiwick.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
so if we look at our facilities, we've really set it up as centers of excellence. so if you step back and you went back to 2018, virtually every facility made product for their region, and that made them inefficient, different products going over different machines, a little bit more complicated, not able to rearrange the shop floor in a way that's most efficient for specific products. so we started '19 really looking at a center of excellence, and these are the large products, obviously, as center of excellence for wellheads in houston. and we rearranged, candidly rearranged machines so that the machines were closer together to make producing just wellheads in houston much simpler.
so the example we often give is, pre this rearrangement, a wellhead would have traveled two and a half miles in our houston facility beginning to end. and now, it's literally a matter of feet that it travels beginning to end. and so you can imagine the opportunity there, forklifts and inventory and expeditors and all the things that happen there. so that's houston.
we manufacture our connectors, largely all our connectors now in singapore. and those cells are up and running, and we're continuing to optimize those cells, and we'll expect some more savings from those in the future as well. and then we manufacture our subsea trees in aberdeen. now that cell is not quite up and running yet because we had to make some capital investment there.
that should be up and running by the middle of this year. so we should see benefit as that comes up and running. there will be benefit, obviously, in aberdeen, but there'll be knock-on benefit because some of the other regions that are helping them produce those trees right now are running less efficient than they will post when that coe is up and running. so hopefully, that's helpful.
george o'leary -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
yes. very helpful. thanks for that color.
operator
and our next question will come from connor lynagh of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thanks. morning. i was wondering if we could expand a little more on the incremental engineering expense.
i mean, how would you think about growing your addressable market or what incremental revenue could look like from some of these things you're investing in? just any way to think of the return on that investment?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so if you take a subsea tree, the controls portion of that is going to add about additional $1.5 million to $2 million per tree. so that's the price, right? so as you grow your sps business, you're basically going to add $1.5 million to $2 million per tree in the controls side that's additive to the sales price of the tree.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
and then i think the other knock-on effect is that's the controls piece. but then as you have a world-class tree and you have the controls built out as well and you look at the fact that we booked nine trees in 2019, and you look at a market that's essentially 300-plus trees awarded every year, there's an opportunity really for us to drive share gain there as well. so that's really the win is, a, get more every time you sell a tree, but also the opportunity to drive share in the tree market as well.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. i mean do you guys have any higher level targets for, if we're in a relatively flat market, just for the sake of argument, how much would you expect market share, innovation, etc. to drive growth relative to that market, might frame that up?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
so right now, our market share is relatively low in trees, sub-5%. and so there's just a lot of runway there. and the other challenge that we've had is the breadth of the subsea tree products. we couldn't fulfill all the different varieties that our customer needs.
so what we've first seen is we've expanded our available market. so of the 300 to 350 trees a year, maybe we had 15% of them was our available market. we're moving that up now to the 20%, 30%, 40% of the available market. and that's just giving us more to bid on.
there are still some areas that are always challenging because of local content. so there are some areas that we won't participate in. but we believe with our new products, we definitely have a differentiated product that's attractive to our customers. right now, we have four major operators reviewing our vxte design as we make the first one, so that they can quickly qualify it and get it accepted, giving us an opportunity to bid.
and that's something that we haven't had in the past, right? we've been really good with the independents, but getting a major operator interested in dril-quip's subsea production systems has been elusive. and like i said, we got four of them interested at the present moment.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. just to sneak one more in here and just the broader market, more on the wellhead side of things. i think you guys have talked about for the past couple of years, there's been a bit of a catch-up ordering effect, sort of a restocking.
would you say that's played out at this point? or is there a little more to go? and i appreciate the uncertainty on the oil price puts an...
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i mean so let's set the oil price aside. i think every customer has a little bit different inventory position. i think it is winding, most of them are winding down. we're getting feedback even from the independents, hey, it's time to reorder.
and these are people that have been dormant for three or four years in the offshore arena that are picking back up and consuming inventory they've had. and so our view going forward is we're more back to a more normal order consumption portion in the cycle.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.
operator
and our next question will come from vebs vaishnav of scotiabank. please go ahead.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning and thank you. so typically, you get about 40% of any product bookings in brazil? any reason why that should not hold the same for that 70-wellhead tender you spoke about in brazil coming up this year?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
so brazil is interesting. they're changing their model a bit. and so they're going to a more shorter cycle, shorter quantity, but broader tender based. so i think the model of the past is waning, vebs.
i think it's a competitive bid process. and a lot of it, i think, is because they're partnering with so many iocs that it's changed their bidding model. i will say that our relationship with petrobras is very, very good. we've done a lot of work to allow them to consume their existing inventory, even though they've changed their own technical specifications.
we've done some additional qualification, made some new products, and that's what's allowed them to or driven them to use more of our wellheads on a per well basis. so we're optimistic about the tender, but yes, there's going to be an open tender process, not necessarily a split arrangement as they've done in the past.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
got it. ok. if we have seen increased product bookings, has the mix shifted any one way or the other? if you can talk about that.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
you mean in our backlog, within our backlog?
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
within new orders and backlog, yes.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so yes, in 2019, we have seen a little bit higher percentage booking on the subsea wellheads, which gives us confidence that as we roll into 2020. as jeff spoke earlier, we're going to shift more to the normal mix.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
got it. and maybe a question for jeff. so if i'm thinking about this correctly, you're talking about $100 million sg&a and maybe $8 million to $10 million of higher r&d? that is despite $40 million to $50 million of cost savings that you guys had. can you help me bridge the gap between the two?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
so the $100 million sg&a and the $28 million r&d, the sg&a is flat year on year, the r&d is up. that $40 million to $50 million of cost savings comes across all lines, not just those lines. and the vast majority of that actually comes more on the manufacturing and supply chain side.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
got it.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
versus the sg&a and engineering. there were some very early wins on sg&a and engineering, vebs, but those really happened in late '18, early '19. so the full-year savings from those would have been booked in late '18 and you add that full-year savings there. so you're not going to see incremental savings, not much incremental savings in sg&a and r&d from '19 to '20.
most of that remaining $20 million that needs to come out is going to be in manufacturing and supply chain.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
and is the implication that, yes, in the first quarter, the margins would have some headwinds because of the shift in due to coronavirus, but beyond that, margins should get back to where we saw second half '19 or maybe better?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think the profile that you'd see is there will be a little bit of headwinds on margins because of that. and then, look, just the lower volume, obviously, puts a little bit of pressure on margins as well. but candidly, as you go back to the back end of the year and you start to see the $20 million roll through, that should improve the margins as well through the back half of the year.
so you'll probably start with a little bit of margin headwind in q1 and ramping up through q4.
vebs vaishnav -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you for taking my call.
operator
we have time for one more question, and that will come from blake gendron of wolfe research. please go ahead.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. you mentioned m&a as a use of cash. you've typically done smaller tuck-in deals.
i'm just wondering in light of the r&d comments and wanting to make your sps offering a little bit more marketable here, if you could potentially go for something a little bit larger, maybe on the controls side? or just given your r&d budget is going to be larger this year if you're going to just go at it organically? i'm just trying to understand what the opportunity set is out there for the sps?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yes. so thanks for the question. so the way that we look at it is we have a very clear sps road map that does include controls. we are always evaluating if it's faster and easier to get there inorganically versus organically, but we're not going to sit around and wait for the perfect inorganic opportunity to come along.
it's got to be the right price and the right value. and if it's not the right price and the right value, candidly, we've demonstrated that we can develop r&d. and we've done that with the otc spotlight awards that you've seen over the last two or three years, and we would expect to have the same success on the controls side. if you talk about larger acquisitions, as blake mentioned earlier, we've largely got the transformation piece behind us now.
we're doing another kind of 18 months later and other bottoms-up strategic plan. and i fully expect what will come out of that is a capital allocation strategy that talks a little bit more around what size m&a projects we'd look at in the future.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
got you. that's totally fair. so that's all to say that this framework, as it currently stands, doesn't preclude any larger deals? or would you like to keep it kind of small?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
no, it does not preclude larger deals. i think as we look at where we are in the cycle right now and what's going on in our industry, i think everything is on the table as it relates to acquisitions.
operator
i would now like to turn the conference back over to blake deberry for any closing remarks.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
just in closing, i am extremely proud of our organization, our efforts on the cost out, exceeding performance, our sales organization for incredible bookings year. we look forward to 2020, and we look forward to catching up with you as the year progresses. thanks for attending the call.

and now, i'll turn the microphone over to james west.
james west -- energy analyst
thanks, emily. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our exclusive fireside chat with the executive team for dril-quip. the company reported its first-quarter results last night, and we're of course, excited to have the team with us today. dril-quip also released a supplemental slide deck, which we're not going to go through today, but i suggest everyone to take a look at.
joining me is president and ceo, blake deberry; and senior vice president of production operations and cfo jeff bird. blake joined dril-quip in 1988 and has held a number of management and engineering positions with the company in both domestic and international locations. this includes serving as senior vice president, sales and engineering and as vice president for dril-quip's asia pacific region. he was named ceo in october of 2011.
jeff joined dril-quip as vice president and cfo in 2017. he was promoted to senior vice president of production operations and cfo in 2019 -- sorry, joined in '17. prior to dril-quip, jeff was the cfo of frank's international from 2014 to 2017, cfo of ascend performance materials in 2010 to 2014, and prior to ascend, jeff served in a variety of accounting and finance roles in the industrial manufacturing sector including as a division cfo at danaher. since blake and jeff teamed up, dril-quip has undergone a significant organizational shift with footprint reductions, the introduction of lean manufacturing practices, the integration of supply chain and major cost reductions.
and as outlined in april, additional measures were released last night to react to the impact of the covid-19 crisis and the oil price collapse. one thing i know blake and jeff are really excited about today, is sitting on $343 million in cash and no debt as we go into this downturn. so welcome, gentlemen, and thanks for joining me today. 
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, james. glad to be here.
james west -- energy analyst
so, i don't want to spend too much time looking backwards here. but since you guys typically don't host an earnings call with the 1q release, maybe, we'll start here for just a minute. so, you posted first-quarter results last night that did highlight to myself and i think others, the way that covid-19 impacts have had a negative impact on all areas of global operations and probably will have a much bigger impact in the second quarter. could you highlight some of the challenges brought on by the pandemic and how you're addressing those?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. first off, our top priority has been the safety of our employees around the world as the pandemic has spread. and i have to say that i'm incredibly proud of our employees and their resilience during these rapid changes. our it group, kind of mid-march, went from managing 700 people in our facilities, their it services, to getting them working from home.
and that went off without a hitch, so they -- kudos to them. but i'm most proud of, quite frankly, of what we consider our essential employees and those are people that have to come into the plants and work. they've done an incredible job in both the manufacturing organization and our aftermarket organization and our offshore service technicians. they've still been traveling around the world.
so they've done a great job. but it was disruptive, that's for sure. if you just look at our facilities, it all started around the lunar new year period when some of our machinist went back to china for their native country, and then, couldn't get back, that disrupted our singapore facilities. we had about a one-month disruption there.
and about the time that finished, the u.s. and the u.k. both start going on work at home and lockdowns. we put our business continuity plans.
and by that, what we mean is we separated into two or three shifts, depending on the number of people. we didn't have any overlap of personnel. we had staggered lunch and tea breaks. we also vested all of our employees in their ptos, so their vacation or annual leave.
and we told them if they had special circumstances that they couldn't come in and work or they just felt it was too risky, that they could use that time and take that time. and so, all those things had an impact on our production hours. we got up and running in there. and then shortly after that, the brazilian government shut us down and we were closed for about a week and we worked with petrobras, petrobras petitioned the government.
we got back up and running in brazil. and then, the borders closed between malaysia and singapore, and we have a significant number of malaysian employees. and so, we're scrambling to -- what are we going to do there. and then, singapore hit the circuit breaker because their covid cases came up and we had to petition the government for singapore to stay open and we were successful there.
so that operation continued. and then, singapore continued to get increased cases and they put tighter restrictions on, they actually came in and said, hey, you have 102 direct labor employees who are working. your new number is now 80, right? and so, there's just been -- it's been an incredibly fluid changing environment for our facilities, but we've been managing through that. but all that impacted in our q1 results.
we also had some supply chain disruptions as simply getting materials, but the logistics actually became the more difficult thing, moving materials from place to place. sea freight became challenging, airfreight became almost impossible. so all of those things impacted us. and then, our results were also impacted on the ar side.
as we move to work from home and our customers move to work from home, we had about $10 million in receivables that we expected to get, and that had a negative impact on our cash flow.
james west -- energy analyst
sure. fair enough. and you also, blake or jeff, you took a $40 million in restructuring and impairment charges during the first quarter. could you talk about what the major buckets are related to these charges and impairments?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff, do you want to take that question?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so really three large buckets, if you will. as a result, we talked about this in the press release. as a result of some strategic repositioning on some of our product lines, we're taking an inventory and fixed asset charge of about $24 million.
and that's really starting to think differently about our footprint. severance-related would be about $8 million. and goodwill, and that's the goodwill from tiw, is another $8 million. so all of that relates to our view of the current outlook in the market and really our need to respond appropriately in the market that we're in today.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. that makes sense. so what's -- what are the main drivers here of your downturn playbook? clearly, there's some facility consolidation, disciplined spending, rightsizing the organization. but could you dig deeper into what you're doing with respect to some of those actions?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll be a little sensitive, as you can appreciate, james, in my response here because we want to make sure that we're notifying our employees in locations in an appropriate manner. and obviously, that's going to roll out over the next month or two. so bear with me here if i'm a little vague maybe about locations.
but when we went 1.0 transformation, if you will, we kind of had -- we left that with a playbook that said, hey, if things go down, here's the levers that we know we'll need to pull. so candidly, we had those playbooks in the drawer. but at the time, we thought things were bouncing back. and so, we didn't think we need to execute those.
so a lot of these were already in queue, and just an example, on the product side, we were looking at just a number of product offerings we have. so if you think about our subsea wellheads, today, we have 15 different subsea wellheads. we imagine we can get that down to four or five subsea wellheads. so you can imagine the cost, the inventory, and the footprint shrinkage that you can do just from something like that and how that can help take cost out of the business by having a more common manufacturing process.
so that's just one example of one of the things that we're pulling out of the playbook now and starting to execute on.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. all right. fair enough. despite the crash we've had, really, probably a good way to describe it, in oil prices, bookings for the quarter held up pretty well, about $60 million and the backlog is still kind of near recent highs.
i guess, how would you characterize first customer orders, and then, customer conversations in this current period of uncertainty?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
so right now, currently, what's in our backlog, we're not seeing any cancellations of our backlog. and that's consistent with what we saw kind of in the '15, '16 time frame. but we do see some push out of deliveries.
james west -- energy analyst
ok.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
and that's what a lot of the conversation was, i think some of our -- some of the larger operators are still in the planning mode of what does their new program look like. so, i'm not sure we've seen everything from them yet. the independents work a little faster. but to be honest, james, i've also been on executive-level calls on projects that we have ongoing to ensure that dril-quip is a critical supplier to the success of the project continues to stay focused and deliver.
so, it's a mixed bag, quite honestly, it goes both ways. on the pricing side, our customers really are aware that they asked for concessions in '15, and then, they asked again in '16 and we complied as best we could in those time periods. but throughout the cycle, we haven't raised prices at all. and dril-quip has worked hard to restructure our company and get our cost out, which is what you saw us do in the back half of '18 and all through '19 with the last transformation.
so that we were able to operate profitably at those pricing levels. so they understand, i think and our message to them is that, unfortunately, there's just not a lot of room to bring prices down further. there's been no increase in prices since the last downturn. so our focus to them is really, hey, we've spent a lot of time, energy, money on these new products and those new products are designed to save you money.
and that's where we'd like to have the conversation on how you can become more cost effective.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. ok. so do you think, blake or jeff, that -- i guess, how should we think about non-project inbounds in the near term? and we were doing kind of $50 million, $60 million a quarter. does that take a dip here? or could that be kind of consistent?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
so it's challenging, james, because there's just so much uncertainty in -- across the entire sector, not just in the ofs space, but on the e&p side as well. the best i can do to guide is, say, if you look back to kind of the 2015 to '17 period, we kind of clipped along at about that $50 million quarter bookings rate. and that's about as good as we can get. and i don't think we're going to know what the answer it is until we get a real sense of what the demand looks like coming out of this covid-19 issue.
james west -- energy analyst
sure. sure. how much of the inbound head you've been seeing over the last several quarters was from new products that you've introduced in the market in the last several years?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we had -- through '19, our inbound bookings, percentage of bookings that was new products was about 13%. we were targeting 14%. so we hit 13%, so pretty much on target.
but if you combined new products and/or new customers, about 30% of our bookings fell into that bucket and some of them were a double overlap. but still, we were making really good traction in that space. but a lot of that inbound was targeted to the sps side of the business, which we have a relatively small market share. we were seeing a lot of traction there, but that traction was primarily with independents.
james west -- energy analyst
right.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
and independents seem to be the first to shut down. so i think, we're going to see a slower uptake in that new products, particularly on the sps side until this market starts to recover.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. ok. well, and maybe turning to the downturn and the current macro situation. in the supplemental earnings deck, it shows a pretty dramatic drop in subsea equipment market demand since february.
what kind of macro framework was designed for these to show the significant estimate declines in '21 through '23? what -- i mean, what kind of oil price or outlook is that is backing that up?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- well, first off and not being critical of the people that make those prognostications. but we all know it's difficult to predict the future. and -- but this is our best guess at what the future holds.
and to be honest, the big macro thing is really just the supply demand. and we were already operating at a slight oversupply, i think, producing about 103 million barrels a day and consuming about 100 million. but when the demand destruction happened, we went down 20%, 30%, maybe 35% on the demand side. so all of a sudden, the way i like to think about it is every three days, enough oil has gone in storage to service the world for a full day at its prior pre-covid capacity.
so once the demand comes back up, there's this massive amount of oil and storage that has to get consumed before we're going to see pricing improvement and increased activity, and i think that's what's driving those charts.
james west -- energy analyst
right. ok. and so is this -- the way you're thinking about and streamlining the organization, are you basing that on kind of those charts and that prognostication?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. just simply put, yes, is the answer. but as good companies do, we have a plan for the worse and a plan for the better. we've gone through and modeled, ok, if it gets worse, what are the levers that we can pull.
and so that we don't have to start to do the plan in the middle of a crisis. we simply say, ok, let's pull out the new playbook. and on the other side, if we get an uptick, we're not destroying any manufacturing capacity that we can't put back in place. so i think if things get better, we'll be in a position that we can respond to the market and supply the products and services that it needs.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. how much cash do you need? and you're in the enviable position of having a lot of cash, so this is good. but how much cash do you need to run the business in this kind of lowered environment?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, i do like having the cash on the balance sheet, and i'll let jeff take that one for you.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah. i think in the current environment, we probably need $50 million to $75 million of cash to really run the business with current revenue expectations.
james west -- energy analyst
ok.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
and just to be clear, the way that we think about it going into this year, as we started the year with around $415 million in cash. we've talked about cash neutrality in the year. and to us, what that simply means is, look, we've got a stock buyback program in place and we would make sure that we're properly balancing our free cash flow and that stock buyback program so that we would target ending the year with $415 million in cash, just as we began the year with $415 million of cash.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. ok. great. and then, how are you prioritizing your capex at this point? are we going down to kind of pure maintenance level?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah, we have guided a higher number, obviously, in a different market that seems like a long, long time ago now. but we're now at maintenance capex. the maintenance capex should be between $10 million and $15 million. some of the footprint rationalization that we're about to undertake will be minimal capex, might cost $1 million $2 million, but that should easily fit within that $10 million to $15 million guidance.
james west -- energy analyst
right. ok. ok. and then what about r&d spending, given -- i mean you guys are a technology leader.
so i suspect it does not -- we're not going to zero here, but what are you prioritizing for r&d?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, james, so our focus on the r&d had been really in the sps space. we have the hpht facility in singapore that we added in -- or started in 2016 and we used that facility, as well as, our houston facility for the past few years. and the reality is, if you look at subsea tree awards, we were clipping along kind of at the 300 to 350 trees a year pace. i think now we're somewhere in the 100 to 130.
that market has certainly gotten smaller. so there's not a lot of urgency to build that product line out right now. so -- and we did just receive an award from otc for our new subsea tree, we call it vxte. and i do believe this product is significantly differentiated and there may be some opportunities to just kind of monetize the technology a bit.
so that's something that we are looking at. there -- so currently, our r&d efforts are really focused on what can we do on the short-term win, what are the things we can rapidly commercialize and generate some revenue in the next 12 to 18 months and make sure that the return on that investment is our significant priority.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. and i wanted to dig in, if we can, blake, on some of the new products that you and i have talked about over the last couple of years. and of course, all these are -- have won the spotlight award -- technology spotlight awards at otc. the bigbore wellhead, the wellhead connector, the double expansion liner hanger, and then, the vertical tree, the xte that you mentioned in your comments just a second ago, how has the introduction of those been into the market? could you maybe parse between the products and what is the customer acceptance? and are you actually winning new customers? i think you highlighted to me maybe what it feels like years ago, but i think it was like three months ago that they were getting some good acceptance with some customers you really hadn't done a lot of work for in a while.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
right. yeah. so first off, there's a common theme among all those products. when we started this process, i challenged our r&d engineers, say, look, i want you to design equipment that structurally changes how our customers drill wells offshore, that gives them permanent cost savings.
so this was significantly focused on not giving supply chain and making things smaller, cheaper, lighter, but on structurally changing, eliminating trips, minimizing days offshore. because our view is that eventually -- although, it seems a long ways away now, but eventually, prices are going to recover, rig rates are going to go up, and that spread cost is going to go up. and if we can save time, that is significantly more valuable. so every one of these products is focused on time, savings.
some more than significant than others. i can tell you the vxte, the vertical tree system that we just won the spotlight award on, we took that to a major operator. we showed them the concept. their subject matter expert pulled out a piece of paper, start scribbling down, and he said, you just saved me $3 million to $4 million per completion.
that's meaningful savings. and so you're right. we were seeing uptick on these new products, bigbore-iie. we had several independents.
some were converting their existing inventory to bigbore-iie. the dxe wellhead connector is going to be significant in the 20,000 development space. so that's been selected as the profile and connector of choice. the xpak liner is -- i've got customers asking for that.
so, it is significantly eliminates risk when running those bigbore liner hangers through the wellheads. and so all these things have an interest. and to be honest, right now, i think, we're in a position where the major operators may be more willing to look at these new systems because they're more risk-averse than an independent. but now, we're in an environment where we desperately need to pull cost out.
and i'm hopeful that we can get some messaging or i can get some messaging up at the executive level and we push this down, and we get some more traction on getting some of these products introduced into major operators.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. and are you seeing the difference in behavior between -- and you alluded to a little bit of the independents earlier, but the large iocs, the nocs and the independents as we kind of get into the downturn here?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
we are. it was stark, almost the difference between them. within a week, we had independents saying, these were my go-forward plans, i'm not doing that anymore. and i think, if you break the capex reductions down by those three categories, you would see that play out.
independents very quickly shut down for, i will say, for the most part. i will say, we do have a couple of customers that say, hey, it's cheap to drill now. i'm going to drill now. that are independent.
so it's not a one size fits all. the iocs are more, i think, are just more pragmatic about how they view and make their plans. it just takes them a little longer. and so, we are seeing delays in awards and push out of programs from those customers.
and then nocs, it's a mixed bag. it depends if you're an exporter or you're a net importer. one of the things that i saw in the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, when i was working in asia pacific, c&o oc just kept drilling because they're not selling on the open market, it's for internal consumption. and so, we've actually seen some increase in noc activity.
but some that are on the export side that they're winding down activity. so it's a mixed bag.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. and maybe we could just hop around the world of some of your key markets here and start with brazil. you have a great relationship with petrobras. you talked earlier about how they -- your facility guys shut down and they were able to get it -- get back up and going.
we haven't yet seen a lot of contract or tender cancellations in brazil. how are you feeling about that market as we go through this year?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
well, you're right. we do have a good relationship with petrobras and we actually have a pretty strong position in that market. as you -- you're probably well aware, the historic wellhead providers down there is dril-quip, and then, the veco portion of baker hughes. and we always tended to split that business about 60-40, with dril-quip getting the 40%.
but what we understand now, currently, petrobras is running around 18 rigs and dril-quip wellheads are on 12 of them. so of the consumption of dril-quip wellheads is going at a quicker pace. and so, that's -- we find that as a positive sign. we've heard a little bit petrobras announcing they're going to cut back some of their exploration program.
but they also are involved in 17 production sharing agreements with some significant majors and those tend to -- those seem to be continuing. we did win an award with -- from an ioc in brazil and we are executing that work now. we won that last year. so even though petrobras is announcing some delays in their program, i think, we're expecting to see some replenishment cycle for wellheads in brazil kick off in the second half of this year.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. that's great. what about europe and the gulf of mexico? i know that you had some unfavorable mix in these markets last quarter. is that temporary? and does that improve going forward, at least the mix, maybe the volumes are lower, but the mix gets better?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so again, we haven't experienced any significant cancellations in the drilling programs around the world. but the gulf of mexico was probably the most impacted. the independents, as i said before, reacted quickly.
so it's a little more muted in the gulf. but there are some bright spots in activity, what i'm going to say in the west. so mexico is still going to be active. there's wells that are committed there.
exxon in guyana is still hot, of course, and we're working to try and secure wellhead and tube work here. and then, of course, as i mentioned, in brazil. the mix issue really is anybody that's followed us before knows we make a product that we call a fabricated joint. so, we manufacture the connectors that go on the end of a piece of pipe and we buy the pipe.
and so, the pipe is a relatively low-margin pass-through and the profit is in the connectors and the fabrication work. and so, the consolidated margin of that is a drag when it happens. i always view that as a positive indicator because it means if we're selling pipe and connectors in excess of wellheads, it means that wellheads are being consumed from inventory and we're getting closer to a reorder cycle. so that's -- it's kind of a good news, bad news.
but it is transitory. i don't expect that to change, to be honest, over the second quarter and probably not the third. we'll just see how it plays out. in europe, that's probably the place that we're seeing the largest number of delays.
but again, not cancellations, just pushing out. a lot of that's in west africa. surprisingly, one of the bright spots in europe is norway. we've seen a few wells announced up there by conocophillips, an exploration program, and so we're looking for that.
so, i think once we can kind of get through the covid delays and that gets behind us, i think we're going to see some activity in norway pickup.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. good. and then perhaps maybe we'll just finish up on asia and what you guys are experiencing there. i mean, you talked a little bit about the covid disruptions.
but as that clears, how does that market look to you?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so asia actually is a bright spot for us. cnooc is actually speeding up. we have four tenders in-house for cnooc.
so that's a positive sign. i think i mentioned them before, is kind of an noc that's continuing on. myanmar has -- still has some activity with both woodside and pttep. that work seems to be holding up well.
and then for us, asia pacific also includes the middle east. there's been some covid delays there, but i think, there's some opportunities that we're seeing out of the middle east. we got a big tender for tubulars for kuwait oil company. and then, we got some surface wellheads and mudline equipment that's really kind of a saudi and uae thing.
and then of course, our liner hangers from tiw have pretty good presence in that area as well.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. so maybe another financial question for you guys. you've historically -- when you've had these share repurchase programs, you've acted pretty quickly. but i was up -- i was a little bit surprised to see you buy $25 million worth of stock in the quarter.
now you've got a rock-solid balance sheet. so it doesn't -- it's -- i'm not worried about it. but can you walk through your thinking around the timing of the buyback? why you went ahead and acted now and didn't conserve that cash?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah. sorry about that, blake.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so as i talked about earlier, we've got a philosophy of cash neutrality in the year. we started the year with that actually thinking about it that way. candidly, it's not surprised the way we started the quarter and the way that we ended the quarter were a little different from a macro environment.
so that's kind of the underlying premise. we thought it was a good buy at the beginning of the year. i think, we ended up a little over $30 a share, perhaps on the total buyback. having said that, i think that as we progress now through the next two quarters, we'll be pretty cautious in watching the market and seeing how the full-year free cash flow unfolds.
obviously, we're still relatively confident that we'll end the year at that $415 million number or around that number. but if things start to play out a little bit better than certainly, i think -- we think, we'll rethink what we do on the balance of the year on the cash -- or the stock buyback.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. makes sense. so with the pristine balance sheet, you're one of the few companies that i think could execute on m&a rather swiftly. others are going to have to really be considerate about it and deal with some restructurings and things that are going to happen in other parts of the service industry.
so what's your kind of guiding principle, what are your guiding principles on m&a? are there certain technologies you may focus on? and then, how do you think about kind of the new technologies that are coming to the oilfield or merging the oilfield like ai and machine learning?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah. so first, let me say, i think transaction in this environment are pretty challenging. it's pretty challenging to put your head around what valuation looks like. so i'm relatively skeptical something would happen in the short term.
but if we think about it in terms of guiding principles, i think blake and i, our attitude is, we're not going to risk the balance sheet. we talk a lot about the rock-solid balance sheet. we're not going to risk that. so first and foremost, i think any transaction that we execute would have to be free cash flow neutral in pretty quick fashion.
we would never make an acquisition where we bleed cash for 12 to 18 months or anything like that. i think second, it's got to provide some significant scale to be relevant in the current market. i don't think that we would want to go out as an example and make an acquisition where somebody has a 3% share and hope to grow an already crowded market. we want to look at an acquisition that already had a 15% to 20% market share as an example in their target market before we'd even think about an acquisition in that regard.
and then obviously, we're just coming through our strategic plan and we know exactly what those are. so easy to have a clear strategic rationale on value creation and customer behavior. we just spent a lot of time -- it's actually an interesting time to do this. we spent a lot of time on voice a customer and just making sure that we understand what customers are really looking for.
so any acquisition that we do would also be based on that. and then, the last piece is what i kind of started with is, it's got to be transactual and executable in the current market. but i'd venture to say, while we certainly have a strong enough balance sheet to make acquisitions and to be opportunistic, i just don't see it in the next six to nine months to be candid with you.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. and anything on the kind of new technology side that fits into that kind of target list that you guys are putting together?
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
yeah. we're always looking at those small tuck-in acquisitions. but i think as blake mentioned earlier, right now, we're very focused on near-term revenue and near-term profitability. so as we winnow down that list of technology opportunities, i think if it's a technology that we feel like we could quickly tuck-in and quickly capitalize on, we'd certainly be open to that.
but it's not something where i think we'd make an acquisition or do a tuck-in and expect a five- to 10-year realization from a top line. it would be really short term [inaudible]
james west -- energy analyst
understood. understood. well, gentlemen, that's all i had for today. i told you, we'd keep it to under 45.
it looks like actually, for once, been successful in doing that. i appreciate you guys joining. any parting thoughts, blake or jeff, before i let you guys go?
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'd just say that it never feels good to be in a downturn, but if i'm going to be in a downturn, i want to do it with the balance sheet we have, with no debt and cash in place. but we are keenly focused on execution and focused on free cash flow to preserve our strength. and really, finally, we have a history of returning value to shareholders and we're going to continue to do that in the future.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. great. well, blake, jeff, thanks for joining me today. hang in there as this downturn kind of unfolds.
you obviously have the rock-solid balance sheet to get you through. we look forward to kind of watching to see how this plays out. but i think, you're -- you can come out of this even stronger than you went in. so congrats on keeping that fortress balance sheet and we'll talk again here soon.
blake deberry -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, james.
jeff bird -- senior vice president of production operations and chief financial officer
thanks, james.
james west -- energy analyst
ok. thanks, everybody.

2020-Q4,DRQ,2021-02-26 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to dril-quip's year-end 2020 conference call. i'd like to turn the event over to mr. blake holcomb, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
blake holcomb -- director of investor relations.
welcome to dril-quip's full year 2020 conference call. [operator instructions] an updated investor deck was posted under the investors tab on the company's website yesterday along with the earnings release and will be referenced during today's call. this call is being recorded, and a replay will be made available on the company's website following the call. before we begin, i would like to remind you that dril-quip's comments may include forward-looking statements and discuss non-gaap financial measures.
it should be noted that a variety of factors could cause dril-quip's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results announcement released yesterday for full disclosure on forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-gaap measures. speaking on the call today from dril-quip, we have, blake deberry chief executive officer; and raj kumar, chief financial officer. we also have jeff bird, president and chief operating officer, on the call for the q&a portion following the prepared remarks.
i would like to turn the call over now to blake deberry.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
thank you. on behalf of the management team, i would like to welcome all of you to today's year-end conference call. i'll begin with a high-level review of our 2020 results and highlight the many accomplishments that we were able to deliver during the year. these accomplishments were achieved despite the tremendous challenges presented by the global pandemic. i will then turn the call over to raj to review the financial results and give general thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook. i will then provide some closing comments and open the call to questions.
i would like to begin with thanking dril-quip's employees globally for their resilience, dedication and remaining focused on performing their jobs with excellence. the pandemic brought immense challenges to our industry customers and our employees and their family. whether their jobs were performed in our manufacturing facilities, on a rig servicing our customers, or working remotely, all of our employees adjusted their lives for the good of the organization and in service to our customers. i am grateful for all their contributions.
although our 2020 results were challenged by the pandemic and associated oil and gas demand destruction, it was not a year without significant progress and accomplishments for dril-quip. the transformation and productivity journey we started in 2019 positioned us well for this challenging environment. we were able to conclude 2020 with $365 million of revenue and $32 million of adjusted ebitda. although a decrease from our 2019 results, we successfully responded to the challenging environment by mitigating the impact of the pandemic as seen in our operating and financial results and continued delivering products and services to our customers. we also celebrated many accomplishments in our research and development efforts during 2020.
in may, we were presented with our fifth spotlight on new technology award by the offshore technology conference for our vxte subsea tree system. the vxte system is a disruptive technology in the subsea production system space. vxte provides significant cost and time savings for our customers, which improves their irr by reducing capital and time to first oil, with the added benefit of reducing their carbon footprint. the vxte offers the operator the ability to drill the well to completion and land the tubing hanger in the wellhead as part of their normal drilling operations without regard to its orientation. this eliminates the traditional development well scenario, whereby the operator will cease drilling operations, pull the bop stack and run the horizontal tree or tubing spool and then rerun the bop stack to drill the well to completion.
we estimate that this, combined with our other e-series technology products, will save operators approximately $5 million per well and five days of rig time. we have seen incredibly positive response from our customers about the potential to improve their operations with this technology. our r&d and manufacturing teams worked hard through the pandemic to complete all qualification tests and maintain the production schedule of the first vxte tree. with the tree now in final assembly, we expect to make delivery in the first quarter and hopefully, installing the first vxte this year. while we are aware that consolidation is needed in our sector, we also know the difficulties in quickly executing that strategy.
accordingly, we embarked on a strategy of consolidation through collaboration. in 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with proserv for the manufacture and supply of subsea control systems. this nonexclusive collaboration achieved two main priorities. first, it allowed us to offer our customers the latest subsea controls technology without having to make the significant research and development investment of $8 million to $10 million per year over the next three years, as well as eliminated the associated operating costs of maintaining that product line. second, this win-win scenario allows us to bundle our award-winning subsea trees with proserv's state-of-the-art control systems and offer our customers significant value. the collaboration with proserv was part of a larger strategy to continue down our transformation path to align our business with market activity.
allowing us to refocus our engineering and manufacturing resources toward solutions that set us apart from our peers and offer the highest return on invested capital. this strategy led us to the difficult decision to transition and consolidate our subsea tree manufacturing from aberdeen to houston as we saw the subsea tree market decline from close to 300 subsea trees to a little over 100 tree awards in 2020. aberdeen is a critical location for our operations, and therefore, we still have a significant presence there. this includes sales, project management, fabrication, final assembly and aftermarket operations serving our customers. in total, the productivity initiatives executed in 2020 reduced our costs by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis and helps us to continue on maintaining profitability and a strong balance sheet.
as we view the market today, it seems probable that a longer, more gradual post-pandemic recovery is likely. this means it could take several years to return to 2019 activity levels. the recovery is also likely to vary by geography and customer profile. low-cost areas of offshore development, like the caribbean, or with the support from subsidies and parts of the north sea, are expected to see activity levels remain steady. the same can be said for national oil companies that typically drill for domestic energy consumption. in contrast, the most recent developments in the u.s. regulatory environment through executive order has created uncertainty around future projects in the u.s. gulf of mexico.
overall, our outlook on the market takes into account multiple factors, including demand recovery, supply control from opec, and increased emphasis by government regulators on transitioning toward less consumption of fossil fuels in favor of alternative energy sources. the energy transition is a process we believe should be guided by market forces and approached rationally with regulatory consistency. we recognize the transition is under way, but will take time and resources to accomplish. furthermore, we believe hydrocarbons will continue to play an important role in this transition, continuing to provide affordable, reliable and often cleaner energy to help lift developing nations out of poverty, while developed nations move more toward alternative energy sources. dril-quip has a role to play in both parts of the transition solution.
as part of our commitment to this transition, we have always prioritized helping our customers efficiently produce hydrocarbons and our latest e-series suite of products continues that legacy. many of our customers have made pledges to reduce emissions or become carbon neutral in the coming years. a large part of these commitments, in some cases, as high as 70% reduction in carbon emissions, will come from the vendors who supply these companies. dril-quip's innovative line of products are green by design, offering significant reductions in material or equipment that must be installed. this design methodology, which has always been part of dril-quip's dna, eliminated the carbon associated with manufacturing equipment as well as reducing the offshore installation days.
these products are thoroughly tested to improve reliability, which leads to better well integrity and fewer workovers. for example, the combination of our e-series technologies can help reduce roughly 40 tons of steel from traditional operations. the elimination of this component alone reduces carbon emissions by approximately 70 tons as the process needed to produce the steel is no longer required. we look forward to continuing to lead in the technologies and products that help our customers achieve their operational objectives. however, as we make the energy transition together, we do not lose sight of the very important role the industry currently plays today in providing reliable, affordable energy, and we take great pride in being part of that solution as well.
with that, i will turn the call over to raj to review the financials and provide more details on our cost-cutting initiatives and 2021 outlook.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, blake, and good morning, everyone. i'm going to walk through q4 performance and also provide a review for the full year of 2020. we executed well, given the challenges we saw in the overall market. revenue for the fourth quarter fell slightly from the prior quarter to $87 million. this decline was mainly due to lower manufacturing production hours related to increasing levels of quarantines from rising covid-19 cases, seen mainly in the u.s. adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was $9 million, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. the same factors impacting our revenue fell through to the bottom line.
we also saw regional government subsidies implemented as a result of the pandemic being reduced during the quarter. for the full year 2020, our revenues were $365 million, a decrease of $50 million versus 2019. this was driven by the impacts of the pandemic on overall oil and gas demand. adjusted ebitda for the full year 2020 was $32 million, a decrease of $22 million from the previous year. we were successful in addressing this market decline by swiftly taking steps to reduce costs and optimize our global footprint. as a result of this execution, we saw our margin profile improve significantly in the second half of 2020 as we realize the benefit of these cost actions. we met our $20 million cost reduction target in 2020. these are always difficult decisions, but were necessary in this environment. we expect these cost reductions to be sustainable going forward. while most of our regions saw headwinds to product and leasing revenues during the year, our service revenue saw an increase year-over-year.
this was primarily due to an increase in installations from orders booked in previous years, coupled with the growth in our downhole tools business. our downhole tools business was able to outpace the market by gaining share in key markets in the middle east and latin america as a result of service quality and execution. i'll now move on to margins. gross margins were under pressure. but given the environment, it held up falling by only 3%. our decision to take actions early in the year helped to support margins as the year progressed. we saw ebitda margins improve 3% from the first half to the second half 2020 after normalizing for mix and the impact of disruptions related to covid-19. moving to sg&a expenses. for the fourth quarter of 2020, sg&a was $26 million, an increase of $5 million compared to the third quarter. this increase was mainly due to short-term legal expenses.
we expect these legal expenses to continue into the first half of 2021, mostly in connection with the trial currently scheduled for april. for the full year 2020, sg&a expenses decreased by $8 million to $90 million after excluding these short-term legal expenses. these improvements in sg&a stem from our 2020 cost out initiatives. on the engineering r&d side, we saw a modest increase in 2020 to $19 million as we work to bring the vxte to market. now looking at bookings for the year. product bookings were negatively impacted by the difficult market conditions in 2020. after approximately $388 million in bookings during 2019, the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its impact on commodity prices led to customers holding off or delaying decisions to book orders for their upcoming projects.
we saw smaller orders with less predictable timing. we now see one or two orders being the difference between a $40 million or a $60 million bookings quarter. we expect the effects of the pandemic to persist into the first half of 2021, but are cautiously optimistic that things will gradually recover as the year progresses. we believe there is some upside if operators see increased stability in prices and confidence in the global economic recovery returns with the recent rollout of covid-19 vaccines. we expect the road to recovery to be more gradual. we are taking actions related to our productivity initiatives driven by our lean management philosophy and are targeting a $10 million cost improvement on an annualized basis.
these savings will come primarily from changes in our manufacturing and supply chain functions, including an increase in outsourcing for our downhole tools business. the timing of these productivity actions will take place over the course of the year and is expected to deliver roughly $5 million of realized benefit in 2021. moving on to capital expenditure or capex. in the fourth quarter of 2020, our capex totaled just under $2 million. and for the full year, it was around $12 million. this represents a minimum maintenance level of capex that we have seen over the past two years. we are, however, anticipating an increase in capex to range in between $15 million to $17 million in 2021. the increase is partly related to growth in our downhole tools business. we are also investing in manufacturing safety and equipment and our information technology infrastructure.
we will monitor conditions to adjust our capex if necessary, but we believe these investments will support growth and improve our long-term efficiency and profitability. now let me turn to the balance sheet. we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on protecting our cash position with no debt. at year-end, we had cash on hand of $346 million and a further $40 million of availability in our abl facility. this results in approximately $386 million of available liquidity. our balance sheet and liquidity position are critical for us. it gives our customers confidence in our ability to execute on our commitments and provides financial flexibility.
moving on to free cash flow. free cash flow for the fourth quarter was a negative $18 million. for the full year, it was negative $33 million. both the quarter and full year free cash flow was slowed by several headwinds, many of which were related to the pandemic. firstly, we saw a number of large customers whole payments that were due at year-end until early in january. while we are accustomed to disturb our balance sheet management by our customers, this amount was beyond our normal experience. secondly, we saw inventory build in 2020, driven by customers requesting delays in shipments and our need to continue to procure materials for upcoming projects.
we also strategically added inventory for our expanding downhole tools business and subsea trees for stocking programs. both these factors led to an increase in inventory. these working capital increases were partially offset by a federal tax refund. we believe we have laid the foundation for a strong recovery. we executed in improving billing turnaround and worked to improve our collection efforts and expand payment terms with vendors. we expect we will see benefits of these efforts more clearly in 2021. free cash flow is a primary focus for us as a management team. we have tied all annual incentives for our entire leadership team to free cash flow.
we are focused on all aspects of working capital. we have dedicated a cross-functional team working on inventory reduction in a more gradual recovery environment. our auditor cash teams are gaining traction on reducing time to bill. and we are continuing to leverage our supply base by moving to a more vendor-managed inventory program. in the current environment and given the initiatives i just mentioned, we expect to be able to generate 5% free cash flow yield. the bottom line is that free cash flow is a key metric for the management team. prior to turning the call back over to blake for closing comments, i will give some color on what we expect to see in 2021. based on the current view and the conversations with customers, we expect 2021 bookings to be around $200 million for the year.
at these product booking levels and with the anticipated growth in our downhole tools business, we expect to see revenue to come in flat to slightly down from 2020. we are forecasting 40% decremental margins for any given decline in revenue as we hold costs critical to address a recovery. as i mentioned earlier, we are forecasting a free cash flow yield around 5% in 2021. we are well positioned to achieve this goal and have aligned management objectives and incentives toward meeting this target. to sum up, while we see near-term headwinds from the hangover of the pandemic, we see a gradual recovery in sight. we have a proven track record of executing and meet these near-term challenges head on as we prepare for the recovery and focus on our strategic initiatives. we have a strong financial position and a strong management team to execute in this market environment.
with that, i will turn the call back over to blake.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
thanks, raj. as we enter 2021, we believe there are signs to be optimistic that a recovery, even a more gradual one, is beginning to take form. we have established several strategic initiatives, which will position dril-quip to thrive in the years ahead. first, we are continuing to progress our consolidation through collaboration strategy through peer-to-peer collaborations that help to expand market access for our technology. we see these collaborations through several lenses.
with respect to vxte, we believe via conversations and significant pull from both customers and peers in the market that vxte monetization remains a midterm opportunity via dril-quip providing the ip kit to our peers for delivery to end customers. with wellheads, as a best-in-class wellhead provider, we believe both our superior technology and qualification lend themselves to partnering with multiple peers in integrated offerings. finally, with our connectors, we believe that real opportunity exists to partner with pipe providers around the world to build out better supply chains to improve delivery to our customers. the common theme of these strategies is to expand share while reducing overall industry capacity. second, we have a downhole tool business that we believe has not fulfilled its potential.
we would expect to have a business here that has a market share similar to our wellhead franchises in most markets. quite frankly, we've struggled over the last few years with that business. but we've laid the foundation in 2020 for significant growth in 2021. we have a new leader. we've shuttered underperforming bases. we place smart bets with stock and added business development resources in key regions. further, we are only beginning to capitalize on our technology as outlined via our xpak de technology. finally, as i'm sure you followed, we've moved from an organization of transformation to an organization that demands real annual productivity improvements.
these productivity initiatives span our organization and will make us nimble in difficult times while allowing us to scale up when the market returns. productivity and lean are now the way we do business and will serve us well in good and bad times. as we look to the market increasingly focused on energy transition, we are continuing to be green by design, delivering lower carbon options for our customers, continuing to drive r&d that reduces the carbon footprint for our customers and following our customers in their transition. while we are in the early stages of our r&d, rest assured that you can expect us to bring the same level of innovation to energy transition that we have to our customers over the last several decades.
in conclusion, the culmination of all these efforts leads to increasing market share by using technology and execution as a differentiator. we will be keenly focused on free cash flow generation in a competitive free cash flow yield to attract investment and ultimately benefit our shareholders. as raj indicated, we are continuing several key working capital reduction initiatives in 2021. we take these commitments seriously and have tied our annual performance compensation toward meeting these goals. i look forward to providing further updates on the progress we are making across all our strategic areas in the coming quarters and sharing the benefits of success with our employees, customers and shareholders.
i will now turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] first question comes from sean meakim with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. hey, good morning.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
good morning.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i'm really starting to enjoy these annual chat that you guys put together. a lot of great information. so thanks for doing it. to start off with orders, i think it's really -- one of the key focuses for investors, in the short term, the $40 million to $60 million per quarter guide is in effect setting the bar at not only trough levels. and maybe the midpoint implies a bit better than what you've got in 2020, but it's a similar range or how you've been thinking about the business.
but beyond '21, i think there's more room for optimism, as you noted, in terms of where in the macro, where offshore spending can go? and then specifically to dril-quip, there's the potential for the new product innovations to garner more awards and then the peer partnerships also seem to offset the possibility of faster growth relative to what the overall market offers. so maybe could you just help us think about what are the -- if we're to have this conversation a year from now, and we look back on what '21 offered you. what are the potential outcomes that could deviate from that base case range? and if anything, it would be nice to kind of do a little more block building toward what the medium-term looks like as some of these initiatives actually flow through into the financials?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
so, sean, let me pass that to jeff because he's doing a lot of work on the peer-to-peer stuff, which i think is probably the biggest focus here. so...
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so a few comments there. we talk about that $40 million to $60 million range. if you look at the first half of the year, it's probably going to be closer to that $40 million range, ramping up in the back half of the year. if we think about things like peer-to-peer and some of the large tenders, let me separate those out. there are a number of items right now from a tender standpoint that are in play. they keep getting pushed out month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter right now.
so we're optimistic those are going to land in the year, but we're optimistic that they're likely to land in the back half of the year. now as we've talked about earlier, there's not a lot -- it doesn't take a lot to move something above or below that $40 million to $60 million range. but i think you should expect that to be $40 million to $60 million on the low side at the beginning, high side at the end. if we think about the peer-to-peer, we're already working on a number of those relationships today.
you likely won't see a big splash around that in the first half of the year. but i think if you're sitting here a year from now, what you'd probably see is increased bookings as a result of those peer-to-peer relationships. so we're having great conversations in a number of areas. and those will start to show up in the bookings, probably the last half of this year, probably candidly more the fourth quarter of this year in a meaningful way and maybe early next year. if we think about the peer-to-peer, just touching on those, there's really two or three areas we see that. we've talked a lot about wellheads and our wellhead conversations are probably more advanced than any of our other conversations. and think about that as really an opportunity that instead of us selling the wellhead to an end customer, often our customers like to buy the tree and the wellhead together. and this is an opportunity for us to work with other tree providers to provide the wellhead to them.
so they've got a more competitive offering to the end customer. on the connector side, we're a little bit earlier stages in that connector side, but there's really some opportunities there, we believe, to pair up with pipe manufacturers around the world and be more thoughtful about how we can provide a better supply chain to our end customers. and then we've talked a great deal about vxte monetization and that's probably a little -- that's probably the furthest out of any of them. there's some technology work that needs to be done with a number of the tree providers there, but there is interest both on a customer side and on a tree provider side as well.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
that's great. yes, i think that really frames the short-term and the medium-term well. so then maybe on margin progression. so you noted revenue flat to down in '21. that makes sense based on how orders shook out and what you're expecting for this year, 40% decrementals, you're holding for a recovery. can we maybe just focus on gross margins and talk about the potential range of outcomes there, the different levers, whether it's mix, throughput, etc, just how we think about the progression for gross margins, i think, would be helpful.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
sean, this is raj. yes, talking about profitability in relation to gross margins. if i look into 2021, i talked about the 40% decrementals. we are holding a bit of cost in anticipation of the recovery that jeff has alluded to. and in terms of mix, we're seeing a very similar mix from '20 going into '21. so i wouldn't say there's any major shift there. the thing that we're going to be cognizant of is the cost actions that we did last year are going to flow through. the full year annualized cost actions are going to flow through into this year. so that's going to be a help there.
we're also shifting our focus. i mean, we've always had this lean focus, this productivity focus, and that's going to help us this year. we are looking at $10 million of upside there, of which $5 million would hit into 2021. so on an annualized $10 million is a good guide. we are seeing some headwinds. i talked on the call about -- early on in the script, i talked about the lapsing of the government subsidies. so that's going to be a headwind for us in terms of margins. that's around $3 million to $4 million of headwind that we're going to see. and we have, in this environment, reinstated some -- the variable compensation. i mentioned we have tied that to the free cash flow initiative because that is so critical for us in this environment. but that's also in some estimation, a headwind for us. so those are the puts and takes as i look at margins going forward.
sean meakim -- jpmorgan -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks everybody. thanks, john.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
thank you.

the next call comes from james west of evercore isi. please go ahead.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. james question on free cash flow. and understanding that you guys are focused on it and management compensation is tied to it. so there's definitely -- it's a target area for you. is there something within perhaps the inventories that you're unable to move because of longer cycle equipment? or is this -- what are we missing? why are we not converting some of the working capital faster than one would expect?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
so james, thanks for the question on the inventory aspect of working capital. last year was a unique year, right? so we had to deal with the delays, the both on the customer side as well as on the vendor side, where we had to receive stuff a bit early and then we had shipment interruptions, etc. so there were some headwinds against what -- on the inventory side.
now i want to shift to '21 and with what we've put together in terms of information technology, around inventory and being better able to manage it, given the tools that we've put in place, i think you're going to see a very different environment in '21, granted that we are flat to slightly down in terms of revenue. so it's more of a gradual recovery, and that's a headwind in terms of inventory liquidation. but i can quite confidently say that we should see a year-over-year decrease on total inventory levels. you should expect anywhere from $15 million, with a stretch, maybe up to $20 million of inventory reduction.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. okay. great to hear. and then, i think a question from me, maybe for blake. within the customer base right now. i would assume that any inventory they had taken from you or any -- or as they taken from you, they kind of destocked this already, whether it's wellheads on especially, but i guess, one, is that the case? and two, could that lead to perhaps some type of -- i understand the market will be a gradual recovery, but maybe a little bit more of a bump when people get back to -- as people get back to work because they need to kind of restock their own inventories?
blake holcomb -- director of investor relations.
yes, that's a good observation, james. so unlike the in '14, '15 time frame where our customers had a pretty high anticipation of activity level they cut back. we don't have that in this down cycle. and our customers had pretty much burned through their inventory in that period. and so currently, where we believe their inventory is with the activity level, it's not going to take much -- many wells drilled before that inventory is burned down, and then the reorder cycle will commence. so once the activity level picks up, i think you're going to see bookings respond pretty quickly.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. okay, all right, great, thanks guys. thanks, james.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
thank you.

next question from taylor zurcher, tudor, pickering and holt. please go ahead.
taylor zurcher -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
morning.
taylor zurcher -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
morning. the first question is on some of the comments you made on the energy transition. clearly, the e-series of products you have is one avenue to kind of effectuate that change, at least within your existing product portfolio. you also mentioned in the presentation some opportunities you're exploring around carbon capture and storage and geothermal. and so i'm curious on that kind of suite of the market or section of the market. are those things that you could apply your existing skill set and existing technology know how to kind of wait into? or would we be thinking more about sort of some inorganic growth opportunities to kind of weight into those markets?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so this is jeff. we've done a couple of things there, rightly, as you point out, all of our customers have a carbon reduction target. and most of those targets, we believe, are going to come on the back of their vendors. so we're doing the right things there from green-by-design standpoint to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint. if you think about carbon capture specifically, that's an area where, candidly, there's a fair amount of overlap right now, and we have products that we could bring to bear almost immediately around carbon capture.
and then as you think longer-term on the renewable side, that's where we'll follow our customers. we've really done a good job, i think, over the last five, six, 10 years on the r&d front. so we do think we have the intellectual horsepower internally to bring r&d to bear in that area as well. to that end, we've actually recently carved out a specific group that's now working directly for me. to start to look at both carbon reduction, carbon capture and then longer-term around the renewable side as well. we wouldn't be afraid of m&a. but right now, i think we're looking at it more from an organic standpoint than an inorganic standpoint.
taylor zurcher -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
okay. great. and my follow-up, you touched on sort of the margin profile moving forward. and you'll get some extra cost out with the lean initiatives. on the flip side, the government subsidies rolling off will be a bit of a negative headwind. and then the other negative headwind are some of these covid impacts that are still having a meaningful impact on the margins today. can you just talk about how you see some of that covid impacts hopefully lessening over the first half of the year? maybe it takes longer than that. but any color there would be helpful.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, taylor, this is raj here, by the way. if you look at last year, i think we had about a $15 million headwind from covid. this was due to all the delays and all the issues we had in terms of manufacturing, etc. going into this year, i would expect that as the year progresses and as vaccinations get rolled out, as the year progresses, i would expect that, that sort of that sort of headwind trend line is going to abate, evidently, for the first half of the year. i'm not as confident as the back half of the year, taylor.
taylor zurcher -- tudor, pickering and holt -- analyst
dealer ok, understood. thanks for your honest the answers. thank you.
operator
next question comes from connor lynagh, morgan stanley. please go ahead.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i think,james is asking something along these lines. but i was wondering if you could just sort of sketch out if we're thinking about cash flows for 2021. and ultimately, where i'm driving with this is trying to think through the exit rate. but can you just help us understand big cash moving pieces, how much of working capital release you're expecting? and basically, what i'm wondering is if you could sort of frame for us as we look out longer in time, is this mid-single-digit free cash margin, how we should think about your business? do you think you can do better? do you think you can do worse? just thoughts around that.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
connor, this is raj. yes. so talking about the major facets of free cash flow, right, looking at working capital. on the dso side, on the accounts receivable side, last quarter was a horrendous quarter in terms of our customers managing their balance sheet and doing window dressing at the end of the year. we expect that situation to improve. it's just that we're stepping up our collections efforts. we are getting more in tune with our customers and understanding how they're going to convert accounts receivable to cash. i do expect that those gymnastics that they play are going to happen every quarter. so we've kind of factored that in.
we're going to do what we can control. i'm going to say that i expect this year with whatever we are doing, that dso should improve about 30 days year-over-year. on the inventory side, i already talked about -- i mentioned to james, i'm looking at a $15 million to $20 million release of inventory, given all the actions that we put in place around there. on the dpo side, it's probably going to be around the periphery. we're running around 60 days. there's still some opportunity, but it's not going to be that as material as what you're seeing on the inventory and the ar side. we also have, from a cash position, opportunity that was delayed due to the pandemic last year from real estate sales.
so we do expect $6 million to $7 million of real estate sales that should come in this year to help in our cash position. so with all of these, i would say that i expect a 5% yield on revenue, right, on revenue is achievable in 2021. in fact, if i was looking at q1, i'd say we could potentially meet or exceed that number. and on a longer-term basis, you've got to understand that we are a long-cycle business. we have a projects component to our business. and when there is a recovery, there is going to be some build to inventory, right, because of the project nature. and when we look over the cycle, i would say that a 3% to 5% yield on revenue is a reasonable expectation.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. there was a lot of helpful context there. so appreciate it. i mean, i guess just at a higher level, you've got a very substantial cash balance. you'll be free cash positive this year, admittedly, some of that's working capital. but how do you think about that cash balance? what's the sort of investment priorities, return of capital? you've talked in the past somewhat about m&a. but i think if we look at other sectors of the economy, the context has been that valuations are quite high because of what's going on in the public markets, but just any thoughts around that would be great.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so i talked about keeping some dry powder for a recovery. we remain cautiously optimistic over '21. but going into '22, we think the market is going to be a bit more buoyant than what we're seeing right now, evidently. so we have to put aside maybe $150 million to $200 million to help us there on the upside. we do look at m&a. we look at the r&d side, things that can accelerate our technology road map, that will probably be cash related. but on transformational r&d, we don't see using cash or debt for that matter in terms of getting a transaction done. on the transformational side, we will always stick to -- i think our equity is the best currency for us right now.
connor lynagh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] next question is from dave anderson of barclays. please go ahead.
dave anderson -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. question on brazil. this is a country you've had a strong presence in for many years. brazil might be one of the few offshore markets to grow this year. i'm pretty sure you fulfilled all -- most, if not all of the prior contract. i was wondering you just kind of talk about the status down there. does petrobras still have an inventory to work through? i believe a lot of that equipment wasn't still ok to move through. but maybe just kind of talk about in terms of what you heard about in new tender. i think you had talked about some of that a little bit in the past. so maybe just an update on brazil, please.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yes. certainly. so your memory is correct. petrobras had a substantial amount of inventory. when we first got those numbers, we kind of ran the math in their run rate. and we figured that 2020 would be the logical time they would come out for bid. and in fact, petrobras had announced they were doing multiple tenders for a total of 70 wellhead systems that, that was in the works during 2020. all of that work is still on the cards. the bids are still out there, but it has just slid to the right. so at present, we haven't -- we're in discussions with them about tenders coming up, but there is nothing active, but we do expect that to happen early on in '21.
dave anderson -- barclays -- analyst
and assuming that does come through, like where are you with your facility at macae down there? i'm assuming it's way scaled down now. i mean are there challenges to bring that back up to meet that? i mean if you're talking 70, that's not a huge number in terms of wellheads, but just how do you thinking about that?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. this is jeff. we still have the facility in brazil. and candidly, you're right to say we did scale it down some. however, we have had some recent activity there, and we're able to scale it back up again pretty quickly. so we're confident that if and when that order is received, that we'll be able to scale back up again. it shouldn't be a problem. we have a significant amount of work there from an aftermarket operation standpoint.
dave anderson -- barclays -- analyst
of course. i saw the new ceo in petrobras, so who knows where that's going. that's a totally different question. we don't have to talk about that today. one other question, jeff, you had talked about these partnerships with tree manufacturers on the wellhead side. something i've always kind of thought about, they certainly do go hand-in-hand. you're talking about pursuing those with some tree manufacturers. you, of course, have also -- are a tree manufacturer.
you've tried to build that market out for many years. so doesn't this create some conflicts out there with that? of course, we know that one of your major competitors there also is a tree manufacturer. so maybe can you just expand a little bit on that partnership agreement, please?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so the way we think about it is this, our sweet spot, really, from a tree standpoint, are the smaller independents, if you will, is our sweet spot. when you get into the larger, the iocs and some of the larger nocs, we're a little bit more challenged there from a tree standpoint. but candidly, we're probably better positioned from a wellhead standpoint than a lot of other tree manufacturers. so those customers where it's not necessarily our sweet spot, that's where we think it makes sense for us to partner with other tree providers and go to market.
and really, while we're talking about them independently, the vxte and that wellhead peer-to-peer kind of go hand-in-hand, if you think about it, right? imagine us providing the wellhead to those tree providers, but also perhaps supplying the vxte technology. as i said earlier, vxte is going to take a little bit longer because there's some technical hurdles that we've got to work through with the tree providers, but those are both opportunities that we don't really think will conflict. there might be a little bit of conflict at the edges, but not large.
dave anderson -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of -- when you say a partnership, does that mean a partnership in terms of how you're bidding out projects together? does that mean that's a partnership in terms of kind of marrying the technologies together and kind of integrating them? just maybe just a little bit more on that? sorry, i'm taking up so much time on the call today.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes, no worries. i think on the wellhead side, you'd probably likely see -- just think about it very simply as a price list with lead times and pricing that we would negotiate with a tree provider that we'd be able to provide them they would integrate our technology, our wellhead into their tree on that side. on the vxte side, it's a little bit more integrated. think about them providing the tree and us really providing the kit -- the ip kit, if you will, underneath the tree, which would, by the way, on vxte, would also include the wellhead.
dave anderson -- barclays -- analyst
thank you very much guys.

"
2021-Q1,DRQ,2021-04-30 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
luke lemoine -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining. my name is luke lemoine with capital one securities. and i am joined with dril-quip's ceo blake deberry and cfo raj kumar. blake and raj, thanks for taking the time to chat about dril-quip and the quarter today.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
thank you, luke, and thanks for hosting us.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, luke.
luke lemoine -- analyst
yeah, you bet. blake, could you maybe start-off with just some opening remarks about the quarter and some things you accomplished and some highlights there?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
sure, luke. first-off, i'm just really proud of the men and women of dril-quip that executed the quarter. the quarter was a really good quarter from my view. we're seeing our strategic growth pillars are helping to drive our bookings. so, bookings were up. we had really strong downhole tools growth, which we've been working on that business pretty strongly over the last year. and we're starting to see the impact of the cost reductions we did in 2020 show up in the results. so all in all, i'm very happy with the result.
luke lemoine -- analyst
good. maybe just to start with the orders there that were very strong at 1q, $57 million. you've guided kind of $40 million to $60 million, so at the top-end of that range. what's the outlook for the remainder of the year as far as quarterly orders? and do you see a pathway of getting back to that $80 million to $100 million range per quarter at some point next year?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
so yes, with respect to q1, we were pleased to have two horizontal tree booked for an operator in the gulf of mexico. and we did that in collaboration with proserv on the controls and that's one of our strategies is peer-to-peer collaboration. and we call it consolidation by collaboration. so that was a big win. going forward, we still believe that orders will be in that $40 million to $60 million range for 2021. but we see some strength happening in the back half of the year. so, we're hopeful that we'll be at the top-end of that range. as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, if that pace continues, then we would expect to see orders to continue to prove into 2022 and be at a potentially higher range of bookings.
luke lemoine -- analyst
maybe turning to your downhole tools that you mentioned in your opening remarks as well, had the highest quarterly revenue since[phonetic] the acquisition 4q '16 and revs doubled quarter-on-quarter. can you give us an outlook on how you expect this to trend the rest of the year?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think we're likely to see some lumpiness during the year. q1 was really strong in saudi arabia, because we had some carryover orders and mexico was also very strong. but downhole tools is one of our key growth pillars. and with the recent stocking program we initiated last year, we expect to see a meaningful growth year-over-year in that business in particular in saudi arabia, latin america and deepwater. and that's where we see our strength for that particular product line.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay. subsea, little lighter than we expected in the quarter, kind of got-off to a rocky starts, some delivery project delays. how should we think about the progression here for the remainder of the year?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's true. we're proceeding with some significant improvements in the u.s. in terms of covid restrictions and demand coming back, but the demand is still slower to recover in parts of europe and asia. and that's somewhat muting our subsea business. we're starting to -- really what we're seeing is the impact of the challenging bookings numbers that we had in 2020. so, it's not really surprising that the revenue is going to be a bit challenging through the year, but q1 was a good bookings quarter, and that's a good indicator of our future revenue. and as the vaccines become more widely distributed and economies open up, we expect to see that part of our business pick up accordingly.
luke lemoine -- analyst
so even with the subsea revs declining some in 1q, gross margins were very strong and showed a nice increase quarter-on-quarter. can you talk a little bit about the margin cadence for the balance of the year with your projected mix and the cost savings you've outlined?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. raj is probably best to talk about that. i'm going to hand that over to him.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, luke, thanks for allowing us to talk about our margins. we are extremely pleased with our margin performance in q1. we made good progress. as you recall, last year, we had some structural costs take-outs that was about $20 million. we're seeing the benefit of that play into this year. and we're also in a very good position in terms of this year's productivity gains. we started-off this year with $2.5 million of productivity gains. and as you recall, we are targeting about $10 million of productivity savings this year. from this, we expect supply chain savings from our downhole tools business to hit the latter part of the year. so if you think about it on the cost side, i think we've got tailwinds in terms of helping us from a margin perspective.
now if i shift to the mix side of things, this quarter, we saw help from the downhole tools revenue that we talked about -- that they talked about as well as aftermarket service revenue was strong this quarter. going forward, i expect to see some lumpiness in the near-term with -- we're seeing higher mix on fab joints and tubulars. it's actually a good sign for us, if we see our customers go back to work. so, i expect that as we progress through the year and go into the back half of the year, margins will hold and mix will become more favorable, and with the productivity gains, margins will start to firm up as we exit the year.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay, very good. i'm not sure what you can say at this point. but has there been any resolution with the litigation involving fmc with the trade secrets?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
it's a pretty timely question, luke. actually, we've just been through about a three-week jury trial. the jury did reach a verdict yesterday. and we received the verdict in our favor, which we are obviously very pleased with that outcome. and i have to say, we are grateful to the judge and the jury for their work on this case, because it really validates the tremendous work of our team to develop this technology. and it was done solely on our own with dril-quip resources. and so, we are just glad to have that behind us now.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay, congratulations on that. that's really good to hear. maybe turning to some operational and strategic items, you've mentioned in recent quarters your efforts to broaden your customer base, including looking at some of your peers as customers. how these conversations been progressing, how are peers responding and kind of what's the value proposition for everybody involved?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yeah, so, we're pleased with the initial discussions that we've had with a couple of our peers, primarily focusing on our subsea wellhead products. and really, the value proposition is, in my view, relatively simple. we've done some independent work on wellheads and market providers and we are considered a tier 1 provider and quite honestly want to be only tier 1 providers of subsea wellheads in this space. and so, that gives us the ability to provide a wellhead system to one of our peers that gives the latest technology to the end user.
and that's why i always find this, it's one of those rare circumstances where you have a win-win-win scenario, it's a win for dril-quip if we follow this model, because we get more volume through our manufacturing facility, reduce our manufacturing overhead. it's a win for our peer. they get the latest technology and offer to the customer end-user, but they can also choose to exit that market, if they -- if that's something they choose to do and reduce their costs. and it's definitely a win for the end user, because they're not tied to one specific set of equipment through some epc contract, that's all bundled together. they get the best of breed in multiple classes of equipment. and so, i think it's going to be a positive outcome and the conversations are continuing. and we're hopeful that we make some progress in this year.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay. we talked about the downhole tool business a little bit earlier. your good quarters there are making a lot of progress. this is the legacy tiw corporation that you acquired in late 2016 talked about it could be lumpy this year just quarter-to-quarter. but when you look longer term kind of multi-year, how do you modify store operations of business strategy? and what are your expectations kind of over a multi-year period for this?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
hey, raj, you want to take this question?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that blake, thanks. so first, luke, we brought in a new leader to that business and this individual has experience in the downhole tool business. and we -- he led the strategic review of what needs to be done in this business to grow it. and from that, we've made some inroads into standardizing our product offering. so that allows us to stock more easily. if you look at this business, it's a quick turn, quick execution, customer wants -- customer plays a high level of importance on service quality and execution. and you know, as a dril-quip customer satisfaction is number 1 priority for us. you saw the results of the energy point survey that point to that. so that's how we've approached it.
we have closed down some locations that we deemed are not performing. and we have become more focused on the markets where we are a leader and the markets where we expect there's going to be growth. so if you think about the middle east, latin america and the deepwater space, that's where we're going to be focusing the downhole tools business. and as you can see from q1 results, setting aside the lumpiness over the year, i think we're well on our way to make good year-over-year progress in this segment.
luke lemoine -- analyst
got you. the past year, you've been highlighting the e-series product line. how are you progressing, gaining acceptance for these products with your customers? and what are the challenges you're seeing in terms of adoption? and what are your goals for these technologies in the future?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
so yes, it was actually a good quarter for our e-series products. all of these products that we've developed over the last several years are bundled together with one primary goal, which is to structurally change how our customers drill wells to provide them permanent cost savings. and in q1, we ran our first bigbore iie, which was a success. and it's always good to get that first one done. we talked about what are the impediments that's usually the largest one is has somebody done it first. and so, the first bigbore iie is in the ground. also in q1, we ran our first expat te[phonetic], so that that's been done as well. so those are all positive signs.
we've been speaking with our customers about how all these products work together to reduce time and mitigate risk and lower the carbon footprint for our customers. and i think this is a very attractive proposition for them. and we're continuing to invest in technology. and we've applied for another spotlight award. we'll see what otc does for new our e-series product coming out. and hopefully, we'll see more of that in the coming months that's accepted. and we're going to market that whole series pretty heavily here coming up.
luke lemoine -- analyst
the vxte has been a product that you've shown enthusiasm for during the past year and even received some attention from your peers. so any update you can provide in terms of how the marketing of this products going, and when you could see some of these trees booked and possibly the first vxte installed?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yes, so -- i am -- that's a fair statement. i am very bullish on vxte. i think it is one of the most disruptive pieces of technology in the subsea development space. but in all honesty, the lawsuit did put a damper on some of our marketing efforts. and put that on pause, we had customers that said, hey, i like the product, but i don't want to get tangled up in the middle of the lawsuit. so, i'm going to put it on pause until the lawsuits resolved. so they were just waiting to see what happened before fully engaging. so now we believe these discussions are going to pick back up the trials behind us. and i think that will lead to more bookings and installations in the future.
our first vxte has been sold. that tree is in final assembly. it should be done here in the next month or so. and so, we look forward to getting that in the hands of our customers and this fitting for customer -- he uses the full value of what vxte allows you to do, which he has the tree and stock and they drill the well. and if it is a keeper and commercial, they go ahead and just do the completion right there and land the tree. so it's really a matter of when they're going to have the next opportunity to run it. once we get that one run like everyone else, every -- all these other new products, that'll be serial number one behind us. and i think that's when we'll see acceleration of that product into the market.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay. raj, we kind of touched on it earlier, but dril-quip set productivity targets for 2021. you made some progress toward these in the first quarter? how do you expect this progress for the remainder of the year and any challenges involved in reaching these targets? and maybe, if you can just kind of quantify how much of these costs do you think will be fixed versus variable with a market recovery?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
so luke, yeah, on the productivity gains, right, i'm very happy with the progress we've made in q1. as i mentioned, we got $2.5 million of savings, most of that was fixed in nature. we would like to see the biggest growth productivity gains coming in late q2 into q3, as we transition the downhole tools, business from an in-house manufacturing to a supply chain -- third-party supply chain model. and that's probably going to be more variable in nature, given its direct costs related to selling a product. so if i would sum it up fixed versus variable, i would say, early gains to zero are[phonetic] more fixed and as we move and progress through the back half of the year, it's probably going to be more variable coming from the downhole tool segment outsourcing initiative.
luke lemoine -- analyst
it may be just turning to kind of the market outlook, market for subsea has been very subdued since 2014. as we begin to see some improvement in commodity price and activity post-covid period, give a view as to when you could see pricing improve and have you seen competitors react in terms of pricing on fewer available projects?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
so yes, it's interesting to look at what's going on in the market. what we're really seeing is on large major -- what we call mega tenders, pretty high value, large quantity tenders, the pricing seems to be extremely aggressive. that's probably intuitive and what you would expect. and we are seeing a few competitors that are being aggressive in order just to keep their manufacturing facilities open. that's never been our strategy. i'm always happy to say i'm happy to win the second order at good margins rather than cut my margins just to secure the work. on a positive side, if we are seeing some push-outs in delivery, particularly on subsea trees and that as you will know, luke, is kind of often the precursor to better pricing for us. so, i think there is starting to come some scarcity, and that is always a positive for pricing.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay. a lot of talk in investment from your customers on energy sources outside of traditional oil and gas? how is dril-quip preparing for the shift spending? and how do you see it impacting the demand for your products? and maybe just a tack on to that, how are you looking at ways to potentially mitigate any negative impact on this transition over the medium and long-term?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
right. so, our view is, it's really more of a three-pronged approach. and firstly, oil and gas is still the cheapest form of energy that's going to help improve the lives of billion people around the world, that's just a reality. but there are things that we can do to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint. and that's why we rolled-out a marketing campaign for our e-series product just called green by design. the vxte tree for example eliminates 40 tons worth of hardware, that's 70 tons worth of co2 that doesn't go in the atmosphere just to make steel.
and then you have to look at the whole transportation manufacturing cycle, you don't have any carbon induced from that. but more importantly, when you go into the offshore spread, all of that e-series products working together saves about five days of installation time. so you think of all the vessels out there running diesel engines for propulsion and power and all that, you take five days of that carbon footprint out for our customers. and i believe -- i think we strongly believe going forward that carbon footprint is going to be another element on a bid review, just like price delivery, quality, reliability, it's going to be carbon footprint. so that's probably number 1 for us.
right now, there are things that we can do with our existing products that allow us to participate in geothermal and carbon capture or our carbon mitigation that's just within our existing product line. so we are doing that right now and participating in that right now. in the longer term, the strategic view is we're going to follow our customers and maybe look for new customers in that space. and we've recently dedicated resources really to focus on energy transition and what other opportunities there are or technologies that may be able for us to use and that really fit with our r&d prowess and strengths.
luke lemoine -- analyst
maybe we could just circle back to three-pronged approach, you just went over the geothermal and carbon capture, some of your products, you can point to that. could you just give us a few examples there?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
yeah, so there's a lot of carbon capture and sequestration that's talking about injecting, putting carbon into a slurry and then injecting that into an existing reservoir. so that's effectively like a water injection tree. there's some different materials and things that we have to do in that environment, but it's wholly like drilling a well and it's much like drilling the water injection well for water flood on a field development. and geothermal is really just more high temperature. it's a little bit lower pressure, but we've spent a lot of r&d energies and efforts in our hpht effort in singapore, so we have developed seals for high temperature environments and that's something that we can do. so that's pretty easy for us to flip into.
luke lemoine -- analyst
maybe on m&a side you've been exploring ways to consolidate through collaboration on subsea equipment supply. how does dril-quip view inorganic m&a or expansion of new products versus developing those capabilities in-house?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
raj, you want to take that?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, blake. so luke, we're always looking at technologies that accelerate our r&d roadmap. we lead with technology. i think you're well aware of that. but we've said before, we know that consolidation needs to take place in the industry. but right now, we're not just going to pursue consolidation just for consolidation's sake, right. we have a set of guidelines and we look at this from market share scale, what are the leverage levels and the free cash flow generation. so all of this are areas that we focus on when we look at any potential. i must admit, the bid ask spread is still wide. so we'll have to see how things develop over the course of this year and going into next year. but in terms of technology tuck-ins, that's sometimes -- that's something that we constantly review and it's active and ongoing.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay. turning to your balance sheet. so it's been a strength for dril-quip, how are you guys looking at the allocation of excess free cash flow and what scenarios or circumstances would you need to see considering resuming the repurchase of shares?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
so we are comfortable with the excess liquidity. we prefer a simple capital structure. it offers us maximum flexibility. and when i say that, if you think about the potential for a recovery going into latter half of this year and into early next year, given the project nature of business, there will be a timing build of working capital that we will need to fund. i talked earlier about the technology investments. this is both organic and inorganic. we will need cash to fund that. we also use our balance sheet as a strength when we go out to bid for work, right. we typically are the smaller player when it comes to bidding for work and we need to be able to show our customers that we have the wherewithal and we are going to be around and we have the balance sheet to support that.
if i go back to my earlier comment about a simple capital structure, with this sort of -- when i say simple, it's not complicated. there isn't any refinancing risk. we don't have debt or a convertible or any hybrid type of security that's on our balance sheet. and given the environment we're in right now, where liquidity and credit is challenged in this sector, we believe that having a balance sheet like ours is kind of like a fortress-strong balance sheet to help us drive our business forward.
luke lemoine -- analyst
so you've talked about your cash flow and working capital improvements and achieving that 5% free cash flow margin as far as revenue, you exceeded that in 1q with the working capital benefit. how are things progressing in these areas? and what's the outlook for these targets for 2021? and any challenges or risks in meeting this free cash flow margin?
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
so, luke, we're progressing to play. i'm very encouraged by q1 performance, right. we had close to $11 million of free cash flow. if i think about what we've done, we've been working on implementing our billing turnaround times. we are looking at milestone payments, we are pushing some of our inventory risks to our suppliers. and what we're basically doing, we're controlling what we can control on the -- of course, on the inventory side, this won't be immediate. we'll need to wait for the inventory to convert before we start seeing the working capital pick up.
when i think about challenges, in order to reduce inventory, we've made great efforts in looking at substitutions using current inventory to substitute for current sales. but at the end of the day, we need to have bookings to facilitate an inventory reduction. we are off to a good start, but we have to see this trend continue. while i say we've -- we've stepped up our efforts with collections from customers, we have seen in prior quarters where our customers have held their collections. and that's caused us to have a detrimental free cash flow number. i am encouraged that we've -- our interaction with our customers has picked up. we are in constant communication with them. and i think, especially with our larger customers, there's an appreciation that meeting payments to -- meeting payment obligations is something that's critical for us at dril-quip. and we saw good performance in q1 and i'm hopeful and i expect this trend to continue in 2021.
luke lemoine -- analyst
good. maybe if we could just kind of step back from a high-level view and look at how things are playing out in the four -- first four months of the year relative to your expectations for 2021, where are you seeing more opportunity? which areas do you think might be further behind in resuming activity? what factors do you think most contribute to seeing improvement across all geographies and customers in the back half of the year?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
so -- yeah, so, with respect to regional level activities, norway has been strong, there's been some governmental regulation there that's incentivizing exploration for oil and gas. so that's been strong. south america, latin america's strong. mexico is a bit uncertain because there's some dynamics there. but, certainly, in the caribbean, [indecipherable] and suriname and then brazil, we think is going to be strong. i think with the improved commodity price, i think we're going to see west africa pick up. i think asia will be strong on the gas side, down in australia. so that's a positive. and then a lot of the seas that are in countries that are not net exporters of oil and gas, that is strong, because they're developing their oil and gas reserves for internal consumption. and so their business continues. the gulf of mexico has been a little bit weak. i think that's something to do with uncertainty around the regulatory environment in the u.s. i hope that mitigates, that's certainly a world-class resource out there. but i like our position. we are not scrambling to figure out how we reduce the carbon footprint for our customers, which is becoming more and more important. this is something we've done as a business since its inception back in 1981, it was, how do we help our customers do things faster and safer and smarter. and by doing things faster and safer and less costly, we also have the benefit of reducing the carbon footprint. so i think we have the right suite of products that can help our customers. i'm incredibly excited about vxte. i think it's going to be game-changing. it's just so much simpler than what's been done in the past. and i think the outlook for dril-quip is positive once that demand for oil and gas starts recovering.
luke lemoine -- analyst
okay, good. well, we kind of breezed through all the questions i had. and i think you kind of hit a lot of the high points in that last question. but any closing remarks you wanted to make, blake?
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
really, just in closing, i just want to say to the employees of dril-quip, 2020 was tough. 2021, we're starting to see recovery. and i appreciate all the efforts of our employees globally. we're -- in the u.s., we're back into the office in mid-may. and i'm looking forward to that. so we will end the work from home there. and i think 2022, if the vaccines continue to roll out and the economy starts to open up, people start to travel, i think the future is looking pretty good for dril-quip.
luke lemoine -- analyst
good. blake and raj, really appreciate you all taking the time to chat about dril-quip and hope you all have a great weekend.
raj kumar -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, luke.
blake t. deberry -- chief executive officer
thank you, luke. i appreciate it.
luke lemoine -- analyst

2021-Q2,DRQ,2021-07-30 13:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to dril-quip second quarter 2021 fireside chat. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, mr. daniel burke. please go ahead.
daniel burke -- analyst
yes, good morning. want to welcome everyone joining our dril-quip discussion via the phone or webcast and i'm happy to introduce dril-quip management ceo, blake deberry; and cfo, raj kumar. welcome, guys and thanks for the opportunity to host this conversation. i want to plunge right in and start with some questions on the second quarter results you guys just released yesterday evening. but before i jump right in, let me hand the floor over to you, blake, and ask you to highlight any key themes you want to make sure we emphasize here before delving into the specifics.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
sure, daniel. i think the main thing is we've laid out several pillars of strategy that we believe will help the company to be successful in the future and we're getting success on all those strategic initiatives. we've outlined our peer-to-peer strategy, which is really a consolidation by collaboration and we did during the quarter signed our first peer-to-peer agreement, actually our second, if you include the agreement. our downhole tool business, which we've been focused on pretty intently to get improvement in that business, is gaining significantly more traction and that business is doing very well. so, we're very pleased with that.
further, we spent a lot of time, energy, and effort on new products and we are starting to see now new product adoptions. we had several of those in the quarter, run a lot of serial number ones, which is the most difficult thing to do is get somebody to try it the first time and that generally lend itself to adoption of that product. so, we've had success there. lastly, we identified of $10 million productivity gain for 2021 and we're well on our way to meeting that productivity gains. so, on balance strategically the things that we're trying to do, we're having success within the quarter.
",":
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, i appreciate that, blake. thanks. let me let me go ahead then and start with a couple of questions. really catalyzed by the q2 release. let's start with one that's a bit high level. you included a handful of updates on your 2021 targets a little bit of an update on year-over-year revenue trend, order outlook, and free cash flow target margin, maybe i thought it would be a worthwhile if you guys could take a second and highlight those updates.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
sure. on the revenue side, we originally forecast 2021 to be similar to 2020. i think we've guided that down just slightly, so our revenue was down a little bit on the quarter, but that really is just a result of the lower bookings that we had in the back half of 2020, starting to manifest themselves in the top line. that's just really it. as our booking level increase, which we're hopeful for in the back half of the year here, we should see improvement in the revenue and things turning around. on the booking side, we had a pretty good bookings quarter right down the fairway of our range of $40 to $60 million. but if you just compare q1 that q2 on base bookings. so, in q1 we booked like $57.58 million, but we had a $20 million booking in there for subsea trees and control systems. so, the net bookings really kind of a $37 million just ropes opened baseline bookings in q1 and q2. there was no large one-time. so, we booked $50 million in q2 and it's a significant improvement quarter-on-quarter and bookings. so, i'm pleased about that and happy to take more questions on bookings and how we see going forward.
on free cash flow, we had a pretty good free cash flow quarter. we're trending significantly better than expected and i think we will exceed our target by year end for sure in that area.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. thanks. that's a helpful rundown, blake. so, let's stay with as you mentioned quarters, you mentioned an expectation that the q4 2021 orders in particular will be strong. can you talk about the visibility you have into what's giving you that conviction and is there any timing element to watch out for where we could see a dip in orders in q3 before correspondingly strong rebound in q4?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
yes, sure. so, first, on the visibility we have, some of it is qualitative some of it is quantitative. i mean some things we can put our hands on heart and say, yes, that's something new in order book and then some of it is just more qualitative, what you're seeing in the environment. but specifically, when we look at our crm, we see more opportunities coming up, particularly q4 and into 2022 and we're starting to see some, what i call availability place with some of our independent customers, hey, i'm going to go drill a well. do you have something in inventory that we could take now. so those opportunities are starting to appear and be quite candid, if i look at our markets, just on a segmented regional basis, there is more areas where there's upside and increased activity, there are down or neutral and that's different than what we've seen in the past.
looking forward, our bookings on q3, i think we're going to see q3 similar to q2 and again in the mid of that 40 to 60 range and then q4 is where we hope to see some momentum in our bookings and then that continue on into 2022.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, helpful. then again just to lean on 2022 for a moment, any reason you think you'll crack out of that $40 to $60 million per quarter type of range you've been at really since the onset of the covid times?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
yes. we expect q4 to end it. right now, we're just saying, we think we're going to be at the top end of that 40 to 60 million range on bookings on quarter. right now, 2021 is looking optimistic. i'm not ready to call a number, but i think our q4 number would be a consistent jump off point. we're just seeing a lot of improvement in the market. i think you're seeing even the rig contractors making commentary that they get more activity on leasing the rigs and i think transocean recently came out and said that all the rigs in the gulf are going to be mostly subscribed and under contract by the end of the year. so that bodes well for us.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. i also wanted to talk about margins. q2 product margins did dip about 400 basis points sequentially. you mentioned mix is a reason, but harkening back to last quarter, you mentioned margins in the back half of the year likely to firm up on improving mix and your cost out programs. i guess i want to do firm that's still the case and you expect to claw back some ground on the margin line.
raj kumar -- vice president & chief financial officer
so, daniel, margins in q2, we talked about the af global impact to margins. about a year and a half ago, we leased our operations to our af global and as part of that, we accounted for leasing revenue that we had to accrue for. some of this leasing revenue was forward in nature that we accrued for and that impact had, the fact that they terminated the lease, had an impact on our margins because it impact of our cost of goods sold. i'll consider that to be around 300 basis points of impact in q2. we also had some mix issues in q2, but when i say mix issues, actually is a good story here. we saw pipe and connector mix go up and that's always a leading indicator for us. what it means is customers are going back to work. they're getting the pipe and connectors ordered. they're going to run down the wellhead inventory and soon, they're going to see those wellhead inventories have to be replenished and that's going to help us with our mix going forward. if you think about that and if i were to look out second half of this year, i should see mixed up to improve in q3 and firm up in q4. we've had some very good results of our downhole tools outsourcing. we are seeing very positive results and expect that to continue. there may be some headwinds with our project mix in terms of we are doing a lot of controls work with proserv and evidently, we have margin sharing situation there that could be a headwind to our mix. but overall, as i look into q3 and q4, i see stabilization in q3, firming up in q4. if i were to guide you in terms of ebitda, i would say that on a normalized basis, our ebitda should be in the high teens going forward.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. a recurring theme this earning season has been input cost pressures and how well companies can manage them. one of the more interesting elements of your release with the disclosure that you will impose a 10% surcharge on orders and essentially an effort to be proactive here with the potential for rising costs, can you just talk about how that has been received by customers and how easy you think that's going to be to implement?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
daniel, i think, our customers are understanding of this cost increase. we're not pushing because its demand based. they're seeing the same cost pressures themselves. while nobody likes a price increase, it's just the reality that transportation and materials are going up and that's putting pressure on our margin and cost base. i recall back in 2003 and 2004 and again in 2006 and 2007, we saw the same kind of price increase on raw materials and our customers may not like it, they accept that that's the reality of what's going on in the market. so, i don't expect too much pushback in that regard.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay. maybe a more basic element of the question and what do you see it in terms of steel pricing, raw material pricing, and freight? what exposure, if any, do you have now against your existing backlog?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
so, right now, as we look at our backlog in the transportation and the material element in there, there's really about a blended 10% increase. that's really why we're pushing that number out there. the fortunate thing for us is that our business is longer cycle in nature. so, we have the ability to plan ahead. our supply chain organization that we stood up in 2019 has done a really great job of securing long-term contracts. right now, even though transportation rates, container freight rates are up as high as $9,000 to $10,000 a container, we still have contracts where we're paying $3000 to $4,000 a container coming to or from asia, for example. but those contracts have an end and so that's why we're pushing surcharge through, because we have to cover those additional expenses as they come through.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it, ok. then, raj, you mentioned earlier the impact of the cancellation of the forge lease with af global on the q2 results. but thinking about that strategically, now that they've cancel the lease, what are your options for sourcing and what are your plans forge itself?
raj kumar -- vice president & chief financial officer
right now, the immediate step is to as blake talked about our supply chain organization and they have been very successful in ensuring that we have forge supplies, the ability to get forge supplies from multiple suppliers. so, we've kind of mitigated that risk completely. global, prior to this, they were supporting us only from a domestic perspective and we were very quickly been able to pivot and get other sources of supply. so, we're not too concerned about that. from a warm stacking perspective, the cost of doing that is negligible. it's not going to be anywhere close to the $11 to $13 million we saw when we were operating the forge back in today. this will be maybe $100,000 a month. we are actually having conversations with a number of forge operators right now. some are looking to lease, some are looking to buy. those conversations are proceeding and i'm confident that we should get to some closure on this issue with the forge by the end of the year.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. raj, just to stay with you for one moment. i wanted to revisit a comment you made just a few moments ago, we were talking about margins. you talked about normalized high teens ebitda margins going forward. i just wanted to get a little incremental clarity there. are you talking about adjusted companywide ebitda margins in the high teens once things normalize, which will mean get out of the g&a burden you've had related to litigation and again some of global stuff?
raj kumar -- vice president & chief financial officer
that's absolutely right, daniel. when i'm talking about normalized, i mean, once we get back to steady state and we know a steady state right now and also blake earlier comments, the lower order is coming to roost right now. for us, when we start talking normalizes back, when we are back to activity levels that we saw maybe 3 to 4 years ago. once we get to that level, i should expect us to be in the mid to high teens. the litigation side, yes, that's been a headwind this year for us, but we're putting that behind us. we could have some additional cost, but nowhere near where we've been and what we've experienced over the past year. in that sort of perspective, i would expect very easily once we get to normalize, we should be trending up to the mid and going up to the high teens in terms of ebitda.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful context. to be clear, it's kind of cleaning up some of the specials as well as getting back up to maybe a more robust topline than you're experiencing this year. an element of that margin progression is also on the cost savings that you guys have implemented includes $10 million this year and frankly, looking at the q2 update, you're well on your way to that $10 million. are there any scenarios you could envision that would result in further changes to the cost structure for the company?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
so, daniel, it's in our dna to constantly evaluate our cost structure. the past 3 years, i think you've seen and what you're calling structural costs, what we call transformational cost. we call it transformational because what we're looking to do is leverage every dollar cost that we have. being more efficient in the way we look at $1 spent and if you look at where we are right now and the outlook that we have in terms of bookings, i think we're in a very strong position, a very good position to get a lot of operating leverage in this recovery. we always had the view when the recovery comes back that we need to be ready to do it and be able to flex our manufacturing and we are in that position right now.
obviously, we'll have to pull on overtime to get the first 20% to 30% of output. once we get some stability in terms of activity levels, we will probably have to look at adding some variable cost to maintain the level of activity that we are anticipating going into next year, but for now, where we sit, we are focused on the productivity improvements. blake talked about the fact that we're well underway. we had a $10 million target out there. we have exceeded the run rate. we are close to $8 million right now in terms of our productivity savings and any additional structural changes or transformational changes will have to be evaluated against the market context. but as of now, what we're seeing is, i think, we are poised and well positioned to take advantage of the recovery.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. let me pivot and just ask a couple of questions on really the commercial side of the business. we start with something you mentioned previously, blake, in your opening comments. your consolidation via collaboration strategy. you mentioned the agreement you signed with integrated oil services peer for wellheads and related equipment. that sounds like it could be significant. is there any way you can frame up or provide some incremental color on the size of the opportunity and maybe timeline to first sales under the agreement?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
certainly. i'm really pleased with our team reaching an agreement. the agreement we signed is with one subsea and it is for the provision of wellheads and liner hangers and tubular goods, so pipe and connectors. so, it's pretty significant. the teams are just now starting to work together and comparing opportunities and i guess the way to frame it daniel, is to the extent that one subsea is successful than dril-quip is going to be successful. they're going to give us access to markets that we previously didn't play in, particularly the integrated developments, and i think we're likely to have some success by the end of this year or early next year. i mean i think there is one opportunity that comes up end of this year. then there are several out in the future, but i think it's going to be meaningful to our wellhead business, that's for sure.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. then on the e-series technologies, you've had some booking success vxte, big bore iie and i think you mentioned the dxc connector in the press release yesterday afternoon. just generally, highlight some of the successes you've seen initially and maybe highlight as well more specifically vxte, you're thinking on timeline there for, as mentioned in the press release, first project or product deployment and opportunities beyond that point.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
it's been a good quarter for new products. it's one of the things i'm extremely pleased about. we just signed a multi-year contract with the major brazilian noc. i think that's pretty clear what that is and this is x pack te liner hanger system. so, this is an arrangement even turnkey suppliers like schlumberger and halliburton will be coming to us to get the x pack te for use by this operator. that's a big, big win on the x pack te. big bore iie, i think we announced last quarter, we ran our first big bore iie and ran the second one this quarter but we are now seeing that that same noc in brazil is looking very closely at big bore iie in the current tender that's out and we're optimistic, but we don't have a contract yet but they're starting to realize the time savings has real value and it's meaningful to their cost structure and same thing with big bore iie, we've got to iocs that are looking to standardize on it and we're consolidating our wellheads from 15 different [indecipherable] big bore iie is a big part of that and so i think that's a great start.
another one, the dxe wellhead connector, this one is a little more subtle to understand, but the top of the wellhead has a profile on there. that's traditional de facto standard profile has been in h4 profile for over 20, years longer than that probably and the dxc connector is a different profile in the wellhead and it has very high fatigue resistance. when you have large rigs and shallow water, like to have in norway, the time the rig to stay on the well was very, very short because of fatigue and the dxc connector including the profile in the wellhead is extended by an order of magnitude the amount of time on the road. it's a significant adoption because it's not just somebody bought a product, but they decided to change a de facto standard of the interface of a wellhead to the bop stack. so that's a big deal. specifically, to vxte, we do have another opportunity to run the vxte with walter oil and gas. they are spudding the wells on april 1. walter buys these trees and put them in inventory and when they drill a prospect if it is suitable for subsea development required to treat and they just go right ahead and run the competition and run the tree. so, every time they drill well, we've done up to run that; so i'm hopeful that that they are successful on as well and we will get that tree run just at the end of this year, early next year. how that number one behind us?
that said, we had a lot of pressure during the lawsuit. we had several major step back for vxte over the lawsuit, which resolved. we are reengaging with [phonetic] come back, they are fully on board. i think we're getting back on track with our vxte marketing strategy. it is a meaningful product from a time cost and carbon footprint standpoint.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. well, again staying on the commercial side, blake. let me pivot over to downhole tools. obviously, the business had a really strong q1 and it had a pretty good q2 as well. so, your comp in revenue up about 30% year-over-year, year-to-date and then you've touched on these before, but help me better understand the drivers. is any portion of this catch-up related to disrupted 2020? what portion is structural? i know you've made some changes to the business, but help me understand that. help me understand as well whether you can kind of sustain this higher revenue run rate looking into the second half of the year?
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
yes, so there is a little bit of catch-up from 2020. but that's a very small part of it. it's really more about the changes we've made to the operating model of this business. we did bring in new leadership for the downhole tools group, but not only that, over his time with dril-quip, we've also changed the leadership in several regions where we operate. we have an increase in our geographic focus and we also have some new technology. the other thing we did is we looked at what are the areas where we are underperforming. we closed some businesses and left some areas because it was a distraction. we said we're going to focus on these key areas, which is really middle east, latin america, and our offshore business. that we've done. we've improved our supply chain with better stocking programs and quite honestly, lower costs, so improved margins there. so, we're much more competitive now and downhole tools specifically line hangers, it's a business that you sell from inventory. if you don't have the inventory, you don't get the business. so, we've built that inventory up and we're being much more competitive than it and we are continuing.
we are maniacally focused right now on our service quality. we've got initiatives in place to improve our service quality and so that's helped to help grow that business. we're also seeing more peer-to-peer activity. we've always provided liner hangers to peer, but that seems to be increasing over the course of the year and those things are just structural and those things just continue on.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. then, also again, on sort of the commercial front; you guys have fielded a number of energy transition questions over the last few calls, but it does remain your main topic, so let me add one and more the straightforward one. when you look at your green-by-design campaign and the message you tried to convey to customers, what's the reception been like there.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
so green-by-design is a campaign we put together that really ties together our r&d focus for all the new products we developed. i think i've talked about this before. i challenged our engineers with the concept of i want you to develop equipment that structurally changes how our customers drill wells to provide them permanent cost savings. the way you can do that is i can eliminate things that i have to install. i can reduce the time, so i reduced steel and i reduced time. as the focus shifted more to carbon footprint environment, what we realized was saving time in an offshore spread has a significant impact on carbon footprint. that really kind of changed the way we think about r&d, that time is really important because it's important both from an irr perspective and return on the investment, but also from a carbon perspective because the number of vessels working offshore are significant. it really just represents a significant change in how we think about designing and r&d products and just to kind of put a finer point on it, we started doing what's the carbon footprint savings of installing of the vxte tree and these are preliminary numbers, because we haven't added everything.
i'm going to give you a number here that's probably conservative to the low side, but vxte about 1,000 metric tons of carbon saved per well and that's in addition to the five days and $5 million of cost; so it's pretty meaningful for our customers.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. all right. you've also mentioned, blake, that the dril-quip has some ability to kind of step out into the marketplace around carbon capture and geothermal and you described some of those opportunities or adjacencies. but any actual commercial opportunities emerge that are on the horizon.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
yes. so, our plan is to be an active player in the energy transition and carbon capture and geothermal are certainly things that are adjacent to what we already do. we have bid a couple of carbon capture projects. we have not been successful. we got a big one coming up next year that we're really focused on. every time you bid these things you understand more what the requirements are. and i think we're going to be successful here. we're spending a little bit r&d money to do some development work that fine-tunes our tree systems to meet the requirements of carbon capture. but this is an area where we're going to become more strategic whereas the past which is kind of adhoc opportunities is an area where we now focus on and our sales guys really go out and look for, people for customers that are, that are plan in these geothermal rcc us projects.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay. and i wanted to give it back to sort of free cash margin targets and raj, you might have given the a bit of a hint with your comment on our normalized ebitda margins for the company being mid high teens and an ambition, we won't see this year, but a relevant sort of data points so, but building from that. could you share some thoughts on where free cash flow margin could be or could trend over the intermediate term.
raj kumar -- vice president & chief financial officer
absolutely. so, daniel. you know we guided at the beginning of the year, we said that we would expect a free cash flow margin to be 5% and what i used to work. free cash flow margin, and i'm using the margin on revenue, just to be clear on that. if you look at how we've been with the progress we've made year-to-date. we will exceed that target in 2021. in fact, i'm confident that we'll get very close to double of that targets of close to 10% by 2020, by the end of 2021 and my only caution is as we approach next year and the back half of this year going into next year, we're starting to see orders come in, market starting to recover, backlog starting to build. i expect that we could see some headwinds and these to be a good headwinds to working capital, right. but i expect this to be transitionary maybe a slight dip next year and then we should get back to that 10% yield very quickly. if you go back to my comment on the ebitda, it's very you can very quickly see you have a capex impact. you've got some cash taxes in there and you very, very easily land at that ten plus yield on a normalized basis.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. and raj, you referring to some of the elements of working capital influencing free cash and so maybe to follow-up there, looks like you guys have made pretty good progress this year on the ar side and the ap side but inventory levels still seems a bit elevated, what can you do. and is there the ability to see improvement there in the face of or in the face of anticipating a rising order trend.
raj kumar -- vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so that's a good point, daniel. let me talk about working capital, right. so, on the ar side, let me talk about the progress we've made on the ar and the ap side. on the ar side, a lot of process improvements initially rolled out domestically in the us and then we went into the regions and did a lot of process improvements in terms of invoicing, turnaround, collections efforts coordination with the customer meeting payment terms, et cetera. and that's, that's coming to bear fruit for us. i mean this is something we worked on last year and we're seeing the results of that come into play now. on the ap side, we've done a lot with our supply chain group that we recently stood up, we've done a lot of vendor management et cetera. in terms of payment terms and that's helped us deeper relationships with fewer vendors is going to allow us to have better terms basically.
now, shifting to inventory. yes, it is a problem, we've highlighted maniacally focused on it. we've done a lot of substitution efforts this year, we've looked at consignment with some of our vendors to help us on the inventory side but these are all you can only do so much, right at the end of the day, we need the booking to come in. the bookings need to come in for us to turn the inventory, so if i look out second half going into next year as bookings start to improve, we should start turning inventory at a faster clip rate and that too is going to help us in terms of adding to the working capital wind down.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, got it. and then, i think that kind of leads us as well too another popular question on the balance sheet, which will and a little bit of a recurrent question here, but you have $270 million in cash after a couple of quarters of free cash flow. what are the latest thoughts on capital allocation and our or m&a opportunities, are they reseating or do they grow as your marketplace transitions to a recovery scenario.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
so first, the way we look at cash and the way we run our business is very, very return on invested capital focus, is very roic focused. i think you can see that, the examples i can talk about our one the florence, right, we, it was basically a capital allocation by discussion where you think about the forge, as leasing it to have global understand, there's been a termination, but we're looking to now path-fire passway [phonetic] that's going to help us in terms of from an roic perspective. another example i can talk to is like the control's fees collaborating with proserv, these are areas where it leverages our roic and increases our leverage on the business. so, coming to your question on the m&a opportunities, there are m&a opportunities, no doubt about it. there are consolidation opportunities, the problem we are still having is, that bit out spread continues to be wide.
we also find some of the targets balance sheets to be constrained making a deal not possible for us. we've always said that we are not going to do a deal just for the sake of doing a deal, it's got to make sense for us, it's got to makes sense for us strategically, operationally and financially. and right now, i think -- i expect that over the course of the year. sentiments may change and people may get a bit more reasonable in terms of what valuation should be and we continue to monitor what's going on in the marketplace. one aspect that we've sort of shifted our focus to is, we started to look at energy transition opportunities, looking at areas where we can leapfrog our participation in this area, especially it relates to carbon capture and geothermal because we see ourselves very well positioned with our product suite to target that market and be very successful in that area.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
okay, got it. and then, maybe is close to a final question come back up to a high level, the challenges for you and peers are that the end markets are growing, are poised for growth. but peak industry equity levels are far way off maybe unlikely to recur, you've done a lot to take cost out of dril-quip. could you sum up maybe for me, blake. the initiatives that are most important to you guys as you look at ways to grow top line and admittedly, we've touched on a number of these throughout the course of the conversation, but i think if you would be helpful to kind of to go back through would recite them.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
certainly. first of all, let's say, let's set the stage. i think our expectation is that our customers are going to be a little more conservative with large orders, we're not going to see the, i recall back the $80 million booking from petrobras which was right before downturn which they ultimately didn't fall through on. i just don't think those are going to happen anymore. i think it's going to be a much more hollow [phonetic] type environment, where you have a contract and we're going to order general and wellheads and book the column off over this time period. and so, so the market has changed admit it, but we believe, and i believe with our strategic growth pillars are going to help us outpaced that market. the peer to peer gives us access to market and opportunities that previously we just couldn't win and we just didn't have access to and into to put a little bit of finer point on that, the little bit of work we've done so far and it almost doubles our at-bats, if you want to use of basic terminology of opportunities, right.
and so our downhole tools business is on track to get back toward its previous peak levels you know when we acquired tiw and when 17 their peak revenue was about $140 million and we could atleast see half the growth that business where it's heading up in that way or in the next few years, all the new products that we've worked on are starting to get installed and adopted. we're getting a lot more traction in the more that we run, the more activity, we get from different customers wanting to take advantage of the savings as well as the carbon footprint reduction and we've got the company position now where we can on the backlog. and we got a track record of keeping our costs low. so, i think we're going to see our margin profile and improve, and you put all that together, we're probably one of the few people that could say, hey, the market can remain flat. but we're going to gain share through all of these peers and the top line is going to grow.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
got it. well, i think that was, that was a good summation blake and that does conclude my questions. again, i think, i think that was a good finishing off point but blake there any last messages or thoughts you'd like to share.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
i just say that we're really optimistic about 2020 probably how we were optimistic in 19 going into 20. but i think the pandemic is, i think there should be some bumps in the road has come back, i think on balance things are returning back to normal. and i think that's going to be good for our business, we've got everything lined up to be very successful going forward and i'm encouraged what 2022 to has to bring for dril-quip, its employees and its shareholders.
daniel burke -- johnson rice & company -- analyst
that's great. thank you. thank you, blake. thank you, raj. i think that will conclude our discussion, then and hope everybody does have a nice weekend.
blake deberry -- chief executive officer & director
thank you.

2021-Q3,DRQ,2021-10-29 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the dril-quip q3 2021 a fireside chat conference call. i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. james west with evercore isi. the floor is yours.
james west -- analyst
thanks. in the. good morning, everyone. welcome to this morning's fireside chat with dril-quip's management team. as mentioned, i'm james west from evercore isi. i'm joined today with blake deberry, the company's president and ceo and blake's soon to be successor jeff bird who will take over as president and ceo at the turn of the year. perhaps before we get started, i'd like to say a few words about blake and jeff. i began covering dril-quip in the early 2000s when the company's three founders shared the titles of co-chairman and co-ceos and while larry, gary and mike did an excellent job building dril-quip into the highly successful company it is today it was during blake's tenure as a ceo when his successful transition from a founder-led start-up to a modernized global leader really unfolded.
blake's tenure has been impressive, he was further augmented when jeff joined the company in 2017. and together, these two gentlemen have further strengthened the company and successfully navigated one of the most challenging periods in the modern oilfield. so i'm very confident of blake is leaving the company in good hands with jeff as its leader. perhaps, to start off here though, i do want to blake to say a few words, maybe give a brief recap of the third quarter, and some opening comments.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, james, and thanks for covering dril-quip throughout my tenure, and from the 2000, so 20 years or so have covered. and i agree with you, i think the company has been in good hand -- is going to be in good hands with jeff, as i depart, and look forward to seeing how the company progresses as we go forward. with respect to the third quarter, the bookings came in at the lower end of our $40 million to $60 million range, which is, it's still within the range that we expected, but on the lower side, and revenue was pretty much in line, but our ebitda was impacted by some one-time items and some margin pressure.
on the positive side, our downhole tools group again had a really strong quarter, set another high for that business since its acquisition in 2016. so that's a positive that business continues to grow and accelerate. we had another good quarter with respect to free cash flow, which has been a big focus for the management team of dril-quip this year. kind of looking forward, we saw improvement quarter-over-quarter in our aftermarket and our leasing revenues and this is always a good indicator of a pickup in activity impending pickup in activity, as our customers are getting back to work and consuming their inventory.
additionally, we've had good conversations with customers that are trending more positively of activity levels. so we're seeing that happen. and just looking at the market, particularly the offshore rig market we're hearing more and more positive signs about quotation activity for rigs, number of quotes for rigs offshore rigs, as well as the duration of the request for the contract. so those are all positive indicators of an improving market.
",":
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
so, maybe i'll turn it over to jeff for a second here. as i think all of us know with any transition, as soon as you announced that even though blake may not be still in the room. everybody starts hanging out jeff's office more than blake's office so you are the man leading the charge here. commodity prices have seen a good strength this year such as past several quarters, but all reason they are all not experiencing the same conditions and recovering economically where what it is already seen or maintain growth activity and particularly when do you think we'll see growth improvements in the gulf of mexico.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so thanks james just walking around the world. if we think about gulf of mexico, we are starting to see signs of recovery there. specifically, the independents that are more susceptible or more responsive to higher commodity prices are starting to come back to the market. we're optimistic about that. if we go around the rest of the world and just talk subsea brazil is definitely back. we've talked a little bit about the 11 wellhead exploration tender that we received last quarter 26 liner hangers that we received last quarter as well, so that's definitely coming back. there is also a tender that's out there right now on the development wellheads. we expect, we're optimistic about that. we expect that to be awarded sometime in the fourth quarter as well. so definitely brazil is back.
if we look at offshore u.k. it's a return. it's not at 19 levels yet, but it's definitely returned. norway is very strong right now a lot of government incentives there, so, we're optimistic about that. china also on is hot, and we're looking at a tender either late this year, early next year as well. on the areas that are slower at malaysia, indonesia, india, australia also, and those are mainly covid-related to be honest, we've just seen the activity really curtail there. and then, probably further in the distance we are starting to see some of the large greenfield developments and africa, starting to have conversations, again.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, makes sense. and do you think that your capital discipline working capital management, is going to play a role in, kind of how customers think about ordering activity?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so if we think about that obviously in the lower 48 home rider case. so we've got almost no exposure in the lower 48. so that's not really impacting us. as we have conversations with customers, though we do see a lot of customers really reloading their balance sheet in the fourth quarter and probably the first half of next year where they're going to take advantage of those higher commodity prices to reload balance sheets before they start ordering again in the back half of the year. so as a result, we believe that the iocs are more back-end loaded in some of our customers are more back-end loaded next year primarily because of capital discipline and kind of reloading their balance sheets
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and are you seeing any change in behavior, as we think about kind of energy transition, is there a hesitancy to sanction larger projects at this point?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think there is certainly a little bit more caution around the larger projects than there might have been in the past. so it's going to be more brownfield tieback type projects. we are starting to see some of the large greenfield projects that i mentioned.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. you mentioned.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
but it's going to be more brownfield tie-back. we're starting to see, as it relates to energy transition more robust comments in the tenders and more request in the tenders specifically around carbon footprint, specifically around what we can do to help customers reduce their carbon footprint. in fact, i think we got a tender last quarter that was probably the most robust. as it relates to that, we'll be curious to see how that factors into the tendering process its not exactly clear right now, other than a very robust list of of questions and requests.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure. okay. well, i do want to come back to that tender and the carbon. but maybe to touch on at least kind of where we are and as we're doing today orders seem to be kind of paying out $40 million to $60 million range. what do you think you need to see to have orders break outside of that range? and do you think this happens since late q4 and does it redo?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so if we think about it, we -- we've been quoting $40 million to $60 million. we believe, we'll be at the high end of that range in q4 that q4 range is largely dependent on how the independents come in, and right now, we've got a lot of nice projects around those independents coming in and that would dictate whether we're at the high end of the range or actually even exceed the high-end of that range in the fourth quarter. if we look out to next year, and 2022 right now, it's early days and we see a lot of our customers in the middle of their planning project right now. so, we met with the customer. i think earlier this week action when we met with that customer earlier this week they were actually even surprised at the amount of activity within their own company gone around their budgeting process. so i think those customers are still in a state of flux, but early days right now, we see '22, up 20% to 25% on '21 from a booking standpoint. and this year we expect the book a trees next year, we would expect double the number of trees that we've booked in this year. so we're definitely optimistic about next year. i do think it's going to be choppy. as we come out.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure. okay, makes sense. and are there any large projects you're tracking or have an update on?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. there's really two. there is there is the petrobras development tender that we're talking about.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
where we believe we're well positioned for that, and we're pretty optimistic about that. we think that will be awarded in the fourth quarter. and then the other one is actually with sea. and that one is actually a collaboration agreement and that would be our first large collaboration tender and that we expect that either fourth quarter of this year or first quarter next year.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
i mean when you say collaboration. what do you?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
that's the one subsea collaboration. so in the case, there we're actually going in with one subsea. we provide the wellhead, they provide a lot of the other kit.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, great. makes sense. so a lot of your focus, firstly, jeff, since you got involved in the business you've been taking all the cost out and running the operations more efficiently. are there any actions or are the actions you took last year playing out the way you expected now? and what scenarios could arise that would cause you to consider further changes to the cost structure.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so i think everything is playing out, as we expect that. we've gotten the cost out of business. we're actually a little ahead, this year and what our productivity projects are. if you remember back to the transformation, when we positioned that we set at $400 million of revenue we do $40 million to $50 million of ebitda. who knew at the time we thought that would be the trough revenue. obviously, we didn't expect the pandemic so the trough revenue is a little lower than we thought. so it's -- i think it's unquestionable right now that we're holding more cost, than we need to hold in anticipation of a recovery.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
this spot we don't want to be in, to be honest is, cut a bunch of costs this quarter and find out next quarter or two quarters from now that a recovery is underway, and we just add a bunch of that costs rack. so we estimate that we're probably holding $20 million to $30 million of excess cost right now, as a result of where we are right now in the cycle.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
we'll continue to monitor to that by the way into your specific question on what triggers. we're looking at a $40 million to $60 million range. i think if we start to see orders at the low end of that range or even the mid-end of that -- mid-part of that range, we'll have to react accordingly from a cost standpoint. we know what the triggers are we need to pull. we're just trying to be thoughtful about it.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. okay. and there's been a lot of conversation in the media certainly, and among investors about rising materials and rising the freight prices. what are you seeing on that side in terms of impacts to your business? and how are you trying to mitigate some of those impacts?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
so let me divide the business between downhole tools, and subsea. on the downhole tools side, and that is a short cycle business. so those are 12-week lead times. so in those cases, we see the impact much quicker. and we have to pass on the price much quicker around that. so, we've immediately gone out with price increases around the downhole tool business, and we've been largely successful around that. on the subsea side because those lead times can be anywhere from 26 to 52 to 18 months, we've got a lot longer runway around that. so, largely what we see there is, we will see the increases we are passing along a 10% price increase on the subsea side. and largely, we believe we'll be successful on that subsea side as well.
so we don't really see that inflation impact that you'd expect to see short in a short time horizon. freight is a little different story. and freights an odd story in that we're seeing two problems with freight. one is obviously, just the escalation in freight prices alone, but it's also availability of routes and modes, if you will. so we find ourselves in some situations where we might normally go oceans somewhere. we can get the ocean, and we end up airfreighting something out because we can't. our customer needs it, the ocean modes not available and we end up airfreighting. and so, we do have inflation, as it relates to freight, and in some cases that inflation is just a result of having use a more expensive mode than we might normally use as well.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. okay. i want to go back to the collaboration, part that you mentioned that the project with one subsea as you're working on in the sea. historically i'd say probably before your arrival, jeff, the collaboration was a big part of dril-quip's business. i still remember spending time with gary and larry and those guys and they always figure they can just do it better. and then they did to their credit. but you've putting some collaboration efforts. what's the impact have that's had on the business thus far? and what's your future expectations?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so we've really got two major collaboration agreements that we have announced one is proserv and that's where proserv is providing the controls for us and we did that largely because candidly were holding excess cost and found ourselves in a position where we're going to have to invest a considerable amount of money to get our controls up to the right level. the benefit there really if you look back at the bhp norskan award, that happened earlier in the year. that was a direct result of that proserv collaboration agreement. and if you look out over the next 18 months we know there's going to be at least a few more trees that will come out of that bhp award and that's going to be a direct result of the proserv collaboration. so we believe that's working and that's just one example of how that's working.
the downside of that is, is that there is some pass through impact of that obviously so those controls pass-through at a lower margin than you might normally expect. just have to keep that in mind, and it depends largely by the way on how the customer wants to contract. bhp is a good example where they said we will one contract one butt to kick so to speak, so we end up passing through bhp. other customers don't care and will contract separately and that will make the margin lose a little bit better, but understand that one subsea collaboration we signed recently as well. that's around wellheads and it's essentially we sit down every month and go through what are the joint opportunities out there, and we bid jointly with one subsea in many cases. so, the cnooc is a good example we've bid with them.
there are opportunities where we bid with them and bid separately, as well and that's part of the collaboration. it's taken a little while to take off just because of the bid cycle 26 to 52 week lead times on wellheads. it doesn't happen immediately, so this one and fourth quarter will likely be the first opportunity that we could see a win.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
fourth quarter of this year, first quarter next year.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
and are you guys thinking about imagining, exploring other product line and collaboration partners?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so i think there is really two or three other opportunities there. one is on the downhole tool side, specifically around liner hangers. and liner hangers is part of that one subsea collaboration agreement. that's a little bit behind where the wellheads are right now, but we're starting to gain traction that we already sell through schlumberger, but we're starting to gain more traction there as well. if you think about it in terms of the vxte which is another opportunity, we would expect to work with other tree manufacturers to provide vxte through those other tree manufacturers. and then the last opportunity is really around energy transition. and we've got a nice offering on shallow water trees and in many cases there is a lot of large -- much larger enterprises going after large carbon capture, and storage projects that don't have good shallow water tree. so we're in conversations with those partners as well.
so, those are the next two opportunities probably vxte and something around ccus specifically shallow water trees.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. that's great, great to hear. i did speak to the drill on rent, so your downhole tool business recently another record quarter in the third quarter. so what do you, what's happening? and what's driving these improvements of the business? how are you making progress to drive growth in key markets? and what are the longer term goals and targets this business could do?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
so we brought, steven. in the last 18 months, 24 months and we brought him in candidly. he looked at where we were playing everywhere in the world around downhole tools and there is a couple of reasons that we just decided we can't compete in those regions we'll never make money in those regions. we exited those on the regions or end specifically around middle east specifically around latin america specifically around deepwater. we're very focused on those we've brought new general managers in, in each of those regions. and then in addition to that we've put stocking programs in place in each of those regions. so we've got specific skus that we've got in those regions that allows us to respond quickly to our customers. we've made some inventories -- inventory investments i think around $6 million in inventory investment this year, but it's going to allow us to be up 30% year-on-year. in revenue on downhole tools, we expect to be up another 30% again next year year-on-year in downhole tools, and we would see ourselves getting to a $100 million to $120 million in downhole tools, not $22 million necessarily, but think about that as $23 million and beyond. i mean i think that $100 millions with insight just in the geographies we're in just of the skus we've got, i think that next piece after that is going to take getting into some different geographies and thinking about some different skus.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, it makes makes lot of sense. let's talk a little bit the e-series family of technologies, because they are beginning to see some success in bookings and installations. and can you maybe talk about which products we're seeing success? and also maybe an update to on the vxte post-trial verdict and how the conversation has changed?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
let's. i'll start with, i'll start with more and on big bore iie. and on big bore iie, which is our wellhead we've seen wild success in that, to be honest. in fact, we would expect by the end of next year for 60% to 70% of all the incoming orders that we're getting to be big bore iie. so there has been wide acceptance of that product. and that's great for a number of reasons, obviously, technology is great, but when you get that many of your wellheads going through one product, it just makes inventory easier, it makes manufacturing easier as well. on the dxc connector we've seen two, three installs in norway, and we're starting to gain pretty good acceptance in that norway market around the dxc connector.
and then on xpak we've done two installs on xpak in deepwater and we're starting to see traction on that as well. so if you think about a big bore iie is way ahead, but following that is probably dxc and xpak. if you think about the vxte, vxte, we would expect that we hope to have an install, fourth quarter of this year maybe first quarter of next year. it's largely dependent on the well that's being drilled right now. i think we've talked about already that it's walter oil and gas that would do that. and it largely depends on how that well looks. if that works out well, then candidly, i think we'll see that move forward very quickly.
we're already in conversations with large iocs and other customers around vxte, but as you can appreciate, in our industry there is a lot of, i want to be the first to be second. and so i think everyone's anxiously looking at that install for the opportunity. so if you think about how we triangulate that it's really get the install in the fourth quarter. we've got to pull from the large iocs and major customers, and then we're working with one subsea they've looked at it from a technology standpoint, so it's really the trifecta of those three things happening that would prove success in the dxc.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, makes sense. now, how do you think about the r&d spend in your business going forward. since you've launched the e-series products, what type of projects are kind of next in the queue that you guys are working on?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
so one of the things that i'm working on you joked a little about being in seat.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
but as a new person in seat, really, it's really looking between now, and our february earnings call. and what i'd hope is, that i have february earnings call. we're coming out specifically talking about our r&d allocation. we'll continue to spend money on innovation, we'll continue to spend money on r&d we're keenly focused right now on energy transition. we believe we've got a real opportunity in carbon capture, we believe we've got a real opportunity in geothermal. it's not that we won't continue to invest in our normal core products, but those are two growth areas that we think are real opportunities.
and we'd like to talk about r&d in that february meeting as what percentage of our r&d are we spending on energy transition specifically around those two.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. that leads to my next question. because obviously alternative resources are a big topic today. top 26 is starting next week. how are you approaching our house dril-quip as a firm approaching energy energy transition? and how was the green by design campaign been resonating with customers? and what are the key benefits and advantages that your technology -- that do you have in your technology comparing to them?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i'll start with green by design that's been very well received by our customers. and in fact it plays nicely into the tender that i mentioned earlier, where we're specifically -- we've got specific targets around where carbon footprint reduction is, and we've talked a great deal about that in that e-series of products so that resonates very well with our customers. and just about across the board to be honest nocs, iocs and even some of the larger independents are very interested in that.
we did spend the summer really going through every opportunity from an energy transition standpoint. so we went through each of the major verticals, if you will around the energy transition. what we really landed on is the no regret that's for us. mark carbon capture and geothermal. it's not to say that we won't pay attention to anything else. it's just to say those are kind of the no regrets easy bets where we think we can gain traction in the short term. we are -- we did hire someone end at lead energy transition that person works directly for me. we continue to look at every other vertical and energy transition. and interestingly, where we are finding some opportunities. there is a lot of i'd characterize them is early phase companies that don't have manufacturing capability.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
and so the inbound calls we often get are those type of companies that say, hey, i've got this opportunity. i'm about to win a tender. i have no idea how, i'm going to scale this up and manufacturer. and so we are literally meeting. we've got our vp of manufacturing, and our engineers and our ops people meeting with the companies like that where they're just looking for a partner. and we're not looking to be a contract manufacturer for those companies, we're really looking to get a stake in the company when that happens. so if we're going to invest our time and energy and resources in setting up manufacturing for those companies what we look to do is get a small piece of that company.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
and if it's successful that's great for us. we'll leverage our manufacturing capability here. if it's not successful, it's a very low bet, very, very low no risk bet, if you will. so that's really how we're thinking about energy transition right now.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, ok, that makes sense. so, perhaps, maybe turning to some of the balance sheet items for a couple of minutes here. forge's balance sheet it's always been that way substantial cash, no debt, yet, we're going into an upturn. is there opportunity for cash at this point that you could potentially return to shareholders or m&a? is there other opportunity for cash? how are you thinking about capital allocation over the next several quarters?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes, i mean look, not unlike our r&d strategy capital allocation strategy is the same where we're working on that over the next few months. we estimate -- without any debt, we estimate we need $100 million to $150 million of cash to maintain the business, and even in an upturn. so that leaves the fair amount of excess cash. you saw we did some stock buyback.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
a little bit in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter as well. we'll always be thoughtful around how we're thinking about that buyback, we'll always be looking at opportunities there. but if i go out beyond that, we want to be more thoughtful around m&a and where our opportunities might be there. i think it's unquestionable that in the industry we're in right now, we need some level of consolidation.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
it's not a secret that at the size and revenue we're at today. it's a scale issue for us right now. and we're not alone in that. we could both name 6, 7, 8 our companies that are in that same spot. so we're constantly looking at those opportunities. and to be honest in early days one of the early things i'm doing is meeting with the ceos of all these other ofs companies, just to get a gauge for their view of the industry and where things are right now, and where there might be thoughtful partnerships.
and those might not always be m&a that might be a collaboration agreement as an example. but what we look to do in february is be more clear about articulating our capital allocation strategy. one piece is exactly how much we need in a recovery, but how much are we going to think about energy transition where i talked about these collaboration opportunities where we might invest small amounts from an energy transition standpoint. but then also being very clear and intentional about what an m&a strategy is going to look like. and probably a little more aggressive around that as well.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. okay. good to hear. and then you guys a lot of targets for this year. purely cash flow working capital improvements and free cash flow choose between the higher than the 5%, the revenue target. do you expect that to continue here? and the working capital trends have been moving in a positive direction as well. so maybe can you talk about those?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so yeah, we are trending higher. i mean we'll trend closer to a 10% number is sort of a 5% number this year. this is really been a year. we've seen a lot of great improvement in accounts receivable specifically getting past dues down specifically shrinking our time to invoice and things like that, that's got legs through the fourth quarter, it gets tougher to continue to do that, especially as we head into a recovery.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
next year. the days of getting huge progress payments, and things like that on large projects are not back yet. question whether they ever get back there, but they certainly won't be back there in the beginning. we did see a nice reduction inventory this quarter. and we're starting to, and i've commented several times around inventory and that that's just a much tougher lift. you've got to get the incoming orders, and literally we have a team of three to five people that's sit in a room and every time an order comes in they scour to see how can we use existing material on those incoming orders. it's starting to get traction. we believe that will continue in the fourth quarter. we believe that will continue into next year.
so, next year, we'll see ar start to level off from an opportunity standpoint. in fact if things start rebounding we might even see ar growth. and we would hope that inventory would continue to be an opportunity for us next year. we're probably tapped out on accounts payable. i think we've got a nice dpo number right now that we'd be challenging to expand beyond really where we are right now. it will -- but cash flow will continue to be a focus next year. but if we start to see multiple quarters of orders $100 million, you can expect we're going to have a little bit of a burn on working capital is very low they are.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. that makes perfect sense on an upturn. how do you expect capex to trend? either your current run rate looks like it's below that $15 million to $17 million expectation. do you think that moves up or you think we're in a good range? how we think about that?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, it will probably -- we will probably come in below that $15 million to $17 million. although, that's kind of a normal. i think we've typically characterize that as kind of our sustaining capex, if you will, that was around that much. we are looking at investments that we might need to make over the next 12, 18, 24 months to make sure that our manufacturing footprints position correctly, but we don't see anything right now that's material. but we'd probably talk about that more in february.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
if we have anything there.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure. and then inventories. you mentioned good inventory order this last third quarter. are there is still more improvements around there? and how do you think about inventory, as a competitive advantage as well? because it's going to be some guys that are going to be caught off guard when this recovery happens and they i don't have inventory.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so i'll talk about in two-fronts. one, is we do think there is opportunity, but i talked about the incoming orders, so it can be choppy over the next six quarters or so.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
where there'll be quarters like this quarter we got the 10 out there is going to be quarters where we don't get anything.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
really just because the right orders didn't come in, in the right timing. it's interesting around the competitive advantage. i talked about downhole tools, and the investment we made there. we now have in each of those key regions specific inventory targets, specific amount that we've invested in each of those. so we've pushed that out we're starting to see the revenue increase. i think the next opportunity right now is starting to improve the turns on the inventory that's been put out there. so right now, we're sitting in a 1.5 or 2 turn on that downhole tool inventory i'd like to get that to a 4-turn.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
but i'm not going to do it at the expense of revenue right now. so i'm willing to go a little slower on that.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
just to get that 30% revenue increase. if i think about it from a subsea standpoint, we've gone from 15 wellheads to 4 wellheads and we talk about big bore iie being 60% to 70% of our orders by the end of next year. we're really focused on how do we stock from those four wellheads that are left.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. okay.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
and what we're telling customers when we talk to big and small is, if you order one of these four you're going to get it faster. your lead time is going to be better, you're going to get it faster. you can order something it's not of those four, it's going to take longer. it's going to be more expensive.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
sure.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
and we almost exclusively see every customer saying how do i get myself in one of those four wellheads. because all of our customers candidly are looking to push the inventory hold back.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
and the supply chain, as much as they can. this just helps them be more competitive to be honest. so that's just one example of what we're doing from a stocking program. on a monthly basis we have what we call sales inventory operation planning, and we decide where we might just strategically stock in other places. so we might do that with a tree block, we might do that with connector or something like that, but downhole tools is a very intentional area that we're going to keep doing wellheads is a very intentional area that we'll keep doing.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. how should we think about the fourth quarter in terms of revenue and margins? and then, maybe think a little further out. what do you think more normalized margin profile would potentially look like?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so if we think about fourth quarter it's going to look very much like the third quarter to be honest. in fact be plus or minus a little bit, but let's be honest. when you get down into the revenue numbers that we're at a $1 million change, it looks like a big number, but it's not really that bigger number.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
in the grand scheme of things. so fourth quarter look much like the third quarter. and we become more dependent on orders now, as we get deeper into '22. so right now, we're really experience in those low or trends that we saw in '20 in the middle of the pandemic. we're starting to experience that, and that's starting to flow through in our revenue and ebitda. if i think about next year, and what that revenue trend looks like i talk about orders being up 20%, 25% year-on-year. that likely won't manifest in revenue until the back half of next year or early '23, to be honest. i mean we do get some incoming orders that we immediately get percentage of completion. but largely that will start to manifest back half of next year and '23. so from a revenue uptick.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and then margins, normalized margins?
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. normalized margins. i think, we expect to get back into the low '20s. if you're talking product margins.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. okay, it makes sense. blake this year last fireside chat last call with dril-quip. parting thoughts. i do have another follow-up question to that.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
okay.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
parting thoughts for shareholders and investors fans, employees.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
yeah. so it's.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
investors.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
so like i've said before this is me 40 years in the oilfield services, 33 of those which is dril-quip in the last 10 as a ceo. it's been an incredible ride. we were talking earlier today as i start to cleanup my office and the mementos and and things that i've saved to have more to do with the people that i've worked with and so i certainly appreciate working with all the employees and shareholders, and our board and our customers has been, it's been an incredible ride living all over the world and travel all over the world.
i pulled out my stack of passports, and say oh my god i've been on every continent of the antarctica, so and i'm really optimistic about the future. i mean that's one of the reasons i feel comfortable stepping away. now i feel comfortable jeff, taking this on board and we got a good team here, and i believe dril-quip is positioned to actually outgrow the market.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
good.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
i'm optimistic of the go forward.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
but we're optimistic, as well. so, maybe to finish off our chat today, blake. i didn't have the good fortune of meeting your wife recently and then so i know she is namely ceo of her business. but i'm not sure you got the same job description.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
yeah, she.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
so what are your plans for the future?
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
yeah. so my wife and i have built a vineyard in a winery in central texas. we live -- she up there, and it's been been operational for a little over six years now and she runs that, that's for business to run. so when i was talking about stepping down i had to negotiate a position at the winery. she is a tough negotiator. and she's told me several times i don't think you're going to like your new boss very much. but you did, she did finally agreed to let me retain the title of ceo and i was pretty excited about that. and then, she said so let me define for your job duties that means that you are responsible for cleaning electrical and other. so.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
other sounds scary.
blake t. deberry -- director and chief executive officer
the other parts pretty scary, particularly when i just has to do with something in the bathroom. but, yeah, just looking forward to spend a little more time together. and today i'm going up to watch my grandkids play soccer for the first time. so just yeah have more family life and make wine.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's a good plan blake. so, blake you had a great run at dril-quip great run as ceo. congratulations to you on stewarding the company, as well as you have jeff. best of luck, as we move forward here. because it's you and me now and blake is going to say as well. so we'll give it a go.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
i look forward to it.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
absolutely. well, thanks everybody for listening in today, and i think with that we'll go ahead and end the call.
jeffrey j. bird -- president and chief operating officer
alright. thank you, james. thanks, james.
james west -- evercore isi -- analyst
