ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation q3 2019 earnings call.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead ms. campbell.
kim campbell -- methanex corporation
thank you. good morning everyone. welcome to our third quarter 2019 results conference call. our 2019 third quarter news release management's discussion and analysis and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information by its nature is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcome to differ materially from the actual outcome. certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusions or making the forecasts or projections which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our third quarter 2019 md&a and 2018 annual report for more information. i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex' future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters.
for clarification any references to revenue ebitda cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility. in addition we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this manner.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex' president and ceo mr. john floren for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. in the third quarter of 2019 we recorded adjusted ebitda of $90 million and adjusted net loss of $21 million or $0.27 per share. adjusted ebitda was lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter primarily because of lower average realized price which is only partially offset by higher sales volume of methanex-produced methanol and improved costs compared to the second quarter. our average realized price was $272 per tonne in the third quarter which reflects a decline of $54 per tonne from the $326 per tonne that we realized in the second quarter as our posted prices were lower across all regions and we recorded a discount rate of 17.5%. when prices decline our discount rate tends to be higher than our guidance of 15%.
we estimate that the industry cost curve which is set in china is currently around $260 per tonne and current prices in china are slightly below this range. we recently posted our november north american price which remains unchanged at $342 per tonne and our asia pacific price which remains unchanged at $295 per tonne. our european contract price is set on a quarterly basis and our fourth quarter posted price is eur 280 per tonne. methanol industry demand in the third quarter of 2019 increased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2019. traditional chemical demand declined slightly as a result of planned and unplanned downstream outages nationwide safety and environmental inspections in china and a slowdown in manufacturing activity particularly in the automotive and construction demand segments. demand into energy-related applications was strong as 2 new methanol-to-olefins or mto plants with a combined capacity to consume 3.6 million tonnes of methanol annually started up at the end of june.
this new mto demand was partially offset by plan maintenance activities. at some existing mto plants we continue to see steady operating rates for most mto facilities. methanol industry supply outside china operate as well in the third quarter of 2019. we observe some high cost producers in china reduce operating rates in a quarter one spot prices just below the industry cost curve. we're excited to welcome 3 new ocean-going vessels powered by methanol fuel technology to our waterfront shipping fleet during the quarter. these vessels can run on methanol fuel oil marine diesel or gas oil. we have 1 additional methanol-powered vessel joining the fleet in the coming weeks. and with this addition approximately 40% of our fleet will be capable of running on methanol fuel technology. now turning to our operational results. in new zealand we produced 469000 tonnes during the third quarter compared to 446000 tonnes in the second quarter.
upstream natural gas producers in new zealand are completing significant field development projects to increase production. however we do not expect to see any impact of these activities in 2020. based on our current contract gas position we are revising our guidance to approximately 80% operating rates for our new zealand operations in 2020 or approximately 1.9 million tonnes. in trinidad our plants operated well. we produced 474000 tonnes during q3 compared to 384000 tonnes in q2. production was higher in the third quarter as our second quarter production was impacted by a turnover at the titan plant and a short unplanned outage at our atlas facility. we continue to guide to approximately 85% operating rates for our trinidad operations. in chile we produced 146000 tonnes during the third quarter of 2019 compared to 290000 tonnes during the second quarter.
production was lower in the third quarter, as only the chilly for plant operated during the quarter layer. late in the second quarter we began the first phase of the refurbishment of our chilly one plant, which was scheduled to match lower natural gas deliveries during the southern hemisphere winter months. until one time we started in early october. both plants are operating at high rates today. we expect significantly higher production in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter from our chili facilities during their summer months when we receive higher gas deliveries.during the southern hemisphere winter months. the chile i plant restarted in early october. both plants are operating at high rates today and we expect significantly higher production in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter from our chile facilities during their summer months when we receive higher gas deliveries. in addition we were very pleased to announce that we reached a longer-term natural gas supply agreement for our chile operations that will underpin approximately 25% of a 2-plant operation through the end of 2025. this gas agreement and the completion of the first phase of the chile i refurbishment reflect important steps to returning our assets in chile back to full operating rates over the coming years at very low capital costs. in the near term we continue to guide to annual operating rates of up to 75% of a 2-plant operation or annual production of up to approximately 1.3 million tonnes per year.
in egypt we completed the necessary repairs at our facility and restarted our plant safely in august following the unplanned outage that began in early april. we estimate that the egypt outage had an impact of approximately $20 million reflecting our 50% share of egypt on our q3 adjusted ebitda results. we have insurance that covers repairs and business interruption subject to deductibles. however no insurance recoveries have been recorded to date. now turning to our approach to capital allocation. our balanced approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. we believe we're well positioned to meet our financial commitments execute on our growth projects in chile and louisiana and deliver on our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. in terms of our financial commitments our expected maintenance capital expenditures for the remainder of 2019 are estimated to be $30 million primarily related to turnarounds planned for 2020.
we continue to advance 2 near-term growth projects to increase our production capacity for very low capital cost. in chile we continue to work with gas suppliers in chile and argentina and they were optimistic they will be able to secure sufficient gas to underpin a full 2-plant operation over the medium term. in louisiana we continue to make progress on the debottlenecking opportunities at our existing geismar 1 and geismar 2 facilities to increase production by approximately 10% or 200000 tonnes per year for a few tens of millions of dollars. we are completing the necessary work required including construction of a pipeline to bring co2 to the site and the necessary work at the geismar 2 plant. we expect that the incremental production capacity will be phased in over the next couple of years.
we have begun construction of our third plant in geismar louisiana an advantaged growth opportunity for our company which we believe will create significant long-term value for shareholders. geismar 3 will be a 1.8 million-tonne methanol plant located adjacent to the geismar 1 and geismar 2 facilities. we expect this project will deliver outstanding returns based on its substantial capital and operating cost advantages. we believe we're well positioned to complete this project as we have a rigorous and well-defined execution plan an experienced team in place and a robust and flexible financing plan. we ended the quarter with $857 million in cash on the balance sheet. in september we issued $700 million in 10-year notes.
and subsequent to the quarter end we used $350 million of the proceeds to repay the unsecured notes that were due at the end of this year. the remaining proceeds are earmarked to fund geismar 3 construction expenditures. in addition we have a strong liquidity position with an $800 million construction loan facility for the geismar 3 project that remains undrawn and a $300 million undrawn revolver -- revolving credit facility to provide further financial flexibility to manage potential unforeseen business stress. as we have stated previously we have a preference for a strategic partner for the g3 project and we continue to pursue that option. during the quarter we paid $27 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. up to june 30 2019 we repurchased nearly 1.1 million shares of the approximately 3.9 million shares approved under the normal course issuer bid.
we did not repurchase shares in the third quarter. now turning to the outlook -- our outlook for the fourth quarter. based on posted methanol prices so far this quarter we expect average realized prices in q4 to be slightly lower than q3. we expect production in the fourth quarter to be substantially higher than the third quarter as both of our chile plants are operating during the southern hemisphere's summer months and our egypt plant is back online. we expect adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter to be higher than the third quarter. i would now be happy to answer any questions.

[operator instructions] the first question is from mike leithead with barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.i guess first if i look at the supply demand commentary you provided in your release it appears you saw methanol demand up a bit sequentially yet prices were down call it 15% 20% sequentially. so i was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply side? and maybe where you're seeing incremental supply that drove such a move in the quarter.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i mentioned already pricing is just slightly below the cost curve in china. we've seen the industry outside china operate very well the last 2 quarters and better than on average over the past number of years which has caused a little bit of extra supply.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then just on geismar 3 could you provide us with any update on your discussions for potential partner for this project? is that still on the table at this point? or any update there would be helpful.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our preference is to have a partner for the project and we're pursuing that option. we're in discussion with a couple of parties about potential partnerships. and well you should expect us to approach a couple of parties at a time to gauge interest and discussions are ongoing. and our preference is still to have a partner for about 30% of the project.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you.the next question is from eric petrie with citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi, good morning, jack.you noted that the energy-related methanol demand increased 6% quarter-over-quarter. if i exclude the 2 new mto plants what was the underlying demand growth? or was it flat?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well the traditional chemical as we mentioned was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. we saw quite a few unplanned and planned outages in the downstream. i already mentioned in my remarks that the automotive and construction sectors are a bit weak as well.
eric b petrie -- - citigroup inc research division -- analyst
okay. and secondly china methanol inventories still look like they remain elevated around 900000 metric tonnes. where is normalized levels? and is that an important driver to getting prices higher in the region?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we see inventory levels at that level but i wouldn't call it high because remember we've got a lot more demand as a result of the additions of mto. i think the challenge in china today is lack of storage capability. even though demand has gone up significantly over the past few years storage has not kept pace. and here's -- we are experiencing we see situations during the quarter where ships are lined up to try and unload cargoes because the tanks are full and that's more of a -- as a result of not enough storage which can lead to some pricing of distressed cargoes. so we think we need to see more storage built to meet the increased demand for methanol especially on the coast in china.
eric b petrie -- - citigroup inc research division -- analyst
great, thank you.

the next question is from jacob bout with cibc.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
good morning.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
morning.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
i wanted to ask some questions around the gas contracts in chile and maybe a bit about the structure of these gas contracts. what was the origin? is this conventional nonconventional? and is there any price participation with the supplier?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so these are for about 25% of our requirements for the 2-plant operation. these are all -- this is all gases on the chile side of the border all unconventional. all the activity in chile has been going after tight gas over the last five or six years. so this is tight gas and there is a sharing mechanism in this contract that works similar to what i've guided to before. we're about 1/3. we share with the producer above $200 methanol in that kind of ballpark.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
okay. and then in egypt can you quantify what the losses were from the outages in the quarter? and then how much are you actually expecting to be covered by insurance?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we -- in my opening remarks i mentioned our half about $20 million ebitda impact in the quarter. there are some deductibles like i mentioned and we have made an insurance claim. and we expect to be able to collect on that insurance claim less the deductibles.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
and is this going to extend into fourth quarter into 2020?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
the outage or the insurance claim?
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
these outages losses that you're taking there.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so with the plant came up back up in early october it has been running extremely well since then. so that issue is behind us and we made the insurance claim. and whether we get it in q4 or q1 it's too early to tell but we expect to be able to collect on the insurance.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
thanks, john.
operator
thank you.the next question is from joel jackson with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
joel jackson -- bmo capital -- analyst
hi, good morning, john if you could give us some sort of valuation metrics around what you would be looking for in a 30% stake in some of the different conditions at g3? and then also as you've been starting to price out long lead-time items how maybe capex is faring -- your expectations for capex faring in that $1.3 billion $1.4 billion range for g3?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so just to correct something i just said the egypt plant came up in early august not october. i apologize. but for g3 yes we're having partnership discussions like i said for about 30% not just financial considerations but strategic considerations. we're talking to potentially other producers of methanol that may be looking to build their own facility somewhere around the world where we could partner together or a customer somebody that might be consuming 600000 tonnes or so of methanol have several locations around the world where they need methanol. and this would help them backward integrate into some equity tonnes. so both of those kinds of conversations are ongoing not with chinese companies not with american companies but other parts of the world. what was the second part of your question joel?
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
now that you're getting some long lead-time items starting to get priced how your capex is faring within that $1.3 billion $1.4 billion range?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so all of the long lead items that we placed the purchase orders for have come back either what we had been -- indicated in a quote or less. so we're not seeing any surprises on the capital side. i'd say -- i was just down there 2 weeks ago. the -- some of the other competing projects that we expected to be fid-ed over the coming months seemed to be somewhat delayed. so as far as productivity and labor availability i'm getting way more comfortable today than i was even three months ago about our ability to execute on this project within the range of capital we've provided.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, joel.
operator
thank you.the next question is from hassan ahmed with alembic global.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
sorry i was on mute. morning, john wanted to revisit the demand side of things. it seems that the energy-related demand sort of ticked up quite nicely quarter-on-quarter in q3 and conventional demand was down a tad bit. so i mean celanese recently reported their q3 number and they were talking about as much as 25% of their acetic acid capacity down in the quarter. and it seems also sipchem and saudi had a turnaround as well. so as i think through that and sort of think about the negative sort of conventional demand growth that you guys saw in q3 should we expect a lot of that demand growth to come back now in q4?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we saw the same thing you mentioned. we saw some unplanned and planned downtime from -- especially on the chemical side of the equation. we do plan and see this part of the 55% demand for methanol the chemical side to grow at ip and gdp growth rates. so provided we're seeing positive gdp and ip growth rates we would expect those demands to grow at those amounts. now having said that quarter-by-quarter they do vary. but usually q4 in any given year is a strong demand quarter for methanol especially in the chemical products. and we're not seeing anything that would change our beliefs around that.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
understood. understood. and as a follow-up in your earlier remarks you talked about sort of chinese environmental inspections again sort of popping up and the like. are you seeing any sort of environmental sort of curtailments at all within the chinese methanol industry?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're seeing some in -- not only in the methanol but in the downstream products more. there have been quite a few industrial accidents in china and that is leading to these inspections. and safety is a big concern for us and for the chinese. so i think our -- we're probably going to continue to see these inspections both on methanol and methanol-derivative plants going forward.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you.the next question is from john roberts with ubs. please go ahead.
john ezekiel e. roberts -- ubs investment bank research division -- analyst
thank you.the timing of the 10% debottlenecks for geismar 1 and 2 is that being done to take advantage of any of the synergies with geismar 3 or because of the upcoming downtime at those sites?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no. this should -- this has nothing to do with geismar 3. this is totally isolated projects. similar -- john this is similar to what we did in medicine hat a number of years ago where we had a co2 source across the fence from an ammonia plant. and by introducing co2 into our production process because we have excess hydrogen we can get more methanol for the same kit. so we've contracted for co2 in louisiana with a supplier of co2 and we're in the process of building a pipeline to bring that to our site. when we did the g1 turnaround earlier this year we've put in the necessary equipment to be able to introduce co2 into the system and we'll do the same when we do the geismar 2 turnaround in the coming quarters. so that work has been done. the co2 pipeline has to be built. so you should think of the first g1 sometime in the end of next -- first quarter next year and then about a year after for g2. but that's just roughly guidelines for today and we still have to complete the work.
john ezekiel e. roberts -- ubs investment bank research division -- analyst
and then are you seeing any higher shipping costs from imo 2020? and do you expect to have to eat that or it will just reduce the netbacks?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we are in our budgeting process right now for next year and we're obviously trying to forecast what's going to happen to -- well methanol i guess we have a better view but the ultra-low sulfur diesel market. and when you see both sides you see some people think that that's going to spike in price and others think that there's enough refining capacity to meet the demand. and i guess nobody will know until we actually get the demand in q1. but yes we will experience higher fuel costs which will lead to higher freight in our supply chain. and we'll continue to price methanol based on the cost curve and based on the supply demand balances. so we and other suppliers -- if nothing changes on the price side we'd be eating that additional freight.
operator
thank you.the next question is from steve hansen with raymond james. please go ahead.
steven p. hansen -- raymond james ltd -- analyst
yeah, guys, that,john just a quick one here on the partners for g3. how should we think about the timing of your pursuit of a partner here given that you've now started construction? i only ask because every month that passes now the project arguably derisks a little more. and i'm just thinking that that's got to be a difficult or a sliding scale backdrop for ongoing negotiations. so are you able to think about a time line or some sort of like milestone that you would like to have a partner locked up by? and given the context of current negotiations how should we think about that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we wanted to have the partner before we fid-ed but here we are. i agree with you that as time goes by the project does get considerably derisked. we still preference to have a partner for this project and that may impact the buy-in price as the project gets derisked. but our -- still our preference is to have a partner and we'll pursue that. and like i said before we're not talking to 10 parties at the same time. we're talking to a couple and we've put some fairly aggressive time lines as we're talking to our potential partners because if there's no interest we'd like to go on to some other potential partners. so we'll continue to pursue that strategy and we're optimistic we'll secure a partner. and we'll continue to work toward that.
steven p. hansen -- raymond james ltd -- analyst
okay. helpful. and then just one quickly on the supply side as it relates to iran lots to talk about potentially iranian start-ups at some point. what is your supply chain telling you? what have you seen in the channel? and have there been any indications on shipping from either bashir one of the other projects as yet? just anything you're seeing on that front would be helpful.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we don't have any special intelligence from iran because being a u.s.-traded company we obviously can't be doing any business at all with iran. we have seen the iranian production in the quarter operate much better than we had anticipated. so they continue to run and they continue to be able to ship mainly to china and india. so that was a bit of the upside on the supply side as well. i read the same things you do steve about the next plan. i really don't have any special intel over and above what you read and i read.
steven p. hansen -- raymond james ltd -- analyst
and then just squeezing one last one if i may on the chile ramp for q4. can you just give us some better context? i know you noted that chile i has restarted. but can you just give us a sense for what kind of ramp or what kind of utilization are -- we should expect in q4?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so what i've guided to is 75% operating rates for the year for the 2-plant operation. and what i've said is full rates for plant 1 and plant four for the nine months when we're not experiencing their winter and 1-plant operation during their winter. so i would expect provided everything goes well with the operational plants full rates in q4.
steven p. hansen -- raymond james ltd -- analyst
okay, very good. thank you.
operator
thank you.and the next question is from jonas oxgaard with bernstein. please go ahead.
jonas i. oxgaard -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
good morning.when looking at your non-u.s. margins historically there's been a strong correlation between the margins and the price presumably due to the raw material formula. but that seems to have broken down lately. the margins have been much lower than the pricing suggests. has something changed in your formulas? or how should i think about this?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think we've guided to this in the past. so about 55% to 60% of our gas today is this formula-based gas and that's mainly in -- outside north america. when inside north america you should think of more fixed-price gas in our portfolio. we do have some fixed-price gas in other parts and -- but mainly it's formula outside north america and fixed in north america.
jonas i. oxgaard -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
yes. i was only looking at the non-u.s. or non-north america margins. because something has really changed. and is there a good reason for why the margin is lower than it's historically been at these methanol prices then?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i'd have to take it offline. i have -- i don't have the numbers in front of me. so i mean egypt didn't run during the quarter and we have -- that's a very high-margin business for us. so we didn't have any sales. there were very few sales from egypt. so that could have impacted but i'd have to look at the numbers.
jonas i. oxgaard -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you.the next question is from nelson ng with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks.so john just for new zealand could you just give a bit more color in terms of the gas market there? and i guess the -- i presume there isn't a spot market so you can't really get more gas in 2020 in terms of that 80% utilization. and then i guess the second question relates to kind of long term for new zealand in 2021 like do you generally expect the utilization and gas availability to improve?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well we've been experiencing a lot of maintenance activities in the upstream in the last number of quarters. so i thought it would be best to guide to what we expect as opposed to disappointing each and every quarter. just how we think about new zealand it's 2.4 million tonnes at full capacity. that's assuming we get the high co2 gas which we haven't gotten for 10 years. so the actual capacity we've gotten in the last 10 years is around 2.2 million. now there is high co2 gas available and we're still actively trying to contract that. but we haven't done that yet. so the way i think about it without the high co2 gas it's a 2.2 million-tonne facility and we've been experiencing like i said shortages because of maintenance and other activity. i guess the good news is shell has sold their business to omv and omv have -- are investing hundreds of millions of dollars not only in the infrastructure but in developing existing reserves as well as lots of other activities from todd and others. you're right there is no spot market there for gas or very little spot market. so all the gas that we would consume in our plants is contracted. so the country itself just redetermine the reserves in egypt up by 20% year-over-year which i think is very positive. so yes i think we're going to have probably similar operating rates that we had this year next year. but '21 and beyond we're optimistic we can get to the 2.2 million and possibly the 2.4 million if we can get the high co2 gas. and i know our team there is working hard toward that goal.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. got it. and then the next question relates to the ncib. like obviously you've taken a pause in q3. i was just wondering what your -- what you need to see in your balance sheet or cash flow to start repurchases again.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so what i've said is that we've had this target of about $200 million of cash on the balance sheet that's not borrowed money that's actually generated -- excess cash to the operations. we're increasing that guidance to $300 million as we're completing the g3 project. beyond the $300 million we would plan to return excess cash to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. the dividend is going to be -- we look at it once a year around april time and make a call whether we grow it or keep it the way it is and we'll look at it again around the agm time. when we look at our internal numbers above $300 methanol realized we believe that we can complete the project on our own and have a little bit of excess cash to repurchase shares. so it'll be a factor of methanol price. and like i said we'll still want to build that cash balance up to $300 million before we would start to exercise the ncib again.

the next question is from matthew blair with tudor pickering. please go ahead.
matthew robert lovseth blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
hey, good morning.so your net leverage is moving up with the debt issuance. can you remind us of any sort of i guess like max targets or parameters? and what are the chances that you have to issue equity down the road here?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. issuing equity is probably -- i never say never but highly unlikely. maybe i'll ask ian our cfo to comment on the leverage.
ian cameron -- senior vice president, finance and cfo
yes. our target leverage from a balance sheet perspective is 2x to 3x debt to ebitda. and as we've described before we live within that range in methanol prices above $300 a tonne. so at $300 a tonne we achieve a leverage ratio of around 3x. and if you go higher than that obviously it goes a lot lower. and that's how we've been running our balance sheet.
matthew robert lovseth blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
sounds good. and then just a clarification on the commentary on global methanol demand side. i think in q2 you said that your estimate for global methanol demand was up three% year-over-year. and then the commentary talked about a slight improvement in q3. so i guess should we be thinking about like a three% to four% year-over-year growth rate for global methanol demand this past quarter?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think going forward it's about 3% to 4% including the mto. so it depends on how the mto runs. and it's hard for us to forecast the future operating rates of our customers whether they have problems or take downtime. but i think that's a good range of growth.
matthew robert lovseth blair -- tudor pickering holt -- analyst
great, thank you.

thank you.the next question is from chris shaw with monness crespi. please go ahead.
christopher lawrence shaw -- - monness crespi hardt & co. inc. research division -- analyst
good morning, john. how you doing?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good. thanks, chris.
christopher lawrence shaw -- - monness crespi hardt & co. inc. research division -- analyst
i have a question or clarification on the $20 million ebitda impact from egypt. is that just cost that you guys had to spend? or was that just sort of reflective of the volume you didn't produce as well? or can you just give color on that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
so as i mentioned we obviously have an insurance for both the equipment and business interruption with a deductible. so that's the combination of both.
christopher lawrence shaw -- - monness crespi hardt & co. inc. research division -- analyst
okay. and then i had a question about the new trinidad plant that's coming up. i thought trinidad was -- i think you guys were always having some problems getting gas down there. and i'm just curious do you have any like color on why -- how that plant was developed? and i'm not even sure who's the owner down there. and will they have enough gas? and will that impact your gas availability at all?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well since that isn't my project i'm not going to make any comments on it. i've guided to 85% operating rates for our plants based on what we've been told to expect for gas and i'm comfortable with that guidance at this time.
christopher lawrence shaw -- - monness crespi hardt & co. inc. research division -- analyst
do you know who the owner of that plant is? or is it...
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's japanese plus they hold a small shareholding of a local trinidad company.

thank you. [operator instructions] the last question is from cherilyn radbourne with td securities. please go ahead.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities equity research -- analyst
thanks very much and good morning,most of my questions have been asked so i'll just ask a couple of quick ones. i was also looking for a clarification on the $20 million referenced with respect to egypt. would that have related just to the plant outage? or would that have also included additional logistics costs that you might have incurred from a supply chain perspective?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
that's just the insurable amount which is the equipment plus lost margin i would say business interruption. so i think one of the reasons our logistics costs were higher in the quarter was because of the outage and we had to reconfigure our supply chain as a result of bringing product into the mediterranean from farther distances which led to higher costs on our logistics. and that would be shown in our logistics costs as opposed to in the insurance claim.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities equity research -- analyst
okay. so that should normalize in q4 and going forward then as well?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. but i'll -- again i'll remind you that we will be paying higher for fuel starting january because of the new imo regulations. so we expect it to normalize in q4 but see our logistics costs go up starting next year because of the higher fuel cost.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities equity research -- analyst
okay. and then just in terms of the gas supply in chile can you just clarify how far out you've now contracted gas to support up to 75% of a 2-plant operation?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we have 25% contracted out through 2025 and that's the chile contract. the balance we're getting from argentina different lines of contracts but they're shorter-term and we're in the process of renegotiating those.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities equity research -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to methanex corporation q2 2020 earnings call.
i will now turn the meeting over to ms. campbell. please go ahead, ms. campbell.
kim campbell -- director, investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to our second quarter 2020 results conference call. our 2020 second quarter news release, management's discussion and analysis, and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcome to differ materially from the actual outcome. certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projections which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our second quarter 2020 md&a and to our 2019 annual report for more information.
i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex's future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters. for clarification, any references to revenue, ebitda, cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility. in addition, we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated to specific identified events. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this manner.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's president and ceo, mr. john floren, for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. we hope that everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy. we will start with a few comments about the current environment and then speak to our q2 results, provide an overview of the methanol market and discuss how we are managing our business in this challenging environment, while positioning ourselves to benefit from the recovery in the global economy. our number one priority remains the safety of our employees, contractors and communities where we work, and we are thankful that our team is safe and healthy.
we continue to evaluate the risk at each of our locations to ensure the safety of our team members and we continue to take extensive health and safety measures across our operations and offices as we begin to return to our workplaces at most of our locations. we have again demonstrated the resilience of our business model as our operations and global supply chain continue to run effectively in a different, very difficult environment and our ability to service customers has not been significantly impacted by the pandemic. a big thank you to the entire team for a job well done. now, turning to our second quarter results. this is a very challenging quarter for the methanol industry and our company. due to the impact of covid-19 and low oil prices, we recorded adjusted ebitda of $32 million and an adjusted net loss of $64 million or $0.84 per share. our results were significantly lower compared to our first quarter due to a lower average realized price and lower sales volume, which were partly offset by lower production and selling, general and administration costs.
also, our margins tend to be lower in a declining price environment compared to a stable price environment. generally, the opposite applies when methanol prices are rising. we estimate that inventory timing differences reduced adjusted ebitda by approximately $25 million in the quarter. we estimate global methanol demand declined by approximately 5% or 1 million tons in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter, reflecting significant declines in most parts of the world outside china. the demand impact in china resulting from manufacturing shutdowns due to covid-19 was felt the most in the first quarter. if we compare the second quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we will see the full impact of covid-19 where we estimate that quarterly global methanol demand declined by approximately 12% or 2.5 million tons. prior to covid-19, annual methanol demand was expected to increase by 3% to 4% or approximately 3 million tons in 2020 compared to 2019.
in china, methanol demand increased by approximately 4% in the second quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter as economic activity began to recover from seasonally lower levels and covid-19 impacts. ground transportation increased and fuel demand improved. methanol demand improved across both traditional chemical applications such as formaldehyde and energy-related applications such as mtbe, dme and other fuel applications. methanol-to-olefin demand was particularly strong as several plants restarted and maintained high operating rates following planned and unplanned outages in the first quarter and supported by a significant improvement in ethylene pricing in the second quarter. outside of china, methanol demand declined by approximately 19% quarter-over-quarter. traditional chemical demand declined due to significantly lower manufacturing activity, particularly in the automotive and construction markets, which are both major consumers of methanol. demand into energy-related applications, including mtbe, declined due to reduced ground transportation and fuel demand. global methanol industry supply also declined in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter due to various outages and shutdowns around the world, but not quickly enough to offset the global decline in methanol demand which led to prices falling below the cost curve in q2.
as we've previously announced, we idled our titan plant in trinidad in mid-march and our chile iv plant as of april 1. we have seen other producers in trinidad, argentina, the netherlands, russia, and china reduce operating rates or shut down. we'd estimate that global methanol supply declined by approximately 9% when comparing the second quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2019. overall, production in the second quarter was 379,000 tons lower than the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to the idling of our titan and chile iv facilities. early in the third quarter of 2020, improving methanol demand and methanol plant outages in southeast asia and the middle east have impacted market conditions and provided support for higher methanol prices. we estimate that the industry cost curve, which continues to be set in china, was approximately $200 to $220 per ton. spot prices in china are marginally below the cost curve today. we recently posted our august north american price, which remained at $276 per ton, and our asia-pacific price which increased by 14% to $245 per ton. our european contract price is set quarterly and our third quarter posted price of eur235 per ton. we believe that the outlook over the coming months remains uncertain and it's difficult to predict the full impact of covid-19 pandemic and the lower oil price environment on methanol demand. as previously announced, we have taken several steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and preserve liquidity, including deferring approximately $500 million in capital spending on the geismar 3 project for up to 18 months, reducing our quarterly dividends will result in approximately $100 million in annualized cash savings, and reduced 2020 maintenance capital spending by $30 million.
as you are aware, our cost structure moves with the price of methanol. the price we pay for approximately 60% of our natural gas we consume, which is our most significant operating cost, is linked to methanol prices. this means that our operating cost move down as methanol prices decline, although there is a time lag of up to one quarter. we expect that a lower oil price environment will offset our previously anticipated increase in shipping costs due to the new international maritime organization's 2020 regulations. we also continue to actively manage our operating cost across the organization during the current downturn due to covid-19. we have a strong liquidity position and ended the quarter with nearly $800 million in cash on the balance sheet. we expect that we only need to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $150 million to run the business day to day. we have no near-term debt maturities. we also recently announced that we amended our $300 million committed revolving credit facility and $800 million non-revolving construction facility, which provides meaningful financial covenant relief.
as we previously announced, we've placed our geismar 3 project on temporary care and maintenance. prior to making this decision, the project had been significantly de-risked and our project execution was safe, on time and on budget. we will consider a number of factors before deciding on whether to restart the project, including the pace of the global economic recovery, methanol market conditions, our ability to effectively finance the project, and the ability for suppliers to execute construction and to deliver material and equipment. given the uncertainty in the broader economic environment due to covid-19, we continue to plan for a wide range of scenarios, including ones where we see a more prolonged period of lower methanol demand and continued bottom cycle pricing. we are focused on cash preservation and continue to evaluate all options to ensure we maintain financial capacity and flexibly to navigate the current environment and emerge stronger over the cycle as conditions improve.
we will not undertake share buybacks in this environment as any excess cash will be used to further strengthen our balance sheet. now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter. we expect the outlook over the near term to be uncertain and we cannot predict the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic and lower oil price environment on the methanol market. while we have seen higher methanol pricing in the recent weeks, based on our posted methanol prices so far this quarter, we expect average realized prices in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. we expect our production levels in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter. however, as prices stabilize, we expect that the timing differences due to our fifo, first in first out, inventory accounting will have less of an impact on costs. we expect adjusted ebitda to be similar in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
before pausing for questions, we'd like to highlight a couple of points regarding the resilience of our business. while the near-term outlook is uncertain, we expect continued long-term demand growth for methanol. methanol is a key ingredient that serves as a building block to produce a multitude of everyday items used to construct and insulate our homes and automotive components to make cars lighter and in the technology that keeps us connected. in many cases, there are limited, if any cost, effective substitutes for methanol in many of these applications. methanol is also used in an increasing number of energy-related application, and is a clean burning and economic alternative fuel. demand for methanol will eventually rebound as global economic activity recovers. as the industry leader with a global production footprint, integrated global supply chain and low cost structure, we have continued to deliver secure and reliable supply to our customers globally, which is our competitive advantage, enables us to be the supplier of choice to customers around the world.
our production assets are well positioned on the industry cost curve to be competitive through the methanol price cycle. we have a strong cash flow potential with significant leverage to methanol prices. we estimate that every $10 change in our average realized methanol price results in approximately $60 million increase to adjusted ebitda on an annual basis. finally, we have unique growth opportunities in louisiana, allowing us to increase our production capacity at advantaged capital cost when conditions improve to enhance our global leadership position and create significant shareholder value in the stronger global economic environment. we remain focused on operating our plants safely and reliably, delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers and protecting our balance sheet. we believe that our resilient business model and strong liquidity position will enable us to navigate this challenging environment and position ourselves to generate significant long-term value as global market conditions recover.
we will now be happy to answer any questions.

perfect, thank you. [operator instructions]. the first question is from jacob bout. your line is open. please go ahead.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
hi. good morning.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
i want to start off on g3. and maybe you can just talk about your ability to push that out further than the 18 months, i.e. later than 2021, and any financial penalties to do so?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. when we renegotiated our recent revolvers, including the construction facility, we did get some relief on the completion date for g3. so, we have pushed that out a little farther.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
how far out?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
another 12 months.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
okay. and then, can you just talk about the incremental cost, if any, from covid-specific events in the quarter?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
a very minor incremental cost, really to do with working remotely, some technology probably, but very, very insignificant.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
okay. and then, just last question here global methanol demand. so, you gave the numbers of ex-china down 19% in second quarter. i'd be interested in hearing on how things actually improved through the quarter and what july is looking like?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's difficult to predict demand in this environment, jacob. we'll continue to watch it, but i'd say outside china we're still seeing significant pressure on downstream end use products and demand is slow to recover. so, we'll continue to watch it, but i think it's too early to predict demand recovery.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
were things significantly worse in april than june?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i don't want to go month-by-month because it's better to look at quarter-by-quarter, but i'd say demand is still significantly down from where it was q4 2019.
jacob bout -- cibc world markets -- analyst
all right. i'll leave it there. thank you, john.
operator
thank you. the next question is from ben isaacson. your line is open. please go ahead.
ben isaacson -- scotia capital -- analyst
good morning. thank you. john, we've read that inventory levels at chinese ports are reportedly high. can you kind of put that into context as to how you see global inventory levels through the channel?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
china levels continue to go up and sort of the demand is quite a bit higher because of mto operating in china. and we've said before that we haven't seen the terminal capacity increase in china to the extent it needs to accommodate for the new demand on the coast. so, we would characterize inventory levels today probably more normal than high. i'd say they were certainly high as we entered the quarter with all the uncertainty. india basically shutting down, so most of the iranian production ended up in china, which led to higher inventory levels. globally, including our own levels, we wouldn't characterize inventory levels as high, but more i would say normal.
ben isaacson -- scotia capital -- analyst
celanese stated yesterday that they see global acetic acid inventories as being low. do you think that's a meaningful tailwind to reduce methanol inventories?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, acetic acid of the chemical demand, i think, is about 9%. so, we'll take any new demand we can get versus where we've been. but i don't think -- even if it goes up by double digit, it's not going to have a significant impact on the overall methanol supply/demand balance.
ben isaacson -- scotia capital -- analyst
and my last question is, you realized $8 million in savings in q2 versus q1. how much of that do you think is sustainable on a run rate basis going forward?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i guess it depends on how covid-19 continues to impact our ability to do things like travel. and our company is set up as a collaborative-type company. we have a lot of global teams that meet on a regular basis. and all of that, obviously, has ended. and obviously, in this environment, when we're looking at hiring and things like that, we're being very cautious.
to me, i think the question is, what is the longer-term or medium-term demand for methanol? we were setting up the company to be growing in line with the methanol market, which was 4% to 5%. and obviously, that's totally changed right now. so, we may need fewer people going forward if we don't see a rebound in methanol demand. and if we do, then, obviously, we'll adjust our cost structure as a result.
so, i'd say the savings that we've achieved, we can maintain them in the current environment.
ben isaacson -- scotia capital -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from joel jackson. your line is open. please go ahead.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i have a few questions. so, the first one would be, if i heard your data point correctly in the prepared remarks, you talked about methanol market contracting about 12% between q4 of 2019 and the second quarter. it looks like your own sales volumes contracted between 16% and 19% between q2 and then q4. so, it looks like you lagged. you had worst contraction in the industry. can you talk about that? was that a strategic choice to help balance supply and demand? you had some plants that closed as part of that as well, maybe you can just talk about that, please.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's not a strategic choice to not sell product. we sold all the product we could. certainly, we took plants offline to get in front of what we saw, declining demand environment, which proved to be quite a good call in retrospect. and the only plants where we had total flexibility was chile iv and titan, and that's why we chose those plants.
if you look at the impact on us, we're underweight in china versus the rest of the world. china recovered in q2, while the rest of the world declined 19%. our larger exposure to asia pacific, europe and north america saw us decline more in q2 than the market. so, that's not unexpected based on our mix.
and mto saw growth in q2 and high operating rates. and we have less supply in mto in q2 as they, i think, switched to buy more iranian product that was being sold at a discount in china by up to $50 a ton during the quarter. so, we would have not chosen to compete at some of those mto accounts at those price levels. so, we chose not to sell. but we sold everything that we could that made sense for us.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. i had a question about turnaround. you talked about having some maintenance outages at both g1 and g2 in the second quarter. i believe you had a turnaround at g1 last year. maybe g2 was due. does this mean you don't need to do a turnaround at either g1 or g2 in the next couple of years? and then, do you have any other turnarounds planned -- any other plans this year?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
with g1, usually, we get four years between turnarounds, and so we did g1. and so, i don't expect to do a turnaround at g1 for three years. as far as g2, it hasn't had a turnaround yet since it started and you can do the math, joel. it's coming up to four years. so, i think that'll be due at some point, not too distant future.
the outages we took in q2 were really minor maintenance outages. pricing was low, demand was poor. so, we just took advantage of those conditions to make some minor corrections, to make those plants safer and more reliable over the medium-term.
we've always guided to two to three turnarounds per year. obviously, in the covid-19 environment, we had to delay some of our planned turnarounds at some of our plants. and assuming everything remains the way it is today, which is a big assumption, we plan to do those turnarounds in the second half of the year. but we're monitoring the spread of covid and our ability to get these turnarounds done safely and effectively in the current environment.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. and just finally, so you talked about the set of conditions you'll be looking at, whether it's to restart g3 in 14 or 15 months. let's just say that you come to a conclusion maybe around now that, you know what, you're not going to pursue g3 anymore. i'm sure you've gone back to look at your options here if you were to stop the project and penalties or how much payment you'd have to make or what you'd want to finish just to have ready to restart the project down the road. can you maybe just talk about, as much as you can, what flexibility, what options you have, how much you'd have to spend, what the penalties might be if you stop g3 now?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's early. we've said that to stop it when we made the decision just a quarter ago or to put it on care maintenance is about the same and we haven't changed our view on that. as we've announced that, we're obviously negotiating with all of our suppliers and different equipment, different construction labor, engineering, etc, etc, on all these different components.
i would also say we've had a number of equipment suppliers declare force majeure on us or interrupted because of covid-19. so, there's hundreds and hundreds of these contracts that are being negotiated back and forth. so, if we make the decision to not go forward with g3 sometime middle next year, we'll certainly highlight those costs that we would incur at that time.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from hassan ahmed. your line is open. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
john, if i heard you correctly, you talked about relative to end of last year's supply being down roughly 9%. so, my question to you is that, with the economics looking the way they are right now, could you venture a guess as to what percentage of that 9% will maybe potentially be permanently sort of curtailed? or do you think most of that supply is going to come online?
and then part and parcel with that, how are you thinking about the pace of near-term new capacity additions?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
so, we've highlighted two plants that we expected to be completed sometime this year. the yuhuang plant in the united states and the mitsubishi plant in trinidad. i think they total about $2.8 million. i think both are probably under some challenges in the current environment based on our experience with labor availability and how you have to manage your workforce in this type of environment. so, we think they'll start. they will start at some point, possibly delayed. but it's really hard for me to give you an exact on that, hassan.
as far as methanol supply that's offline, gone forever, really hard to predict. you know what we are going through in trinidad and our competitor has five plants there and the gas dynamics are really difficult. so, they've shut down some capacity. and whether that comes back or not, i think will be a factor of gas price and whether we and they can negotiate a gas price that makes sense through all points of the cycle of methanol. so, i think we'll have to watch that and see how that evolves. but it's really hard to predict where that's going to end up.
i think in other parts of the world, if pricing was to rebound to more normal methanol cycle levels, mid- 300s, we would expect that supply to come back on.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
very fair. very fair. and as a follow-up, john, maybe early days, but a lot of sort of news releases coming out about flooding at the yangtze river. so, what are you guys hearing in terms of, be it methanol output, as well as methanol trade that may or may not get impacted by this flooding that's being reported in the press.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i don't have anything to add on to that, hassan, sorry.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
okay. fair enough. thanks so much, john.
operator
thank you. the next question is from mike leithead. your line is open. please go ahead.
michael leithead -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael leithead -- barclays capital -- analyst
i have just two kind of higher level questions today. first, i believe methanex owns its own vessel fleet that i think is worth, call it, roughly $200 million on your balance sheet today. curious as you think about improving your financial flexibility in this environment, if you'd consider some sort of sale leaseback arrangement to help generate cash flow near-term or you would consider owning your own ships strategically important to where you are today with methanex?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
mike, we don't own them all. we have a combination of long-term time charters, which will be 15 years. some we own in partnership and some we have coas or contract of affreightment. so, there's a mix there. i'd say whether we own them or not is not crucial to waterfront shipping. we started owning a few vessels just to understand more around the operations. obviously, we wanted to promote methanol as alternative fuel. so, there were some strategic reasons.
it's an integral part of our overall supply chain. our competitive advantage is a secure, reliable supply to our customers and waterfront shipping is a key component of that. but i've said earlier, all options are on the table. but we want to preserve our balance sheet and enhance liquidity, but not destroy the future of the company at the same time.
so, i think these things will be ordered. and the ability to execute is also in this environment -- selling assets could be quite challenging in this environment. so, there's a number of factors, but we'll consider everything to protect our balance sheet and to enhance liquidity going forward.
michael leithead -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. and then, second question on the energy opportunity for methanol. i think there's been a lot of talk in investment in recent months around clean hydrogen. and earlier this month, there's a major hydrogen project announced in the middle east where effectively they're using ammonia as a transport medium to take the hydrogen gas to the end market. my understanding is someone could do something similar with methanol as a liquid hydrogen carrier for fuel cells.
so, i guess just between what's going on in clean hydrogen or even just direct fuel blending, can you just maybe update us on your thoughts on how you see methanol playing a part in this move toward clean fuel?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, methanol has always been a great hydrogen carrier. that's not news. we had a fuel cells project team going back 20 years ago, working with people like ballard for example. and that continues to go forward, not for automobiles in a big way, but for those smaller applications like generators, etc. so, still a very small part of overall demand. but as a hydrogen carrier, methanol is a great alternative. i'd say that kind of application is really a medium to longer term to build out the infrastructure, etc. so, certainly possible, but as far as impacting demand in the next five years, i would expect not.
operator
perfect. thank you. the next question is from john roberts. your line is open. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. i think it sounded like you were also curtailing new zealand a little bit going forward in the back half of the year. could you give us an update there?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, we're not curtailing new zealand at all. i think i guided last year that we expected our production to be 1.8 million tons in new zealand for the three plants based on gas availability in the country for 2020. we haven't changed that guidance at this time.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and i think there's been a shortage of plywood and particleboard. is formaldehyde at least a bright spot in the methanol market?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i know there's a shortage from -- not formaldehyde, but plywood and particleboard, and i think that's more of a factor of makers of those products curtail production in the second quarter as well. and for reasons that we think the renovation market is doing quite well, as people are hunkered down at home and trying to make their spaces more palatable as they have to be there all the time that that's created a short-term demand for those products, which is good for formaldehyde resins. absolutely.
but again, the amount of formaldehyde resin that goes into plywood in north america, while interesting, it's not going to move the needle from a demand point of view.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from steve hansen. your line is open. please go ahead.
steven hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. good morning, guys. just a couple of quick operational ones, john, if i may. just firstly on the maintenance schedule going forward. i know you're taking down maintenance capital for a year. just give us a sense for how much more flexibility there might be in that budget and whether you have any major turnarounds planned through the balance of the year. i know you don't give specific timing on those downtimes, so just trying to get a sense for whether we should expect any more disruptions.
and then, as a follow-up note or question just on the co2 levels that i think you noted in new zealand. just trying to get a sense for what's happening there.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, as far as turnarounds, we've guided to two to three per year. obviously, in the environment we found ourselves in the first half of this year, we couldn't do any turnaround. so, assuming conditions remain similar to how they are today, we'll proceed with our planned turnarounds for 2020. and we're going to obviously practice all of these safety things that we need to do today in social distancing, etc, etc, as we do these turnarounds.
there's a bit of room maybe to push them up a little bit if we need to because we can't conclude them safely. but there's limited ability to do so. these are statutory turnarounds that we need to change catalyst and do some maintenance work every three to four years. so, we have limited ability to further postpone these turnarounds, and you should expect us to do two to three a year in a normal environment.
and i didn't really understand the co2 question related to new zealand. are you talking about the high co2 gas or co2 emissions in the country?
steven hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
there was just a very brief comment in the md&a about co2 levels being slightly down. i wasn't too sure what that meant. i think it referred to the co2 gas.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
that was medicine hat, steve. yeah, we take co2 across the fence from a nitrogen plant and we have min/max rates in that and we decided to go to min rates on the co2 we were taking, which impacted our production there a little bit.
steven hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
understood. and then just one follow-up, if i may, is on trinidad. where are we at with the broader trinidad discussion and debates? we all know the backup there, but just trying to get a sense for how that broader discussion or negotiation is ongoing there in the country? what we can expect through the next 12 to 24 months? hello?
operator
we are sorry for the delay. we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. the conference will resume momentarily. thank you for standing by. all participants please standby, the conference will resume momentarily. once again, please continue to standby and we thank you for your patience. we are sorry for the delay. we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. the conference will resume momentarily. thank you for standing by.
all participants please continue to stand by. the conference will resume momentarily. thank you for standing by. we are sorry for the delay. the conference will resume momentarily. thank you for standing by.
mr. floren, this is the operator. can you hear us?
kim campbell -- director, investor relations
hello? methanex corporation is here.
operator
perfect. thank you. we are now ready to resume the conference. mr. steve hansen, you can repeat your question. please go ahead. your line is open.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
steve, are you there?
steven hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. hey, guys. thanks. didn't mean to break the call. i apologize. the question is really -- if you didn't hear it, i think we're all familiar with the background. but i just wanted to get a sense for the status of negotiations with the government there on gas supply. thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, we're negotiating, as we said, and we're looking to secure an arrangement that allows us to be somewhat profitable at all points of the cycle. and certainly, the ngc understands that and they're working hard to create the conditions to allow us to sign a deal with them that makes sense for us, makes sense for them and makes sense for the upstream. so, we have nothing to report today, but we will continue to negotiate. and we're not alone. there's others on the island in our business in methanol, as well as in fertilizer that are in the same conditions that we are. so, i think the government wants to have a solution to this issue and are working hard to make things happen to allow the island to continue to be a significant producer of methanol and ammonia. and again, we'll report as we have something to report. but right now, the plant is down, and you should expect it to come up here in the near term.
steven hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. much appreciated. thanks, guys.
operator
perfect. thank you. the next question is from matthew blair. your line is open. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning, john. i was hoping you can provide just a general update on what you're seeing with mto. there's been some chatter recently that mto really suffers in a low crude price environment. what kind of operates did you see in mto both in q2 as well as currently?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
quite high. it was one of the bright spots in the whole methanol demand environment in q2. so, we saw increasing rates of production as we had new plants year-over-year operating. we did see low pricing for ethylene and propylene, which could have impacted the demand, but we didn't see anybody turn off for economic reasons. so, i'd say mto continues to operate in that 90% range. we understand recently that one or two plants are doing some maintenance. one maybe planned, one maybe unplanned. but the number of plants that are running at a 90% operating rate is pretty good, and we continue to expect in the 80% to 90% going forward. and year-over-year, that gives us more demand because these plants weren't running all of 2019.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
sounds good. and then, the discount rate on the methanol contracts was quite high in q2. i think you referenced just falling methanol prices as the driver there. with methanol stabilizing, do you see that q3 discount rate getting closer to kind of like a long-term normalized level around 15% or so?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
what we've guided to when prizes are increasing, the discount will go down a bit. when prices are decreasing rapidly like we saw in q2, discount will go up. i think that's our highest discount since the financial crisis. when's the last time we had pricing of this order of magnitude? but our guidance is still applicable in a stable environment where prices are flat. we should experience around 15% discount. and q3 might be a little higher than that. it's early days, but that's still our guidance.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from roger spitz. your line is open. please go ahead.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks very much. just on that mto, a large chemical company on their q2 earnings call claimed mto isn't profitable below $50 a barrel. it's no doubt more complicated. you've said clearly the mto guys were operating at 90% just a moment ago. do you have -- i don't know how you feel about this $50 a barrel, but do you have a level where you think it isn't unprofitable or a way to think whether -- when it does become unprofitable?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
again, i've said this many times, each site is a little different. and when you calculate profitability for mto, you've got to look at all of the derivatives that are producing at any given site. it's not so much the oil price. it's more of the ethylene and the propylene prices. and for oil and, therefore, naphtha, to substitute, you'd have to have excess capacity of naphtha in order to do that, which is not there today. so, we've said clearly that growth in olefins is probably going to be in the form of ethane and naphtha in today's environment and not so much mto, and that's what we're planning for. but the existing capacity will continue to run, provided that they're cash positive on a site by site basis and that's the case today and that's why we see them running at high rates.
to make a prediction on the future, you'll have to tell me what the ethylene, the propylene and all the derivative prices will be, and then we could calculate the affordability for each and every site. so, i think it's a pretty basic analysis to say $50 oil below, they're all going to turn off. and i think history would show that's not the case.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from nelson ng. your line is open. please go ahead.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. my first question just relates to the working capital. i know that in q2, there's a big positive working capital move. i know $60 million of that was due to the insurance proceeds from egypt. but can you give a bit more color as to whether that will or whether a lot of that will reverse in the coming quarters or whether some of that's permanent?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i hope it does. that means we've got higher methanol prices. so, i'm cheering for the working capital draw to reverse.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so, most of that is just due to methanol -- driven by methanol prices rather than...
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, inventories of gas. just different things like that, but we'd like to see it go back up.
ian cameron -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, finance
we're operating our place, our company really tight right now. we are really trying to manage our working capital really well. so, that's -- we're going to keep a lid on that obviously. inventories, as john mentioned earlier, a little lower than they've been. and so, there's been some really good work in terms of managing our working capital. so, from this environment, we're going to probably stay there. as john said, if we get higher pricing, then it goes the other way which is a good news story.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. got it. and then, just on your credit facilities, i know you're sitting on a lot of cash. but i think during the quarter, you repaid $100 million in your revolver, but you drew down $37 million on your construction facility. can you just give a bit more color as to your strategy with your cash balance and your decision to draw things down? so, i'm just wondering why didn't you make a prepay all of your revolver? is there some risk that it won't be available in the future? is that why it's still drawn -- i think about $200 million is drawn right now?
ian cameron -- chief financial officer and senior vice president, finance
so, in terms of -- let me start with the construction loan and the $37 million draw. we're going to draw as we spend money on g3. we're entitled to. it's a fixed term loan. it's not a revolver. it's a non-revolving facility. so, we'll continue to do that.
and then, in terms of cash and liquidity, we're going have a balance in terms of how much cash we want, in terms of having it on the balance sheet versus the negative carry. and right now, as we've noted in the quarter, we've obtained really we think a good covenant release that allows us to get through the next few -- 12 months with lots of flexibility. so, we'll be evaluating over the next little while in terms of how much cash we'll keep on our balance sheet versus returning and repaying the operating facility. we haven't made any decisions yet.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks, ian. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. the next question is from eric petrie. your line is open. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citigroup -- analyst
hey. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citigroup -- analyst
with lower methanol prices, have you seen any increased demand for industrial boilers? or is methanol still less competitive versus either coal or gas?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, the switch to industrial boilers, methanol is really driven by cleaning up the air rather than straight economics. most of the boilers in china today are coal and they're quite polluting, especially on the coast. there's a drive to clean up the air.
so, three things you can do -- use instead of coal are methanol, natural gas and diesel fuel. and natural gas is not readily available throughout china. it's not like as reticulated system like we see here in north america. i think natural gas is a good choice to go to from coal, but a lot of areas that you can't get natural gas and i think that's where methanol plays its role.
so, i don't think whether methanol is at $200 or $300 a ton or if $400 a ton is going to make any impact on the switching rate of coal to methanol in the boiler market. it's more of a technology works; and methanol, i can get it delivered. so, it's more of a supply chain issue than actual price of methanol. we continue to see conversions not only on boilers, but more recently on kilns as well. so, coal-based kilns are starting to convert to those same three fuels. and we see that as a trend that will continue, especially as china looks to clean up its air.
eric petrie -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. so, my follow-up question i wanted to ask on the longer-term dynamics of marine fuel. i think lloyd's recently approved an ammonia fueled vessel. so, how do you see methanol competing against ammonia and meeting imo 2030 standards?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, methanol is a great alternative fuel and will meet the imo standards going forward. and the thing about it is easy to handle. it's readily available in all parts around the world. it can be stored in regular tanks that are on the ships. so, from a storage and handling and availability, it checks all those boxes.
but i've always said, it's not going to be either or. it's going to be a number of solutions that people are going to promote including lng and ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the short term. and methanol and ammonia has been used in diesel trucks in north america for quite some time. so, i think it will -- it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. and we're pretty pleased with the progress that we're making on methanol as a fuel on board ships.
the nice thing i think that methanol has an advantage is it's flexible. so, you can have the same engine use ultra-low-sulfur diesel or methanol. so, to me, any time you can provide flexibility on fuel of choice, that gives you a leg up on your competition. so, we would continue to see methanol as a fuel on ships growing again significantly, probably mid next decade -- mid this decade because it's mainly a newbuild story. retrofitting, we don't think is going to happen. people will just probably use ultra-low-sulfur diesel, especially in the current environment.
eric petrie -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. how would you size the market opportunity in terms of tons?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
if every ship was to convert to methanol, which it is not, it is about 500 million tons. so, we don't need very much penetration to have a significant impact on the supply/demand balance for methanol. so, a ship like ours, one of our ships, just to give you order of magnitude, they're about 50,000 deadweight tons. if they run on methanol 100% of the time, it's about 10,000 tons to 12,000 tons of methanol per year per ship.
eric petrie -- citigroup -- analyst
great. thank you, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the last question is from cherilyn radbourne. your line is open. please go ahead.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning. in terms of the new methanol supply that's scheduled to come online, could you just give some color around what sort of logistical issues you think covid-19 could have in terms of the timing of those plants coming online?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's really around construction. if you've ever been to a large plant that's being constructed, people are working in pretty close quarters. so, you have to put in quite a bit of safety procedures that you wouldn't normally put in without a virus around, social distancing, masks, cleaning, all the things that are being done everywhere that we see covid present in a big way. so, that adds time and probably adds people.
and then, you've got the commissioning process. usually, when you're commissioning a plant, you're bringing people in from all different parts of the world that have expertise in a particular piece of equipment or a particular system or a particular part of the plant. and i think in trinidad today, that's pretty difficult. in the united states, maybe a bit easier, but maybe some people don't want to travel, they're going to do it remotely, and that will add complications.
so, i think not only will construction times be extended, but commissioning could be a lot harder than in a normal environment. but i'm always amazed at what people are able to do when they don't have a choice of being in person. so, people will find ways and -- but i think it will be a bit more cost and probably a bit longer, is what i would anticipate. but those plants will get commissioned at some point here in the coming year or two.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
okay. and then, last one for me, can you comment on what you're seeing as far as the impact of the sanctions on iran and the flows of iranian methanol?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
really, no impact on their ability to produce. i think the impact of sanctions is more on getting spare parts and developing the gas fields to allow them to deliver gas on a reliable level throughout the year. so, we're still continuing to see methanol being shipped. and really, the only place it can be sold is china. now, india is back open, so there's some going to india and we've seen pricing rebound in india as a result. so, i'd say it's more not the ability to sell the methanol, but it is at a discount to other material, but they're still selling it. it's the production and the ability to run their plants reliably going forward.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for the time, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. we don't have any other questions at this time. i'll turn the meeting back to...
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you. so, just a couple of clarifying points. i think i mentioned the extension on the g3 completion was 12 months. it's really nine months. so, it's now july 2023. i apologize, joel, for being off by three months. and we have a crack finance team here. so, during the call, i didn't realize this, but we have a covid-19 category for all expenses that are in addition to our normal operating costs related to covid-19. and so far today, it's $37,000, so just to answer that question. thanks to the finance team for providing that information. i wanted to reiterate that our top priority is keeping our team members safe and healthy. we will continue to operate our plants safely and reliably, deliver secure and reliable supply to our customers, and protect our balance sheet. we believe we're well positioned to sustain our business in this uncertain environment and generate significant long-term value as global market conditions recover.
thank you for joining us today. stay safe and we look forward to connecting with you in october. thank you for the interest in our company.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation q3 2020 earnings call.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead.
kim campbell -- investor relations
good morning, everyone. welcome to our third quarter 2020 results conference call. our 2020 third quarter news release management's discussion and analysis and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcomes to differ materially from the actual outcome. certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projections, which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our third quarter 2020 md&a and to our 2019 annual report for more information.
i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex's future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters. for clarification, any references to revenue, ebitda, cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflects our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility. in addition, we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this matter.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's president and ceo, mr. john floren, for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. we hope that everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy. in the third quarter, we continued to demonstrate the resilience of our business through this difficult time. our manufacturing operations and global supply chain have run safely and effectively throughout the pandemic, which has enabled us to deliver on our commitment of secure and reliable supply to our customers around the world. we'd like to express our appreciation to our team members across the globe who have demonstrated their ongoing commitment and agility this year. this morning, we will comment on our q3 results, provide an overview of what we're seeing in the methanol markets and discuss how we tie it to our business in this challenging environment, including additional steps that we've recently taken to increase liquidity and and preserve financial flexibility through this uncertain time and emerge stronger when market conditions further improve. now i'll turn to the third quarter results. we recorded adjusted ebitda of $40 million, which was higher than the second quarter as a result of higher average realized price, which was partially offset by lower sales of methanex produced product and higher costs.
we recorded an adjusted net loss of $79 million or $1.03 per share in the third quarter, higher compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the onetime finance charge of $15.4 million related to the early repayment of our $250 million unsecured notes that were due in march 2022. excluding this onetime finance charge, we would have recorded an adjusted net loss of $68 million or $0.88 per share. now turning to the methanol market. we estimate that global methanol demand increased by approximately 9% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter as economic activity rebounded around the world and methanol demand recovered across all regions and end-use markets. globally, demand for traditional chemical applications improved as manufacturing activity recovered particularly in the automotive and construction industries. demand for energy-related applications, including mtbe, biodiesel and other fuel applications improved as ground transportation and fuel demand saw some recovery. methanol-to-olefin demand has remained strong throughout 2020. while demand has recovered in the third quarter of 2020, global demand -- global methanol demand in the year through q3 2020 remains 3% lower than the comparable year-to-date period in 2019 and below pre-covid expectations for 3% to 4% growth.
on an annual basis, we estimated the forecast demand in 2020 will be lower than the 2019 by three million tonnes versus pre co ed expectations for three million tonnes of growth. as a result, we estimate that 2020 global demand will be six million tonnes lower than pre-covid forecast, reflecting the demand destruction resulting from the pandemic. global methanol industry supply declined in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter due to various plans and unplanned outages and planned shutdowns to respond to lower methanol demand. our titan plant in trinidad remains idle while our chile iv plant, which has been idle since april 1, is in the process of restarting. overall, the combination of increased methanol demand and lower industry supply has tightened global inventory levels and move methanol prices higher. we estimate that the industry cost curve, which continues to be set in china, is approximately $200 to $240 per tonne. spot prices in china are above this range today. as a result of the tighter market conditions, our posted prices for october and november increased. we recently posted our november north american price, which increased by 13% to $379 per tonne, and our asia pacific price, which increased to $310 per tonne. our european contract price is set quarterly, and our fourth quarter posted price is eur275 or $320 per tonne. now turning to our operations. our production levels were lower in the third quarter as we undertook planned maintenance activities at our medicine hat facility and our atlas facility in trinidad. in new zealand, our production levels were lower in the third quarter, a result of lower gas deliveries as previously forecasted. we expect to receive higher gas deliveries in the fourth quarter.
in geismar, both of our plants ran at full operating rates during the third quarter. we completed our low capital cost, geismar one debottlenecking project to increase our production capacity by approximately 10% or 100,000 metric tonnes per year and expect to ramp up to our new full production capability for geismar one over the coming weeks. in trinidad, we commenced the planned turnaround at our atlas facility toward the end of the quarter and expect to resume production in early november. our titan facility remains idle in negotiations with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago for a long-term gas agreement continue. in chile, our production levels were lower in the third quarter as we received lower natural gas deliveries during the southern hemisphere winter months. the natural gas supplies are needed for residential heating. as global methanol demand is improving, we are in the process of restarting our chile iv plant. in egypt, our plant ran at nearly full operating rates. in medicine hat, our production levels were lower as we commenced the planned turnaround in august 2020 and subsequently completed at the end of october. now we'll turn to our balance sheet. in the current unprecedented environment impacted by both covid-19 and challenging commodity prices, the path and pace for global economic recovery, the methanol demand remain uncertain. we believe that it's prudent to plan for a wide range of scenarios, including the possibility of a prolonged period of lower methanol demand and lower ethanol prices.
we have taken a series of actions in 2020 to preserve liquidity and improve financial flexibility during this uncertain time, including deferring approximately $500 million in capital spending on our geismar three project, reducing our dividend by approximately $100 million on an annual basis, suspending share buybacks, reducing maintenance capital and operating costs and updating covenant relief on our credit facilities. in addition, in mid-september, we issued $700 million in 2027 notes to repay existing debt and increase our liquidity and financial flexibility with limited impact on our leverage metrics. we have repaid the $200 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. and in late september, we issued an early redemption notice to repay our existing $250 million bond that was originally due in march 2022. the cash flow impact of early bond repayment will be reflected in our fourth quarter results. the remaining $250 million is available to provide additional liquidity. we have no other debt maturities until late 2024. during the third quarter, we also secured additional flexibility under our revolving credit and geismar three construction facilities related to the minimum ebitda to interest coverage ratio covenant through to december 31, 2021. a prior waiver had provided covenant release until june 30, 2021.
the steps that we have taken in 2020 to increase liquidity and improve our financial flexibility position us well to navigate through this uncertain time and generate significant long-term value and market conditions further improve. we are pleased to see recent early signs of economic recovery, including improvement in methanol demand and prices. nevertheless, we continue to evaluate all options to preserve liquidity and improve financial flexibility as necessary. now i'd like to turn briefly to our geismar three project. as we've noted before, our geismar three project is a high-quality project with substantial capital and operating cost advantages and has been significantly derisked. in april 2020, we placed the project on temporary care and maintenance for up to 18 months, given the significant uncertainty regarding the global economy due to covid-19. the project was in excellent shape and progress had been safe, on time and on budget, and the head project had been significantly derisked. we deferred approximately $500 million of capital expenditures with the expected spending during the temporary care and maintenance period reduced to only the costs that we were already committed and the completion of activities that preserve the flexibility to complete the future -- the project in the future, such as certain key engineering activities and procurement of critical path equipment. construction on the geismar three project remains on hold, and the various factors today do not currently support restarting construction. we want to be clear that we have a robust decision-making process for evaluating the project, and there are many factors at management and our board will need to consider carefully before restarting construction, including the global economic recovery and the methanol demand outlook, the methanol industry's needs for new capacity.
the methanol price forecast the ability to fund the project and our suppliers' ability to complete construction and deliver material and equipment on time and on budget in light of any covid-19 restrictions. we will continue to review and monitor these factors as we continue to evaluate g3. we continue to explore partnership arrangements for the project. now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. we expect that the outlook over the coming months to continue to be untethered. we cannot predict the full impact of covid-19 pandemic on the methanol market. based on our posted prices so far, we expect average realized prices in the fourth quarter to be higher than the third quarter. we expect that our production levels in the fourth quarter will be higher compared to the third quarter as we've completed our planned maintenance activities in medicine hat and trinidad. we are in the process of restarting our chile iv plant, and we expect to receive higher gas deliveries in new zealand compared to q3. we expect adjusted ebitda to be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. as we look forward toward next year, we are updating our guidance on a couple of items starting in 2021. we expect selling, general and administrative costs to be flat in 2021 compared to 2020 as we continue to focus on our low-cost strategy.
and we expect our maintenance capital guidance in 2021 to be approximately $120 million, which is consistent with our revised maintenance capital guidance for 2020. before we pause for questions, we'd like to highlight a couple of points about the resiliency of our business. while the near-term outlook is uncertain, we continue to believe that the long-term methanol industry supply and demand fundamentals are strong. methanol is a key chemical building block that is used to produce a variety of everyday consumer and industrial items. methanol is also used in a growing number of clean burning and economic alternative energy applications. we expect that demand for methanol rebound and grow as global economic activity recovers. as a global methanol industry leader with a network of production facilities around the world, an integrated global supply chain and low-cost structure, our competitive advantage of delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers around the world remains intact. we have strong cash flow potential with significant leverage to methanol prices. we estimate that every $10 increase in our average realized price translates into approximately $60 million increase in adjusted ebitda on an annual basis. we remain focused on operating our plants safely and reliably, delivering secure, reliable supply to our customers and strengthening our business by preserving liquidity and improving financial flexibility. we are well positioned to navigate through this uncertain time and emerge stronger when market conditions improve.
we would now be happy to answer any questions.

[operator instructions] the first question is from ben isaacson of scotiabank. please go ahead.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. john, i just wanted to understand, first of all, the dynamics that you're seeing between q3 and q4. so obviously, in q3, we had strong demand recovery. mto rates were high. we had limited supply because of outages, the turnarounds, hurricane lora, etc. but now as we kind of go get halfway to q4, we're starting to see lockdown increase, mto economics are starting to move a little bit lower. we're seeing seasonal slowdown in construction and supply is coming back. so do you think that q4 could be a little bit weaker than q3 in terms of supply and demand?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i don't predict the future. i can tell you what we see is that supply continues to be constrained. there is a plant that's being commissioned in trinidad that has not really delivered a lot of product into the market yet. we understand there's another new plant in the united states. so it will be commissioned sometime over the next few quarters. and we expect to continue to see demand recovery in q4 based on where we are in our forecast for the quarter. but that could be impacted by further shutdowns, as you've mentioned. so i can't predict our competitors' plans if they're going to have unplanned outages or not. what i would say is that these plants need ongoing maintenance.
and in the covid-19 environment, it's very difficult to do regular maintenance, never mind turnarounds, we've just experienced ourselves doing a couple of them. so i think it's hard to predict. but i think q2, what we see is the bottom now, but it's really depending on demand recoveries and what you see for demand. when we talk to our european customers today, even with lockdowns, their demand still seems to be ok, but that could change very quickly. so in this environment, i'm really not going to predict what might happen in one or two quarters to come.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
and john, my follow-up question is on the dividend. obviously, liquidity is vastly improved. you're now prepaying debt a couple of years out. when you think about the dividend, is it your hope that you will reinstate the dividend back to what it originally was? or you'll kind of assess it at the time? how are you thinking about that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, hope is not a strategy. i think as we generate excess cash, our first use for that cash will be to repair our balance sheet and to get our debt leverage metrics back to investment-grade kind of ratings. beyond that, our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. three pillars to take excess cash to grow the company, in line with the market. if we have projects that meet or exceed our hurdle rate of 13% return on capital employed, have a meaningful, sustainable growing dividend and return excess cash beyond that to shareholders through share repurchases. so nothing's changed in our strategy, and we'll see how our cash generation develops here in the global pandemic, and you should expect us to follow that strategy going forward. thank you very much.

thank you. the next question is from joel jackson of bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
robin -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
this is robin [phonetic] on for joel. so my first is on g3. so for it to be restarted, would you need confidence that free cash flow would be positive, including the g3 capex during the remaining construction period?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think what i've said is we have to have the ability to finance that project. and without a partner, there's still about $900 million after what we'll spend in the care and maintenance period that we'll have to figure out how to finance. so there's a lot of different options on how we do that, and we haven't made any decisions.
robin -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. for my follow-up, what production level at new zealand can be supported by the higher gas deliveries in q4? and will the upstream gas projects that's going on in the country right now allow for more normalized production in 2021?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i guided this time last year that we were expecting gas curtailments in new zealand during 2020, and that's what we've seen, covid or no covid. so we had guided to 1.8 million tonnes for 2020, and we're going to be a little lower than that, probably 1.7 as there was a bit more activity than we had been told early -- or this time last year, it's still about 100,000 less for the year in new zealand. and next year, we should get back to that 1.8. but the ongoing activity that we see gives us good certainty that we'll continue to see better gas deliveries in the future from new zealand. but next year, i think i'll guide to about 1.8.

jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst

john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
on how far can you defer g3 without further financial penalties?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
we're looking at all options regarding g3, and we don't have any decisions in front of us today. we've put it on care and maintenance for up to 18 months. so our team are working hard to negotiate all the various contracts that we have related to g3 to give us the maximum flexibility that we could hope for in this very uncertain environment. so we're continuing to talk to our various partners where we've made commitments, and everybody is experiencing similar that we are with all this uncertainty. and i think our partners are being flexible, but i really don't have any numbers to share, and we're focused on the 18-month care and maintenance and see how markets develop between now and then.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
but to be clear, after 18 months, or if you continue to delay this project, there will be some financial penalties
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't commit to that today. we're negotiating with our suppliers. we may -- we have different options to consider. so i don't -- i think there'll be some commitments that we'll have to pay for, but it's too early to tell how much that might be.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
okay. and then just in regards to chile iv, what methanol price do you need to break even there?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
what methanol price? well, i don't give breakeven prices a plant by plant basis, jacob, for competitive reasons, obviously. i would say the gas prices that we're seeing in that southern part of the world are very similar to what we're seeing in the united states. and most of the products that we'd be making if chile iv would be going to asia. so whatever assumptions you have for conversion in freight, you can figure it out.

thank you. the next question is from steve hansen of raymond james. please go ahead.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
oh. hey, guys. just a follow-up one on chile, if i may. was curious, john, i think in the past, you had guided toward chile being in a position to do roughly 75% utilization on two plants. that was prior to chile iv shutdown, obviously. are we to assume that that's going to be a similar type range now going forward once chile iv is up and running? or how should we think about that cadence?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. assuming that the world needs the product, the guidance hasn't changed. i mean the only two plants we had flexibility on take-or-pay gas was chile iv and trinidad, and that's why we decided to shut those plants down our guidance was 75% on an annualized basis for two plant operation and how that was structured was think of chile iv running six to eight months a year and shut down during their winter period, which we're just coming out of and chile i running at full rates, except for their winter period. and on average, that should get us to about 75%. we haven't run both plants at full rates for any extended period. so we're not really sure of the total nameplate capacity. once they're integrated. so we have a bit of discovery still to do, but we still believe, based on our current gas contracts, current gas availability throughout the year, that guidance is still good, but it will be smooth 75% throughout the year. during their winter period, our summer period, you should expect chile i to run at lower than full rates in chile iv to be down.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and if i may then, just as a follow-up on the operational side. the atlas turnaround strikes me as being quite extended this period, but i think you suggested in the release that it was started in september and it will be back up and running in november. but if you look at the utilization rates that it ran at during the third quarter, it was also quite low. so is there anything to read into that? or is it just the turnaround took longer than expected? or how should we think about that process?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there's lots to read into that. we had scheduled a turnaround in atlas and medicine hat early in the year and due to covid-19, we couldn't do it. i think you know, steve, that you've been at these plants, the catalyst degradates over time and especially in an oxygen based plant. so every month that goes by, you don't change out of that catalyst, your operating rate is impacted, and that's what we've seen in atlas. and we're kind of crawling along to try and get this turnaround done, the oxygen-based plants catalyst change a little bit more frequently than the regular steam reformer plan. so we are lucky that we had a window to complete the turnaround.
it's about 45 days, give or take, and we're pretty well complete, and we'll be starting it up in the coming days. so i'm really proud of our team down there and our team in medicine hat for really getting these turnarounds done in very difficult environments, especially with the covid-19 protocol. so i'm glad we're not having any more this year to do in this environment or even constructing in g3. i think it would be a challenge that we've seen in that part of the world, plants that are under construction are delayed and cost overrun because of the covid-19 protocols, etc. so yes, i'm pretty happy with what we've done in medicine hat in atlas.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst

good morning.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
maybe just picking up on that discussion about the difficulty undertaking turnarounds in this environment. maybe you can give us some color on some of the major challenges and your perspective on the extent to which you think the industry may be behind on maintenance as a result?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think everybody is behind on maintenance. i mean, when you are down to minimum staffing levels at plants, instead of 150 on site, you might have 55. so you're just doing the stuff that you absolutely have to do to keep the plant running safely. when you do a turnaround, you're bringing between 1,000 to 1,800 people on to a site in a six to 10-week period. so you can imagine in a covid-19 environment with all the protocols of distancing, testing, masks, a lot of these jobs are in confined space environments, really collaborative, a lot of teamwork and a lot of focus on safety. so you're having people looking at safety all the time, and all of this has to be done at a distance. and then manpower availability. we don't talk about that, but you have contractors that you sign up for that guarantee or in their contracts, say, we're going to have x number of bodies available for this particular job, and then you get half that amount for a job. so that leads to lots of complications.
as at any time, covid or no covid, our focus is on safety. and in a covid environment, it's a lot more complicated, it takes longer. and in medicine hat, we had an outbreak. so that further complicated things. this disease, i don't think, is still well understood, and it seems to spread a lot quicker than we first thought. so we are always overly cautious about keeping our team and our contractors safe. so it adds to cost in the fact that you have longer time to do the same amount of jobs. you have less available contractors. so at that adds time and just the protocol that's time and people. so it's a really difficult environment. if you do it properly and you really follow the safety protocols and guidelines that are put out by the various governments to get any significant maintenance, never mind construction work done.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful color. separately, and with regard to mto demand, as i'm sure you're aware, there's been some talk about potential mtp restarts. and i was just hoping you could give us methanex' perspective on that.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'm not as bullish in this one as argus is, and that's usually i'm more bullish than argus. so it's interesting. but it'd be a nice surprise if it happens. our team there is looking at it and following it very closely, but hasn't happened yet, lots of talk, but it would be a nice little demand driver if it does happen. i personally don't think it's sustainable based on the economics of just making propylene from methanol, but that's my personal view and we'll continue to follow that market.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst

thank you. the next question is from john roberts of ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you, john. back to your maintenance comments there. do you have a gut feel for how much of the industry supply is perhaps reduced by lower catalyst activity broadly in longer downtimes when people are doing maintenance, it take 1%, 2% out of the total global supply availability?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i'd be guessing, john, i don't like to guess. i can tell you with atlas, as you get to end the life of catalyst, it goes down pretty fast. i think our operating rates before we took the turnaround were 80% versus 100%. so doesn't take long as the catalyst aggregates to reduce operations quite significantly. anecdotally, i think some of the outages we've seen in q3 planned or unplanned have been related to maintenance, but that's normal. and i guess every different country has different protocols on how they do, covid-19 contract -- or sorry, social distancing and masks. so i think every country is a little difficult. but in general, i think maintenance has been deferred. and i think as you do plan turnarounds or unplanned maintenance, it's going to take longer. probably a little bit more expensive, but i don't really have a number i can share with you off the top of my head.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and do you have any thoughts on north american natural gas prices over the next several quarters, the financial markets were obviously preparing for higher gas prices?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm not an expert on gas, but what i know is there's lots of gas. and i'd say $4 and below, there's probably lots of gas for a long time. so i've seen it being very volatile. and i don't know if that's a factor of deliveries or system issues, i'm not sure, john. so it's a bit out of my area of expertise.

jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
just one quick clarification. the $100 million you mentioned over the next 12 months. some of that, i'm assuming, is one-time to finish up stuff. but how should i think about that long term, if this ends up being in care maintenance for more than 12 months?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
again, we've given an 18-month period of care maintenance, given guidance around how much we would spend, including the commitments we've already made. and then we're looking at if we have to further delay or on a like on a year or longer basis, what that might entail. we don't have any numbers to share with you today because we're in negotiations with all of our partners on that project, and it's too early to make that call. so we have 18 months of care and maintenance for the prices that we've -- about $100 million more to go for a total around $300 million to $400 million and -- or $400 million, and then we'll have another $900 million to go to finish the project. and that $900 million could change depending on what timing we're looking at to complete that project, if we have to put it on longer hold or temporary further hold or go forward. and we haven't made any decisions around that yet. and we want to see how methanol markets evolve and give you the five conditions we're looking at to restart that project.
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay. the other question is in your compare quarter-over-quarter, your discount to -- so your realized price improved whereas your benchmark price declined. so the discount clearly was reduced. can you talk about what sets the factors for this discount? and is that something that is sort of forecastable? or is it just based on what you're doing in the quarter?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
our guidance is 15% discount on average. and what we've said is when prices are increasing rapidly, that discount tends to narrow. and when prices are decreasing rapidly, it tends to expand, and you would have seen that in our results since 2018 when we've had both of those events occur. and in the quarter, we probably had fairly stable at a very low price pricing, which led to that 15%. we're looking at right now renewing our contracts for next year for a good chunk of our business. i would say there's a lot more intense rivalry out there today. in placing volume because of the environment we are, and that could impact discounts. and when we have something to update, we'll do so, and probably, we'll look to update our guidance on discounts in the january call.

eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
a fertilizer company this morning announced a goal they have 1/3 of its ammonia production will be low carbon. are your customers demanding greener methanol, especially into the fuels market? and then could you address the long-term enthusiasm from methanol into maritime transportation demand?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so some of our customers are asking us for green methanol, as we call it. and obviously, want to pay the same as what we call regular methanol from natural gas, which the economics are quite different. when you make methanol from a noncarbon natural gas, like we're doing in iceland. i'll remind you, we have a project in iceland that we've invested in that takes co2 off of a power plant, takes water through electrolysis, makes hydrogen and oxygen, the oxygen goes in the air, we use the hydrogen to make methanol and that's so-called green methanol which has no carbon. so it's possible, very expensive and hard to scale it. these plants would be in the order of magnitude of 25,000 to 50,000 would be a big one and a big methanol plant from gas is 1.8. so you'd have to make a lot of these all over the world, a lot of capital involved and probably the price you'd need is $800, $900 a tonne to make a goal of it. well, our customers -- some of our customers would like to see non-carbon or green methanol, but they're not prepared to pay $800 to $900 a tonne today on -- for a lot of volume. maybe there's some niche applications that could work where they want to take advantage of some of the government subsidies around credits, etc. but that's not a way to build a business on government subsidies and credits. so we've been looking at this for a long time, and we've been looking at the various technologies, and it does work.
does it work at scale? i think that's a question mark, and our -- is the market prepared to pay today for what the price would needed to have significant volume, and i would say no. so we'll continue to look at it, and we're -- there's lots of other things we can do. and including in louisiana using natural gas that's made from a 0 carbon source and using that through our plant we can then have 0 carbon methanol. so -- but these are i'd say very small volumes today, but who knows how far this could go in the future and what the willingness of customers to pay for the green methanol is. i think it's early days. as far as onboard ships, yes, we're seeing a lot of interest in onboard ships. our competitor has ordered a couple of ships that will be able to run on methanol or ultra-low sulfur diesel. and we continue to see a lot of interest. but i'd say, i've always said methanol to run ships, although we've proven out the technology from a significant demand driver, it's probably a mid- decade issue, not tomorrow, not 2022, but i'd say the positives there is the technology works. we've proven that the efficiencies are there. the emissions reductions are there. no impact on the engines and the fact that it's flexible that you can switch from ultra-low sulfur diesel to methanol. all of that's been proven. so i think that's exciting and groundbreaking and could be a significant demand driver as we get into the second half of the decade, but still early days.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
i appreciate that color. and then from my follow-up question, you noted that covid and the pandemic had eliminated six million tonnes of methanol demand. so how quickly do you see that ramping back up into the next few years? and then could you just give a breakdown of where you see industry utilization by region?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'll have to get back to you on industry utilization by region. i keep a lot in my brain, but i don't keep that. so kim will get back to you on that one. as far as methanol demand recovery, i mean, if you can tell me, country by country, what governments are going to do to deal with a global pandemic, i could give you a number. but governments have been very inconsistent with their approach, and in my opinion, have been somewhat reactionary. so i don't know what governments are doing. certainly, france is now shutting down and germany is shutting down and other governments are letting things be wide open. so i think this pandemic or this covid-19 virus is going to be with us for a long time. a vaccine will eventually be developed and it will take some time to inoculate everybody, and we'll maybe get back to somewhat of a new normal, but i think this is going to be with us for a long time, and that's why we've tried to build in as much liquidity and financial flexibility as we can to be ready for all possible scenarios, including reduced demand again and whatever we might be seeing from covid-19 pandemic.

nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning everyone.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
just a quick question. you mentioned that titan and chile iv were the plants with the most flexible, i guess, gas supply arrangements. and now you're restarting chile iv, but i guess when we look at various scenarios, like if there's another drop or material drop in the methanol price, is there a lot of flexibility to, i guess, wind down chile iv sometime over the next, like, two quarters? and if methanol prices continue to move higher, are we really looking at titan? or are there other facilities where you can -- where you'll look to try to squeeze up more production?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
we try to run our plants at full rates all the time. so if they're not running at full rates, it's usually as a result of gas not being fully available, like we're seeing in new zealand. but our goal is to run our plants at full rates. so chile iv, again, we have total flexibility there. so based on our current look for supply demand, we're not bringing it up for a couple of months. we're bringing it up -- we think we'll be able to run it right through until the next time we need to shut it down, which is as they come into their winter time, which is the spring -- or spring next year. so we expect to run that plant for a good six months. so we're not thinking of bringing it up to shutting it down, but we would have the flexibility to do so if things got really dire again, but that's not our current view. so you should expect us to run chile iv right up till their winter time next year is our current thinking. as far as titan, i think we took it down. we don't have a gas contract that allows us to be cash positive through the cycle.
there's a lot of uncertainty out there with methanol demand and supply. so i would say, i never wanted to make black and white statements, but it would be difficult for us to restart that plant without some certainty around a gas contract for the foreseeable future. once you take the plant down for a significant amount of time like we have, there's quite a bit of cost involved in restarting it. so unless we have some certainty around gas because we're not that certain around methanol markets and pricing, it would be difficult for us to start it up. but if we were to start it up, i think we get a lot of comfort in higher methanol prices for a longer time, which means to me a demand recovery and some sort of stabilization as a result of covid-19, but i don't see that in the next one or two quarters in our current year.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i see. so just for titan, if you were to restart it, obviously, there was a bunch of start-up costs. and from your perspective, would you -- would titan have to run for like at least a year or two to kind of make that in order for that to make sense?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm not going to put any lines in the sand. i think we don't want to go back to a month-to-month pricing arrangement is what i would say, which is what we had from january to april when we shut it -- march to when we shut it down. so we're negotiating, and we're still optimistic we'll get something done with the government. but until we do, i think in our planning, to be very optimistic to bring titan up in this environment.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just on a follow-up, can i just talk about the cash on the balance sheet. obviously, there's about $1.2 billion of cash. and you're due to repay the 2022 debt, i guess, soon. but how should we think of the cash on the balance sheet? is this something you're looking to kind of hold on to? or are you kind of in the process of making some decisions on what to do with that cash in terms of whether you like repay the construction facility or i guess, any other potential uses?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
preserving liquidity and financial flexibility are our top priority right now. so we'll continue to look at how markets develop. i think the good news, based on our current forecast pricing for q4, we'll be cash positive again after maintenance and dividend and all the things. so we won't be eating into cash. so i think that's really good news. but is that sustainable? i'm not prepared to put my hand up and say that yet, but i think we'll leave that cash there to allow us flexibility and depending on how markets develop, we'll be good stewards of cash, like we always have. we're not going to hoard it. and if we get to a place where we see things where we can generate a lot of cash. and just remind you of $300 a tonne, which is not too far from where we are today on a realized basis, we generate a nice amount of free cash. so too early to be making decisions around that, and our goal is to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. i'll leave it there.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
john, wanted to revisit a comment you made earlier around august and argus talking about certain mtp facilities coming online. i mean i too was quite surprised by that, particularly keeping in mind. some of these propane dehati facilities that are coming online in china. so again, on the mtp side, i mean, do you really think any of those facilities are going to come online? and then parling onto that, what are your views about the mto operating rates as you look into 2021? i completely understand demand is uncertain right now because of the pandemic. but just on the supply side, i mean, there's just so much ethylene capacity that seems to be coming online in china, it came online this year, continues to come online regardless of what the demand picture looks like. so how are you thinking about the mtp restart and mto operating rates in 2021?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our view on mto hasn't changed. i mean we said the first wave was going to get built and run, and that's what's happened. i mean, they've been running throughout the pandemic under less than $400 ethylene at 90% rates, unless there's been a technical issue. nobody that we know has been taken down for so-called economic reasons that i read about in argus all the time. and through the pandemic, it was probably the one demand source that was steady. so that's pretty interesting. and that has always been our view based on talking to them is once these get built, they're integrated, and they'll probably run. they may take maintenance at different times of the year. these are fully integrated projects. but they need the ethylene propylene to make all their derivatives and that they're selling every day in the market. and some of these sites make 10 products, some make four really depends on the site. so the economics of running or not running are different for each and every site. and that's what we look at. we don't just look at methanol price and then what is propylene and ethylene trading. and i think that's a very simple model that doesn't really capture the full economic value of the site in any given mto project. so we've said that consistently. and i think history has proven us right up to now.
that doesn't mean we'll be right in the future. i don't predict the future. but we talk to them, we look at their operating rates. and 90%, we think is full rate just because there are always going to be a turnaround or some sort of technical and these are large demand users of methanol, an average plant might use 1.8 million tonnes. so have a 30 or 60-day outage, that really impacts the overall operating rates. i think there are 13 sites or something like that. so they're big. and when they go down, they have an impact on methanol demand. so around 85% to 90% is what we would guide to. and i think that's what we'll see. if they ran at that rate at less than $400 ethylene, then why wouldn't they in the future, but we'll see how it turns out. mtp, that to me is really economic methanol to propylene, and then you're competing with pdh and crackers and ethane crackers and naphtha crackers and maybe short term, it could make sense to make some short-term cash, but i really don't see it sustainable. that's what we were told back in 2016 when the four plants went down because of the oil collapse last time and pdh and propylene price collapsing, that's what we were told. is there some conditions today that may make sense to make a bit of cash for some time? i don't know. i just don't see it sustainable, but in this one, i hope i'm wrong. i hope they come up all four of them, they run forever. that would be great. but i'm not counting on that in my forecast.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
very fair, very clear. and as a follow-up, john, medium to longer term, i guess, it's a struggle to even think about anything beyond the pandemic, but medium to longer-term with the volatility that we've seen in methanol prices, i mean what are you guys seeing in terms of some of these sort of greenfield capacity addition announcements that had been made? are you seeing sort of delays, cancellations? i mean sort of longer term, let's say, four, five years out, how are you guys thinking about, call it, a supply growth cagr or however you may think about supply growth?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think it's a great point. in this environment, it's very difficult to be running plants today, never mind building new ones. so our current view is the trinidad plant will get running well and providing product at some point it here in the coming quarters. the yuhon [phonetic] plant will get finished and we'll run and provide methanol. beyond that, there's no shovels in the ground. so there's a few projects, i think, in russia and, some new supply in china that will displace existing production. and then the big wild card is iran. there's been plants under construction in iran for a long time. and plants that -- according to argus been running, which we haven't -- we watched the shipments out of iran.
that's how we know how much they're producing, because there's not a lot of demand within iran, and it hasn't changed all that much. so that, to me, is the big wildcard, how much production do we get out of iran in the next three to five years, and i don't have an answer for that, but we'll continue to watch it. but beyond that, there's not going to be, in my view, a lot of willingness to lend a bunch of money to this industry to build more methanol plants in this environment, especially since '16, we've seen tremendous volatility. and since '09, we've had now in just over 10 years, three very volatile cycles. and there's not a lot of fun at $214 a tonne even if you are the low-cost producer. so i can't imagine others looking to invest in this industry in the medium term.

thank you. the next question is from mike leithead of barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
i wanted to go back to, i think in your prepared remarks, you made a comment about 4q production being higher. i was hoping just given the restart of chile iv, g1, some of the turnarounds coming back online. if you could give us just a little bit more color around the order of magnitude we should expect in terms of the 4q step-up, which i assume should also help some of your product mix as well.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i don't really guide to plant by plant operating rates. i think i've given enough guidance that you can come to the right number. we're not having any turnarounds. given the number for new zealand, so you can look at the capacity for other plants and kind of figure it out. but i'd rather not give a plant by plant guidance.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
fair enough. and then i did want to go back to titan and a potential restart there. kind of parsing between your words a bit, is it fair to say that getting titan eventually back up and running is more dependent on getting the right natural gas contract structure in place versus kind of demand coming back? or how should we think about what would need to happen in order to get titan back online?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so a little bit of history, probably helpful. we had a 5-year contract that ran out at the end of december, and we were always clear with the ngc that we wouldn't continue to run unless we had a gas contract. methanol market conditions were different then, and we came to a short-term arrangement as we are negotiating to keep the plant running on a day-by-day basis on a fixed price gas as we're negotiating, but our goal was never to run the plant without a medium-term 5-year gas contract. but in good faith, we worked to do that with the government. but as soon as covid hit and the demand destruction happened and pricing creator, it made no longer sense to follow that strategy, and we were very open with the ngc that we would be taking the plant down, but we would still be negotiating in good faith a contract that allowed us to generate ebitda throughout the cycle. and that's where we are today. so again, i never say never about anything, but would be unlikely for us to restart the plant in this environment without some sort of firm gas price arrangement with the ngc that takes us out three to five years. so we're still optimistic we can get there. but until we're there, we're not going to be running.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from matthew blair of tudor, pickering, holt. please go ahead. your line is now open.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
i just wanted to circle back, you mentioned some costs associated with restarting titan. with the chile iv restart, do we need to factor in any incremental cost into our q4 modeling for that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, again, i'll remind you on my guidance for chile iv, our plan was always to take it down during their winter months, covid or no covid, because gas is not available in that part of the region to run two plants during their winter time. so that would have been baked into our plans for 2020 and 2021. that's our operating model. so any associated costs with that would have been baked into our plans. titan is different. we weren't planning on shutting it down. we were optimistic we would get a gas contract. and so there would be some additional cost. i'm not prepared to say how much. but when we take chile iv down, we take it down in a way that we're going to start it up in three months. and titan was taken down with the intent of starting it up, but there'll be some additional costs. the order of magnitude, not really prepared to say until we have more detail.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
okay. sounds good. and then you had a pretty big inventory draw in q2 and now again in q3. are you happy with current inventories? or do you feel a need to build those back up in the coming quarters?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. lots of help there. when we saw what would happen in the markets, liquidity was our number 1 focus, working capital release was our #1 focus. i think our marketing team and our supply chain did an outstanding job in reducing our working capital. we're still keeping every single customer and their demand, 100% satisfied, even though it was very volatile. so again, we demonstrated our value to our customers about being flexible, agile and meeting their needs, whether they're up or down or the same. so i'll leave that to our supply chain people to decide, and they try to optimize working capital, while keeping our customers satisfied and that's what they'll continue to do.
and there'll be some fluctuations, but our guidance there is still the same. and some quarters will be a little higher, some quarters will be a little lower. but you think about it, we're selling over 10 million tonnes of methanol, our average inventory is around one million to 1.1 million. 1/3 of that is at the plant, 1/3 of that's on the water. so only 1/3 of that is servicing customers. so 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes servicing 10 million tons of sales. our team does an outstanding job each and every day and keeping working capital low and servicing our customers.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
sounds good. thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the last question is from laurence alexander of jefferies. please go ahead.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
hello. just one quick one then. given the benchmarks you gave for the green hydrogen, what would be the equivalent price of merchant of methanol plus offsets, either carbon credits or other offsets? so just so people can think if a customer wants to have a green methanol pipeline as part of their claim, what is the transition cost until the green retinal technology is sorted out?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand your question. the cost for producing green methanol, like we do at cri, is approximately 2 times what it would be for natural gas-based methanol. that's your question.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
no, if the customer would like to have -- be able to claim that they are using carbon neutral methanol, and they went out into the market to buy a carbon offset or funded renewable electricity or some other kind of program to offset, do you have any sense for what that cost would be relative to the cost of just doing green methanol with the cri technology?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i guess it depends on the price of the carbon offsets, which i understand, trade on the market, and that's pretty volatile as well. so you're probably above my pay grade there, laurence, on that question.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, and we are encouraged by recent early signs of economic recovery, including improvement in methanol demand and an increase in methanol prices. thanks to the dedication and agility of our team members worldwide, we continue to operate our plants safely and reliably and deliver secure reliable supply to our customers worldwide. in this uncertain environment, we remain focused on strengthening our business by preserving liquidity and improving financial flexibility to enhance our ability to navigate potential near-term challenges and execute on our strategies to deliver value to our shareholders over the medium to long term. thank you for joining us today, and we'll speak with you in january, and thank you for the ongoing interest in our company.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation q4 2020 earnings call.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead, ms. campbell.
kim campbell -- director, investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 results conference call. our 2020 fourth quarter news release, management's discussion and analysis and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcome to differ materially from the actual outcome. certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projections, which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our fourth quarter 2020 md&a and to our 2019 annual report for more information. i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex's future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters. for clarification, any references to revenue, ebitda, cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility. in addition, we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance, and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this manner.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's president and ceo, mr. john floren, for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kim. good morning. we hope that everyone is continuing to stay safe and healthy. i'd like to take a moment to thank our team around the world who have shown incredible dedication and flexibility in a year where we've had to change how we work to ensure that our team remains safe while continuing to deliver reliable supply to our customers. in the face of these challenges, we achieved stronger q4 results, demonstrating the resilience of our business. this morning, we will comment on our q4 and full year 2020 results, provide an overview of what we are seeing in the methanol markets, review our operational results and share our near-term outlook, including how we will continue to manage our business, given that the economic recovery path remains uncertain. now turning to our financial results. in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded adjusted ebitda of $136 million and adjusted net income of $12 million or $0.15 a share. we recorded higher fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter, primarily due to the realized prices, highlighting our significant leverage to methanol prices. our results were partly offset by changes in the mix of produced and purchased methanol sold. for the full year of 2020, our financial results were lower compared to 2019, primarily due to lower realized methanol prices. we recorded adjusted ebitda of $346 million and an adjusted net loss of $123 million or $1.62 per share for 2020. now turning to the methanol market. in the fourth quarter, the continued improvement in the global methanol demand, combined with various planned and unplanned methanol industry outages and delayed start-up of new industry capacity, led to tighter market conditions and lower inventory levels, supporting higher methanol prices. global methanol demand began to recover in the second half of 2020 after falling in the first half of the year due to the impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and a lower oil price environment.
we estimate that global methanol demand increased by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter. overall, we estimate that the global methanol demand totaled approximately 82 million tonnes in 2020, which is a 3% decrease compared to 2019. before covid-19, we forecasted global methanol demand growth of approximately 3%. as a result, we estimate that 2020 global methanol demand is approximately 5% to 6% lower than pre-covid expectations. the methanol industry ran at lower operating rates in 2020 due to plant shutdowns to respond to the lower methanol demand as well as various planned and unplanned outages. in the fourth quarter, there were a number of plant outages around the world, particularly in iran and in china, where there was a diversion of natural gas to meet seasonal power demand instead of methanol production. the delayed start-up of new industry capacity additions also contributed to tighter market conditions. we estimate that the industry cost curve, which continues to be set in china, is approximately $260 per tonne. the cost curve is higher than the third quarter as a result of higher coal prices. spot prices in china are above this range today. so far, in the first quarter of 2021, market conditions remain tight, and we posted higher prices for january and february 2021. we recently posted our february north american price, which increased to $492 per tonne; and our asia pacific price, which increased to $430 per tonne. our european contract price is set quarterly, and our first quarter posted price is eur390 or $475 per tonne. we mentioned on our q3 quarterly call that we will provide updated guidance to our discount rate to posted methanol prices. in 2021, we expect to see a higher discount rate of approximately 17% on average compared to our prior 15% guidance as we saw more competitive environment given broader economic uncertainty. recall that when prices increase quickly, our discount rate tends to decrease and the reverse is true when prices decrease quickly.
now turning to our operational results. we will speak to our fourth quarter production results and provide comments regarding our production outlook for 2021, including ongoing natural gas curtailments that are expected in new zealand, trinidad and chile. our production levels were higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to higher gas availability in new zealand and chile and record production at our geismar facilities. in new zealand, our production levels were higher in the fourth quarter due to improved gas supply. in 2021, our outlook for new zealand production is uncertain. our gas suppliers have recently advised that a major offshore gas deal, which supplies the new zealand market and underpins a portion of our production, has experienced significant and unexpected production declines, which will result in lower gas deliveries. given that gas deliveries are expected to be lower in 2021, we are consolidating production in our two large motunui clients, which have a combined operating capacity of 1.7 million tonnes, and temporarily idling our smaller waitara valley plant. we estimate production in new zealand for 2021 of 1.5 million to 1.6 million tonnes compared to our 2020 production of 1.7 million tonnes. in geismar, both plants ran at full operating rates during the fourth quarter. our production benefited from the completion of our low-cost debottlenecking project at our geismar one plant, and we have seen a 10% increase in our daily production capability of this plant. we expect to complete the debottlenecking work at our geismar two plant in 2021. when the debottlenecking activities are complete, the geismar facilities will have an operating capacity of 2.2 million tonnes on an annual basis. in trinidad, our production levels in the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as planned turnaround activities at our atlas facility impacted both quarters. looking into 2021, we have been advised that upstream production declines and the delay of upstream maintenance work due to covid-19 will result in lower gas deliveries.
it is unclear how long these lower gas deliveries will persist. based on our current gas deliveries, we estimate production in trinidad for 2021 of 900,000 tonnes, reflecting methanex interest compared with our 2020 production of one million tonnes. all 2021 production is expected to come from the atlas facility, as we announced earlier this month that we expect that the titan facility will remain idled indefinitely because we have not been able to reach an acceptable longer-term natural gas agreement. we continue to have discussions around opportunities for longer-term gas supply. in chile, our production levels were higher in the fourth quarter as we received higher gas deliveries. however, due to lower gas deliveries later in the fourth quarter resulting from upstream production declines in argentina, we are unable to run both plants in december. our chile iv plant remains idle today, and its uncertain how long these lower gas deliveries will persist. we estimate production in chile for 2021 of 900,000 to one million tonnes compared to our 2020 production of 800,000 tonnes. in egypt, production in the fourth quarter was similar to the third quarter. in medicine hat, our plants -- plant ran at nearly full operating rates after the completion of a planned turnaround that concluded at the end of october. our 2021 production is forecasted to be similar to 2020 production of 6.6 million tonnes, although actual production may vary by quarter based on gas availability, planned outages, extended unplanned outages and unanticipated factors. now turning to our balance sheet. we took a series of decisive actions in 2020 to further strengthen our business and our balance sheet. as a result, we ended the year with a strong liquidity position of over $800 million in cash, a $300 million undrawn revolving credit facility and no debt maturities until the end of 2024.
our disciplined approach to capital allocation has not changed, and over the long term, we believe we are well positioned to meet our financial commitments, execute on attractive growth opportunities that exceed our hurdle rate and deliver in our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. regarding our geismar three project, as we personally -- previously discussed, this is a high-quality project with substantial capital and operating cost advantages. in april of 2020, we placed a project on temporary care and maintenance for up to 18 months, given the significant uncertainty regarding the global economy due to covid-19. the project was in excellent shape and progress had been safe, on time and on budget, and the project has been significantly derisked. construction on the geismar three project remains on hold. we have a robust decision-making process for evaluating the project. and before deciding whether to restart construction, management and our board will need to carefully consider many factors, including the strength of the global economic recovery and the overall methanol industry outlook. we are encouraged by the early signs of economic recovery that began in the second half of 2020. however, given that the covid-19 pandemic continues to limit our near-term visibility, it is difficult to predict how methanol demand, industry supply and methanol prices will ultimately recover on a sustained basis. for now, we remain cautious, and we are prioritizing liquidity and financial flexibility. now turning to our outlook for the first quarter. in the near term, based on our posted prices so far, we expect realized methanol prices in the first quarter of 2021 will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. we expect that our production levels will be similar compared to the fourth quarter, given the natural gas curtailments in new zealand, trinidad and chile that we mentioned earlier. adjusted ebitda is expected in the first quarter to be higher compared to the fourth quarter. in 2021, we will remain focused on operating our plants safely and reliably, delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers and protecting our strong financial position and financial flexibility. we are well positioned to continue delivering significant value to shareholders over the medium to long term as market conditions improve.
we would now be happy to answer any questions.

[operator instructions] the first question is from joel jackson of bmo capital markets. please go ahead. your line is now open.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, joel.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
john, i know you can't predict the future. can you help us handicap, as you sort of plan your business, how you would see the different cast issues you're facing right now sort of normalizing? like can you prioritize what you think will come back to be normalized faster? it would seem like you think new zealand might be the one that's most likely not to normalize soon because of the consolidation of plants. can you just give us, as much as you can, about how you see it happening?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
that's really difficult to predict. these -- the new zealand news and the trinidad news came late last year. nobody was expecting that news, including our gas suppliers. so we're working with them to really understand the problem. i think in new zealand, the suppliers have tried some things to see if they could impact what's happened in the field unsuccessfully. so i think what we understand is there has to be some drilling going on there to recover the field fully, and that's going to take some time to get rigs, et cetera. so hopefully, sometime later this year, but it's really hard to predict. and then we have to make an investment. we are planning to take our waitara valley plant down february 1st for a fairly significant turnaround from a statutory point of view. obviously, without the gas, it doesn't make sense to spend any money on that plant. so we'll have to have a really good view that we'll have enough gas for a three-plant operation for a sustained period before we invest any money in the waitara valley plant. it maybe better for us just to run the two larger ones for the foreseeable future, but early days we're still working with our gas suppliers to understand the issue. i think chile, argentina didn't have much investment in gas because of covid-19. that's changed in the fourth quarter. and we're being told by our gas suppliers to expect gas deliveries later this year. but until we see it, we'll continue to run one plant. and trinidad is pretty opaque, so i really don't have anything to update with trinidad other than we were told a few weeks ago that -- to expect gas deliveries at about 80%.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. and then my last question would be, you know that u.s. gulf spot methanol prices were somewhat weak in january, i think, down about $30 a tonne. you were able to set the february posted price contract at about like $10 a tonne higher month-over-month. can you talk about some of the dynamic there despite a slower -- a weaker spot market, you're able to raise prices? i guess, spot prices don't matter. your customers are happy. this is related to some of your now lower gas availability. anything there would be helpful. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i've always said, in europe and north america, the spot markets are pretty liquid. very little product gets traded on the spot markets. they're an indication, but they don't really drive pricing decisions in those two markets. in asia and china, especially, the spot market is very large. so -- and has a bigger impact in when we're thinking about prices. so i know our team look at supply demand and the fundamentals for the next period, 30, 60 days. they talk to the customers about what they're seeing in their supply demand balances, and then we make decisions on pricing. and based on those discussions, we increase our prices slightly. so we still continue to see inventories quite snug, and demand not back to '19 levels, but better than it was in the first half of last year. but i'd say this is -- this tightness is being driven by unplanned and planned maintenance around the world as well as gas availability issues in places like iran and china. so when those will turn around? who knows. we are above the cost curve all of 2018 by $100 a tonne, and that's kind of where we are today, $100 a tonne above the cost curve. when that changes, it really will be a factor of supply coming on. there's anticipated new supply as well from a plant in the united states and really around demand recovery. i think the hardest thing for us to predict today is demand recovery in this covid-19 environment as we see the second wave and governments taking different actions. and really, the vaccine rollouts are starting, but probably going to take some time to work their way through and see restrictions lowered somewhat. so it's a really tough environment to predict, joel.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from jacob bout of cibc. please go ahead.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
good morning, john. just a question on g3. are you still targeting mid-2021 decision? and how far can you push up this decision before there's more financial penalties?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our target to make a decision on g3 is in the summer. obviously, our teams are working hard to see what different options we might have by that time, and we certainly will want to look at what's going on in the methanol markets as part of that decision. so i know our teams are working hard to see what are our options to defer or start or other things, and really don't have any numbers at this time around that.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
okay. and then thermal coal prices have actually moved quite a bit in china. i'm interested in getting your thoughts around where you think the cost curve floor is for methanol right now.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. today, we see it around $260, jacob. it's based on coal and some natural gas as well. that coal has moved up to the higher end of the range that the government had stated after the 2016 price collapse in oil. it's really driven by supply/demand. i -- it's hard to predict, but i don't think coal is going to go much higher than where it is today, unless you see oil going to $60, $70, $80, which is not our view. so -- but we'll continue to watch it. we're a bit surprised how high the coal price is in china at this point.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
thanks, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is from john roberts of ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. nice quarter. there's been a lot of disruption in freight for container ships. are bulk liquid shipments being affected at all? i know you have your own ships, but is the methanol industry at all having any logistical challenges here?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're not. i'm not aware of any others. there seems to be available shipping for chemical liquids. no, i'm not aware of any, john, at all. i mean, i am aware of what's going on in the container industry, though. and i think that's more driven by lots of products coming from china and not much going back. so i think it's different in the liquids market.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then earlier this year, you talked about your own maintenance being challenging during the pandemic. is that a significant cause of the greater industry downtime? are competitors either delaying maintenance and that's reducing their reliability in causing some of the outages or when they're doing maintenance, it's just being more disruptive to supply?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i can only speak to our own experience. but if you're following covid-19 safety protocols, you've got a lot -- a lot more time to follow those. so you do have extended from original schedules. you've got probably more investment because you have social distancing and all of those things, and it's tough to get people, experts into certain countries. when we did our trinidad turnaround, it was really difficult to get our -- usually, we bring 40 or 50 global experts in to help. so a lot of that was done remotely by cameras and videos. and it takes a lot longer and not as efficient, and maybe not as good either. so that's been our experience. and i'm sure anybody in the petrochemical or anybody that's running a large plant that goes through these kind of turnarounds is experiencing the same thing.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from mike leithead of barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
first, just a question on the higher discount rate that you mentioned for 2021. i was hoping you can maybe just talk a bit more about what's driving it, whether it's a specific region or start-up of new capacity. and is it more indicative of what's going on here at the beginning of the year or do you kind of expect this to be the ongoing level of discount kind of moving forward?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that guidance is for 2021. most of the contracts globally for methanol are negotiated in the fourth quarter of any given year. like i mentioned in my remarks, we were expecting three million to four million tonne growth in methanol demand, and we saw a three million tonne decline. so that's about six million tonne different than what the industry was expecting. that's four or five world-scale plants. so i think there was a lot more -- i don't think, i know there was a lot more rivalry as we negotiated contracts. and some competitors, maybe that didn't have home for their product, really offering all-time high discounts. so we're in this for the long term. we work with our customers over the long term, and we're certainly not going to be moved aside on a price basis because of a short term -- what we believe is a short-term demand situation. so we took the decision to be competitive, then it's a commodity and you need to be competitive, and that's what's going on here. so we've seen this before, but not to the extent of the rivalry that we saw at the end of last year.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and maybe just a broader industry question on methanol demand. there's obviously been a lot of talk lately about clean energy and the use of hydrogen. obviously, methanol has a lot of merits as a clean burning fuel source and methanex has done a lot of work advocating for that. i'm curious in your conversations, if you've seen a change in the conversations with potential customers about methanols and energy opportunity and if that's changed your long-term view at all in that regard?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've had an investment in this clean burning methanol, clean -- i'm sorry, zero carbon methanol in iceland for 10 years. it's a small plant, but it takes water and splits it into hydrogen and oxygen and take co2 up our power plant, and we make methanol. so it's 100% carbon-free. the challenge is the cost. the cost of that kind of methanol is two to three times methanol made from natural gas. now there's the odd customer that will pay that kind of pricing based on they wanting to have a green footprint, but it's a very, very small part of the overall industry. the technology works. it's scalable to -- not to the extent that we see natural gas, but you can probably do 50,000 to 100,000 tonne plant. but you need 10 of those to meet a world-scale plant from natural gas. we don't have customers today that are asking for millions of tonnes of carbon-free methanol. those really won't happen in the future. but we are ready to scale. we are ready to move, but we need a much higher price than even what we're seeing today in the methanol markets to make a return on capital. so it's a bit of a chicken and the egg of the technology is there. it's -- we can do it. but right now, we haven't had the customers lined up to pay $1,000 a tonne for that kind of methanol. so we're certainly not going to blindly invest in multiple plants based on this technology without having some secured contracts that make sense from a return on capital employed basis.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.

yes. good morning, john. john, i know it's hard for you to comment on others specifically, but, you know, the challenges that you've seen here on your gas supply specifically, it sounds like there's some unique situations in each country. but as a general common theme, it sounds like some upstream or lack of upstream capabilities or maintenance or whatever it has been through covid has had some impact across the board. is there -- are there other instances in the industry that are suffering from the same challenges? i'm just trying to get a sense for whether it's going to be something more broad or if it's just, for whatever reason, isolated to yourself. and just as a related question, trinidad strikes me as the most interesting, just given that we've seen the new plant start-up there recently. so just maybe walk us through your thoughts on that, if you could?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i don't have any specific information about gas issues in other countries other than what we've already reported on productions in places like trinidad and venezuela as two examples. we understand there could be issues maybe in indonesia as well, but we don't have any specific information on why or how come. it seems to be more and more gas is diverted in places like china and iran in the wintertime, which has been a phenomenon we've seen for the last, geez, 10 years, but it seems to be more acute this year. is that because of colder weather? it could be. is that because of more demand? probably. but we're not at the table at these governments making these decisions. i would say, i'm really happy that we have three plants in north america, where there are no gas issues and looks like no gas issues for the foreseeable future. and egypt is a really good news story, where there's a lot more gas than there is demand right now, and that's because of all of the success they've had in the exploration of the upstream. so yes, we've seen these issues. i can go -- i mean, you remember, medicine hut was shut down for 10 years, and we had to shut fort in louisiana. and we only -- we're down to one small plant in new zealand. so this hasn't been an issue for us in the 20 years i've been at the company. so it's really hard to predict when these things happen and how long they last. but we'll work with our suppliers, and we'll get through this. we don't think this is a significantly long-term issue in any region, but we need to be cautious about when and if we can resolve these problems.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's fair. and just a follow-up, if i may, on the discount question earlier. you're suggesting this is a somewhat short-term issue. but i mean, if we're thinking about into 2022, should we think about that 17% rate holding or do you think we'll get back to that more normalized 15%? and just as related to that, is this a regional-specific issue or is this more globally as you negotiate contracts?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so again, i don't like predicting the future. but i'd say not all of our contracts come up every year. there's a portion of them come up. so you can see the impact of even a portion of the business being renegotiated in a very competitive environment. steve, i think it's going to be a factor what's demand look like, you know, how do we recover demand and how does the new supply get absorbed. so beyond the coke plant in the united states, there's not a heck of a lot coming on in the next five years. so it could be -- depends on what your view the short-term is, but we're pretty excited about the medium-term supply demand fundamentals as long as we can get beyond this pandemic and get some more normal activity on a global basis.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. we're done. thanks.

thank you. the next question is from hassan ahmed of alembic global advisors. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advises -- analyst
good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advises -- analyst
john, i want you to sort of touch on the outages that the industry experienced, particularly in the back half of the year. i mean, if my numbers are correct, i believe it was, like, slightly north of eight million tonnes of methanol capacity that was going through, you know, be it planned or unplanned outages. now you touched on certain sorts of gas issues out in trinidad, issues out in new zealand as well. i mean, where would you see that number being through the course of 2021?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. again, i have no idea what are unplanned outages like. we know what planned outages are. these plants need to turn around every three to four years. but what else is going to go on with those plants, and what are the vulnerabilities, i have no idea, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advises -- analyst
okay. okay. now as a follow-up, obviously, an administration change here, in the u.s., and i'd like to think that the current administration would not be as hawkish on the iranian side of things. are you seeing any sort of early signs of iranian products sort of making it into the export market currently? and what are your expectations, call it, over the next couple of months?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. iran has been experiencing quite a few restrictions, we understand, on gas. they've had some technical issues we understand as well. so we haven't seen normal amounts of product coming out of our end, which is the phenomenon we've seen this time every year for the last number of years. i'd say it's more acute right now. what the new administration in the united states decides to do with the iran deal and sanctions is beyond my pay grade levels. so i'll take a pass on that one.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advises -- analyst
thanks so much, john.
operator
thank you. the next question is from cherilyn radbourne of td securities. please go ahead.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
thanks very much and good morning. steve sort of asked my question on gas availability. but, john, with respect to new zealand, in particular, can you just comment on what you would need to see in order to undertake a significant turnaround at the waitara valley plant and what sort of lead time you would need to undertake that kind of decision?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, we're in the midst of planning that turnaround when we got the news. so the planning is done. it's a matter of people and a bit of equipment. but i'd say we'd need to see gas availability and the technical issues resolved on that field to allow us to have run a three-plant operation for a significant period of time. that's what we were set up to do when we plan to turn around the waitara valley, and this is a very significant field, and we're half the gas market in new zealand. so you can imagine the impact not only on us but the electrical generation and others in new zealand. so our suppliers weren't expecting this to happen, and they tried other things to resolve it and they've been unsuccessful. so we rely on them to give us information on what they see. i think there's going to have to be some drilling done in this field to correct the problem. it's correctable, so that's going to take some time.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
and just-and just with respect to capital allocation, i'm going to ask this in a couple of ways. so just comment on how you think about geismar three versus share buybacks versus dividends. and is there a scenario over the next couple of years where you don't resume spending on geismar three, but do you feel comfortable allocating some cash to buybacks or dividends or increased dividends, i should say?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. like i mentioned in my remarks, nothing has really changed with our capital allocation strategy. grow the company, the rate of growth, the methanol market, which obviously didn't grow in 2020, and then return excess cash through dividends and share buybacks, that's been our strategy that hasn't changed, i'd say, in this environment, where financial flexibility and liquidity trump all of those. and if we have pricing like we see today for a couple of years, we'll have tons of cash to grow the company, to return share -- money to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. so to me, it's all about demand. what happens with demand? do we get back to a more normal situation of demand growth? and if we do, then beyond the coke plant that's coming up, we think the supply demand fundamentals are very attractive, which will lead to pricing that allows us to generate a lot of cash and fulfill our strategy on capital allocation. but today, it's really uncertain. so we'll keep our powder dry. and when we look to the g3 decision in the summer, we'll have a bit more information around how the pandemic is impacting demand for methanol.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
okay. thank you for the time, john.

thank you. the next question is from nelson ng of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
my first question relates to trinidad. in terms of the cgcl methanol plant being fully commissioned, does that materially reduce the availability for natural gas potentially for titan or any other facilities or needs in trinidad? i was just wondering in terms of, like, you recently put titan -- you idled titan indefinitely, but i'm just wondering if conversations are still taking place and whether the outlook has -- so it doesn't look very favorable there.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i've mentioned before the upstream and the government are negotiating different terms of what they are today. the terms that there are today don't allow us to run that titan plant through the cycle. so we kept it down and ready to go for eight months and had those solutions. we decided to isolate more on an indefinite period. the supply demand balance of gas fitted out is really a factor of price. and we don't know where the gas is coming from the new plant, but obviously, it will impact the overall supply demand balance. but many of our -- other people on the site, ammonia and methanol, have also experienced the same thing we have and shut down capacity. so there's a lot of capacity in ammonia methanol that's not running. and i think we're going to need to see more gas development and get back to a balanced market there. so it's complicated, and we were unsuccessful and some of our people that manufacture ammonia have been unsuccessful and made the same decision we did. so we continue to talk to the government, and here's something that makes sense on a medium-term basis. we'll have to restart that plant, but it will take capital as well. so not too dissimilar to what we're seeing in waitara valley. we'll have to spend money and hire people, and that takes time.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. got it. and then moving on to chile. based on all the kind of various supply agreements you have in place, are you able to give a bit of color in terms of how much gas you typically expect from argentina?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we -- i mentioned before we had gas contracts signed up to run two plants throughout the year except for the winter time or summer time for about three months. so we expect it to have 75% operating rates throughout the year. i also mentioned the argentinian gas was interruptible, both by us and by the supplier. and we chose to interrupt that gas in april when covid happened and shut down one of our plants because of demand. so they've also exercised their rights on interruptible gas because of the lack of exploration and development in 2020. well, that's changed now that there's a lot more being spent, and we're being told to expect gas to run both plants some time this year. but until we see it, we'll continue to be cautious and run the one plant.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and is all the gas from argentina on that tolling arrangement where they send you gas and you process it into methanol and send it back?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, we haven't had that arrangement for four or five years.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. got it. thanks a lot.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is from eric petrie of citi. please go ahead. your line is now open.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
as north america turns to a net exporter of methanol, do you see any change in pricing relationship between the regions?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we watch that pretty closely, and up to now, we haven't seen any impact. i guess the next milestone will be the coke methanol plant. but what else happens in the basin, it's not just a north american situation. it's the whole atlantic basin and the supply demand fundamentals there will dictate if there's any impact. but up to now, we haven't seen any impact on the pricing and the basin balances.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then on g3, you noticed your preference to do a partner on that project. can you discuss what the pool of potential parties look like or has that stalled given covid-19?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're pretty well in the stalled mode on partner discussions. if you recall, this time last year, we had hired a banker to run the process for us. and then it's actually one year today that we had our first case in bc. so obviously, when covid happened, those discussions, people weren't looking to invest in methanol plants at that time. so i think it's difficult in this environment to pursue partnership discussions, but that's still our preference.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then last, could you just give an update what your planned operating changes, what the $10 per tonne price change in methanol translates to ebitda and free cash flow?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we'll take that offline.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i'll have kim follow up with you.

thank you. the next question is from ben isaacson of scotiabank. please go ahead. your line is now open.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you and good morning, john. first question is where is methanol demand the weakest right now, if it's -- if you want to answer that by region or by end use market. would that be fuel blending or mtbe? and kind of what gives you the greatest concern about demand recovery going forward?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
did you say it was the deepest?
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
the weakest.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so if i look -- if i look at 2020 versus 2019, which i think is the most recent data we have, traditional demand was down 5%. energy was flat, but really driven by mto, which is up 12%, and then the other energy that's really for transportation. like mtbe, fuel, they were all down 5% to 6%. so the only shining star in 2020 was mto, and that was up 12% year-over-year. i'd say as far as regions, china is back to where it was as far as demand in 2020 versus 2019. the rest of the world, i'd say north america is down the most by about 9%, the rest of the world between 4% to 6%, and that's year-over-year.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
great. and as a follow-up, is there a market for china or others buying used plants? i'm just thinking like if you think about titan or chile iv or waitara in new zealand, is there a way to offset the capex or partially offset the capex at g3 by selling some of these plants to the chinese for a few hundred million dollars, and that would reduce the risk profile for g3?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, we've looked at the chile iv, remember, was a bolt-on at chile i, ii, iii, now only chile i. so that's not really a stand-alone plant, except for what we've been able to do, integrating it to chile i. we looked at moving titan, and the way it's built, it's probably worse, not very much some equipment and some steel. and waitara valley is pretty old. it needs quite some tender loving care. so i don't think we're at the point today where we're going to be selling these plants for cents on the dollar. we're going to try and see a little bit more visibility on the gas situation in all three. we've had these challenges before. there were lots of attempts to buy our medicine hat plant over the 10 years it was down, and we sold two and kept one. i'm glad we kept the one because we got sense on the dollars for the other two, and it would be nice to have a three-plant operation there today. so the future is very hard to predict. so i think we'll -- we're not in that mode yet, ben.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from jonas oxgaard of bernstein. please go ahead.
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you. a question right now lng prices spiked up to, i think, $20 per mmbtu. coal prices spiked. this seemed to be on the way back again. in your experience, when we've seen these things in the past, does that have any material impact on global production? do producers take a brief hiatus during a spike like this?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
methanol producers?
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
yes.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, in the past, and when these spikes have happened, we haven't seen any impact on the lng. now coal was to spike beyond where we are today. it's just a matter of to move the cost curve up. but like i mentioned earlier, we're already $100 a tonne above the cost curve. so we would think, in this environment, anybody that could run a methanol plant is running as hard as they can. so there's lots of room for coal prices to go up and still be cash positive in china. so it's really a factor of how high the price is and how long they think the price is sustainable. but there's lots of room today to have every plant that can run, run at full rates.
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay. then i had a separate question. i just want to follow up on the -- on that carbon-free methanol in iceland. so you mentioned that it's expensive to produce. but if you think of it as a carbon sequestration, how does the cost compare to sequestering co2? and this seems to be a potential solution for places like iceland that can sequester co2. so how does it compare to other possible co2 elimination efforts?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's more favorable. i mean when we looked around the world at technologies to produce methanol carbon-free, this was the one that made the most sense to us, expensive and smaller scale. i haven't dusted off the sequestration numbers for a bit, but it was very expensive to -- for one of our plants like in louisiana or medicine hat to sequester carbon. but i haven't dusted those numbers off. so i'll have to take that offline and get back to you.
jonas oxgaard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from matthew blair of tph. please go ahead. your line is now open.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
hey. good morning, john. the release noted that global methanol demand rose 2% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. could you share any insights on how that might be progressing so far in q1 '21 here?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. q1 is usually the low quarter for methanol demand. so when we look at quarter-over-quarter, we see it pretty well flat to down a little bit, but that's based on forecast. so i'm not very good in the forecasting business, but that's our expectation today.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
sounds good. and then, john, you always had helpful commentary on china. could you talk about the current dynamics in the country with natural gas being diverted to home heating use? and do you have any numbers you can share on just what kind of impact that's having on methanol production in the region?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. like i mentioned, anybody that can produce methanol today will be producing at full rates because of the pricing dynamics. as already mentioned on the call, lng prices have spiked. china is a large importer of lng. at $20 an mmbtu, it doesn't make sense to make methanol. so we've seen this in the past, and we would expect as temperatures come into the summertime. and prices for methanol stay where they are that we would expect more natural gas producers to be making methanol. but until we see it, like i said, in 2018 because of supply issues, we saw the price remain above the cost curve by $100 the whole year. kind of unusual to see that, but it's really hard to predict in this environment. to me, it's all about demand and demand recovery that will lead to sustainable good pricing.
matthew blair -- tph -- analyst
that's good. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from adam starr of gulfside asset management. please go ahead. your line is now open.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
hi. thank you for keeping me in the queue. yes, what do you expect capital spending to be this year, excluding any decisions on geismar? and what would -- what do you think the cost of completing geismar would be if you go ahead with that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our maintenance capital spend this year will be about $110 million. and to complete geismar, well, the team's doing that work right now. but based on our initial numbers, if we decide to restart the construction later this year, the budget that we're looking at is not too different than what we had already signaled to the market, which is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. and up to the end of this year, we had spent $365 million. so we've got about $900 million to $1 billion to go.
ian cameron -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes, adam, we have about $80 million of cost to spend this year on the care and maintenance program. and then after that, it's about $900 million to get to john's number of the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion total.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
and that care and maintenance, is that within the $110 million of maintenance capex for the whole company?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, that's in addition to the $110 million.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
got you. that's very helpful. i appreciate it. and the argentine situation, does that have anything to do with the most recent change in government? has there been policies that have affected gas production or is this entirely business related and has nothing to do with the political situation?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there were a number of reasons, including politics. no investment happened for most of 2020, but that has changed in the fourth quarter, and we're seeing more development of gas. so that doesn't mean it can't change again, but there are policies in place today that are very helpful and encouraging to suppliers in the upstream.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i appreciate your answers.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the last question is from steve hansen of raymond james. please go ahead. your line is now open.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. sorry, john, just a follow-up here on g3. so if we presume -- and i'm not going to say it's the conclusion yet, but if we presume that there is a deferral of g3 this summer, if there's a decision not to proceed, what happens next? what is the next gating milestone after that? i know you can't put these projects on care and maintenance for a longer period of time. but will you revisit it annually, quarterly? what is the process here coming into this important decision?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, we're going through that now. so what are our options? i think the more you delay, the more risk to the project. that's clear. product team is still in place. and a lot of the things that we put in place are still there through this care and maintenance period. if you have a further deferral extended time, that adds more risk to the project. so our teams are working through what are our options, and probably comes down to start, restart or defer for a period. and depending on how long that period is, you'll have different risks and different costs. so our teams are working on that. it's pretty -- too premature to be sharing any of that data yet, steve.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. no, that's fair. and just as a follow-up, thinking back a few years now, you reported to have some chinese partners, potential partners at the table. a lot of that got squashed with some of the political dynamics taking place, new administration in the u.s. again. i mean, how do you feel about reengaging on one or two of those chinese partners that you had in previous discussions with?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we'd love to have a chinese partner for the geismar project, geismar three, but i think china is going to take a wait-and-see attitude toward the new administration. i'm not a political expert, but are things going to change significantly between the two countries? i don't know. so we'll see. i think they're going to take a wait-and-see attitude as well.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's fair, thanks. thanks for your time.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
okay, well, thanks very much. we've continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model throughout the pandemic and our competitive advantage on delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers around the world. we are encouraged by the continued improvement we have seen in methanol demand and prices, although the near-term economic recovery path remains uncertain. we remain focused on operating our plants safely and reliably, delivering secure, reliable supply to our customers and protecting our strong financial position and financial flexibility. we continue to believe that the long-term outlook for methanol remains intact. methanol is a key chemical building block that is used to produce a variety of everyday consumer and industrial items. methanol is also used in a growing number of clean burning and economic alternative energy applications. while there are limited industry capacity additions expected beyond 2022 based on lower investment in the current environment, we expect the demand for methanol to rebound and grow as global economic activity recovers. we will emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever, and we'll continue to execute on our consistent strategy to deliver significant value to shareholders over the medium to long term. thank you for joining us today, and we'll speak with you in april, and thank you for the interest in our company.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation q1 2021 earnings call.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead.
kim campbell -- director of ir
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to our first quarter 2021 results conference call. our 2021 first quarter news release, management's discussion and analysis and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcomes to differ materially from the actual outcome.

i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's president and chief executive officer, mr. john floren, for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. we hope that you are continuing to stay safe and healthy. as we deliver our q1 2021 results, it's hard to believe that we've operated through the pandemic for over 12 months. our resilient business model and robust planning and execution have enabled us to navigate through this challenging period. we are incredibly proud of our team worldwide who have shown tremendous commitment and agility over this year. our teams have continually adjusted how we work to keep each other safe while maintaining our operations and delivering reliable methanol supply to our customers.
this morning, i'm pleased to discuss our strong first quarter 2021 financial results, which highlight the value of our business model. we will also share what we see in the methanol market today to review our operational results and discuss our outlook entering the second quarter. turning to our financial results. we posted higher methanol prices in the first quarter of 2021, increasing our average realized price to $363 per tonne, up by $81 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. we our adjusted ebitda of $242 million increased by $106 million over the fourth quarter of 2020. these results demonstrate the leverage that our earnings have to higher ethanol prices.
we also recorded higher adjusted net income of $82 million or $1.07 per share in the first quarter, an increase of $70 million or $0.92 per share compared to the fourth quarter. turning to the markets. methanol demand continues to recover and at the current trajectory, we anticipate the global methanol demand will return to pre-pandemic levels later this year. global methanol demand in the first quarter of 2021 increased by approximately 5% compared to the first quarter of 2020. this steady methanol demand recovery, combined with ongoing industry supply challenges led to tight market conditions and higher methanol prices in the first quarter.
we are pleased to see favorable industry conditions continue into the second quarter. we estimate the industry cost curve, which is set in china, remains at approximately $260 to $280 per tonne. spot prices in china are above this range today. early in the second quarter, methanol market conditions remained tight and global inventory levels remain low and industry supply challenges persist and methanol demand continues to recover. we recently posted our may north american price, which increased by $23 to $542 per tonne, and our asia pacific price, which remained at $430 per tonne.
we set our european contract price quarterly and our second quarter posted price is eur410 or approximately $490 per tonne. now turning to our operational results. our first quarter of 2021 production of 1.6 million tonnes was similar to our fourth quarter results. higher production of our atlas and medicine hat facilities offset lower production at new zealand and geismar facilities in the first quarter. in new zealand, our production was lower in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to lower gas deliveries. as we mentioned last quarter, we consolidated production on our two large larger motunui plants in idle waitara valley plant indefinitely.
we estimate production in new zealand for 2021 of 1.5 million tonnes. the upstream gas sector will be completing several field development projects that are expected to improve gas availability over the coming years. in geismar, our production in the first quarter was lower than the fourth quarter because we completed a planned turnaround at our geismar two facility. winter storm uri in february did not significantly impact the site. following the turnaround, our geismar facility has been running extremely well, and we have achieved record production levels at this site.
we completed the debottlenecking project work at geismar one plant in 2020, and we expect the geismar two debottlenecking project to be complete in mid-2021. as a result, our operating capacity for our geismar facilities will increase to 2.2 million tonnes from two million tonnes, an increase of 10%. in trinidad, our production in the first quarter was higher than the fourth quarter as planned turnaround activities impacted production in the fourth quarter. based on current gas deliveries, we estimate production in trinidad for 2021 to be 1.1 million tonnes, reflecting methanex' interest.
in chile, our production in the first quarter was higher than the fourth quarter as our chile i plant ran nearly at full operating rates. our chile iv plant remains idle due to gas supply constraints driven by upstream production declines in argentina. we typically experience lower gas deliveries in the southern hemisphere winter months impacting our second and third quarters, and it is uncertain how long these lower gas deliveries will persist. our current gas supply is sufficient to run our chile i plant, and we estimate production for chile for 2021 to be 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes.
in egypt, our production in the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter as our plant ran at nearly full operating rates. in medicine hat, our production in the first quarter was higher as planned turnaround activities impacted production in the fourth quarter. now turning to our balance sheet. we have a strong liquidity position with over $850 million in cash, a $300 million undrawn revolving credit facility with no debt maturities until the end of 2024. our disciplined approach to capital allocation has not changed.
over the long term, we believe we're well positioned to meet our financial commitments, execute on attractive growth opportunities that exceed our hurdle rate and deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. a key focus for us in 2021 is deciding on the next steps of our geismar three project. a unique project with significant capital and operating cost advantages. we have a robust decision-making process for evaluating the project.
before deciding whether to restart construction, management and our board will carefully consider many factors, including the strength of the global economic recovery and the overall methanol industry outlook, our financial position and our ability to execute on the project. we expect to decide on the next steps for the project later this year. we are encouraged by the favorable industry conditions that we have seen so far in 2021. we continue to monitor industry operating rates and new capacity scheduled to start up later this year, and the impact on the current global supply demand balance.
we are optimistic that the global economic recovery will accelerate as vaccines rolled out worldwide and as governments announced additional fiscal support measures. for now, we continue to prioritize liquidity and financial flexibility to best position ourselves to deliver long-term shareholder value. now turning to the outlook for the second quarter. we expect realized methanol prices in the second quarter of 2021 will be similar to the first quarter based on our posted prices so far. we forecast that our second quarter production will be similar to the first quarter.
we anticipate similar adjusted ebitda results in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. we continue to focus on operating our plants safely and reliably, delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers and protecting our financial flexibility. we are well positioned to deliver long-term value to shareholders.
we would now be happy to answer questions.

operator
thank you. sorry, i was on mute. thank you. we will now take questions from the telephone lines. [operator instructions] our first question, jacob bout, cibc. your line is open, please go ahead.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
alright. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jacob.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
first question here, just about the -- some pretty decent free cash flow in the quarter. maybe just talk about priorities for capital allocation, share buyback dividend, investment in g3.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so nothing's really changed, jacob, in our strategy about capital allocation. we are prioritizing financial flexibility and liquidity at this point. as we come out of the pandemic and get clarity on demand and certainly, supply is much more understood. but really, three reasons for cash, nothing's really changed. we'll take some cash to grow the company in line with how the market grows. as long as we can find projects that exceed our hurdle -- or meet or exceed our hurdle rate, which certainly geismar three does. and then we'll also take a balanced approach to return additional excess cash to shareholders through dividend and buybacks. so nothing's really changed in our capital allocation strategy.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
would you put g3 ahead of increasing dividend?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
again, we take a balanced approach. so we looked at -- over the last period, we've, i think, returned $2 billion through dividends and share repurchases and growing the company doubled its size by investing similar amount of money. so obviously, when we're doing a brownfield or greenfield project, depending on the price of methanol, most of the free cash would go to constructing a project. but above $300 a tonne realized, we can complete g3 and have additional cash for distribution. so a lot will be determined by what the actual realized price for methanol will be.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
are you still looking for a partner at g3?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
our preference is still to have a partner for g3, and we're pursuing that.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
alright, we'll leave it there. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jacob.
operator
thank you. our next question from ben isaacson, scotiabank. your line is open, please go ahead.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you and good morning, everyone. john, first question is on the discount rate came in at roughly, i think it was 18 eight methanex have guided for around 17 for the year. does that mean that we need to increase that discount rate for the year? or do you expect it to fall below 17 in the back half of the year to get to that guidance?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ben, we haven't changed our guidance at this point. and i think what's important is to look at the realized price for methanol. so when we make pricing decisions around the world, we're trying to optimize the realized price for all markets. and when i look at the quarter, there are some anomalies. we have one posted price, for example, for asia pacific. and based on freight differentials and sanctioned product only allowed to go to china, there was some additional pressure in china this quarter. still a very nice realized price in china, but when you look at it compared to asia and one posted price, it really did impact our discounts.
but i'm really happy with how we came out of the quarter. our realized price at three 63 is our best realized price since q3 2018. so i think to me, there is a lot of focus on the discount. but when we make our pricing decisions globally, we're not focused on hitting a target of x percent on the discount. we're trying to maximize the overall realized price for the company.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. and then just a follow-up, maybe an indirect question on g3. can you just talk about how important market share is to methanex. when you look at produced tonnes, commission tonnes, purchase tonnes, i know in the past, you've been roughly, what, 14%, 15% market share of the methanol market. that's obviously come down a bit with titan, chile iv and waitara valley idled right now. can you talk about how important that market share is in terms of your ability to kind of influence where methanol tonnes are going and how that impacts you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i think what's important that is leadership, and we've been the clear leader in this industry, not just on marketing, but safety, responsible care, logistics, proving out new technologies that could go on forever. but we're the clear leader. so leadership is really important. the industry structure is nice. we like the nature of the industry structure. so we think leadership's important. market share is part of that, but we don't get hung up on a particular market share target. but leadership is more important. you're right to point out, we've had some issues in trinidad, chile and new zealand. but i can go back the last 15 years and medicine hat was closed.
we didn't have any production in the united states and we were suffering in -- we had four plants in chile and 0 -- or maybe almost 0 in new zealand. so this is kind of part of our business. it seems like we always have issues somewhere. we have 11 plants running and we're always trying to optimize leadership position as opposed to market share.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
that's great. thanks so much, john.
operator
thank you. our next question, nelson ng rbc capital markets. your line is open, please go ahead.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. and good morning, everyone. first question relates to g3. like have you -- i presume you are looking into it now. but in terms of the labor market, it's pretty hot. can you just comment about the labor market in the gulf coast and what you see there the -- if you're seeing any cost pressures?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll turn the question over to mike herz. he's our senior vice president, corporate development. he's obviously the one that's really in touch with that market down there. so mike?
mike herz -- senior vice president, corporate development
yes. so we've seen changes in activity over the last year, i'd say. we saw a dip, obviously, as covid kicked in, and you saw prices come off or labor materials. and we see more activity today as people see a recovering economy. i'd say from our perspective, i think it's about where it -- our expectation would be that g3 would be about where we thought it before we went into care and maintenance.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would just add, nelson, that we just completed a turnaround there on g2. so we used a lot of labor to do that. and certainly, the -- our experience with labor productivity and availability as well as cost was not any different. we completed that turnaround ahead of schedule and under budget. so i think that's a really good indicator of the labor in the market today. i think one of the challenges when we look to make the g3 decision, that may not be the case a year or 18 months from now as things could get quite heated as economic activity picks up and we could, 18 to 24 months from now, be competing for labor.
and not all labor is created equally. we use different labor at different stages of the construction projects. so i think what's important is to be ahead of the curve when you're thinking about it. and i think today, when i look at g3, the engineering is complete, all the equipment is pretty well purchased. so it's really what i call a lego project now, it's taking all the pieces and putting them together. so it's -- the product has been significantly derisked and it's just around productivity and hourly rates. so we'll think about all those things as we make a recommendation to our board about that g3 project later this year.
also, we built two plants or transferred two plants from chile to there in the last five to seven years. and we're very familiar with the labor in that area. the construction labor, the firms and we have the top-notch firms in the area that we're working with. and we expect if we do restart the g3 project to get their a team, which i think is really important. and those are some of the things that we'll think about as we make a decision.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and if you were to restart construction, would you be looking at a 2023 or 2024 completion date?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's 24 months is our current view. from the day we say we're going to go, about 24 months.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. i'll leave it there. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nelson.
operator
thank you. our next question, matthew blair, tudor, pickering, holt. your line is open, please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
hey. good morning, john. i had a question in regards to the guidance. i think you mentioned similar production quarter-over-quarter. i guess i thought it would have been a little higher with geismar coming out of turnaround. so what would be coming down here? should we think about lower production from chile and i guess, maybe anywhere else?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think i said in my remarks, matthew, that we're coming into the winter months in chile. and we always expect to get lower gas deliveries because as more gas is diverted for heating in that part of the world. in the winter time. so we expect to run the chile i plant through the winter, but probably get lower gas deliveries than we did in q1.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
got it. and then your recent contracts for may in asia and north america indicate better price moves than what the spot market was showing. and i think in the past, you mentioned it's not a perfect link, the spot market can be pretty small and illiquid at times. but could you just talk about what you're seeing in your business that would support stronger contract pricing relative to what we're seeing in the spot market?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're seeing very tight markets, very low inventories and demand improving. so those things usually contribute to a good pricing environment. i'd say in the atlantic basin, which is europe and north america, you're right to point out, very small illiquid spot markets. so they're in some way indicative, but they don't really move markets. for example, most of the business is contracted. so what's more important is the availability of product, getting it there to our customers on time, on spec. as their businesses improve, they're worried about their supply chains and their suppliers' ability to meet their needs.
and i'd say this pandemic has really illustrated that global supply chains have really been impacted. and you can look at a long list of things in north america that aren't available today because of supply chain disruptions, there's just not enough material to go around, whether that's recreational vehicles, lumber. i could go through a long list of things that have been impacted. so i think the availability of methanol, the reliable supply is being prioritized over price today. having said that, in china, there is a real liquid spot market. and i mentioned earlier that sanctioned product can only make its way to maybe china and india.
so depending on how well the sanctioned product operates, we can see instances where more product arrives and can only go to a couple of places. we don't sell in india, but we do sell a lot in china, which does impact the supply demand balance, and can lead to some pressure on pricing in a short-term period. but overall, when we look at asia, besides china which is probably fairly balanced, the rest of the markets are tight. and as demand recovers, we're going to need some new supply, whether it's existing supply to operate better, or new supply coming on in the way of the coke methanol plant to keep things balanced. so it's all about demand.
and i've seen the imf forecast for 6% gdp growth this year and maybe 5% next year, and the u.s. reported 6.3%. so i think those are all really positive numbers and will lead to good demand for methanol. so to me, it's all about reliability and being able to service the demands of our customers.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question, mike leithead, barclays. your line is open, please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
first i wanted to drill down first a bit on demand into the energy markets. i think in the release, you highlighted the strength in mto. but just wondering what you're seeing in other energy applications. obviously, given the rise in oil prices, and what seems like a rapidly growing desire in the world of late for cleaner burning fuel applications. so just curious what you're seeing in there.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. you're right to point out, mto has been quite strong. we saw some growth over q1 2020. and it's the one bright spot through the pandemic. it operated really well and the 90% rates and olefin prices continue to be quite strong. so we would expect those mto plants to continue to operate quite well. if i look year-over-year on the -- what we call other energy, there's been growth there as well. so i think there is more room to grow there, especially on things like mtbe. people have not been driving as much as they normally do in the pandemic. i'd say china is kind of back to normal, pre-pandemic levels for driving, etc.
and with the recent change in the e10 standard, e5, there's a lot more room for mtbe and the fuel pool there, which should be good for demand. so the traditional applications, which make up about 50% of methanol demand are driven by gdp and lots of good signs there right now. so it's hard to predict the future, but certainly, we're seeing a lot of things lining up to see a favorable demand environment, especially as vaccines roll out. and as -- where we've seen vaccines roll out in places like the united states and our geismar area, we've seen cases go way down quite significantly quite quickly.
so our anticipation is vaccine will continue to roll out, and we will see increased economic activity and probably a lot of pent-up demand that should resurface. but again, it's hard to predict the future, but certainly in a better spot today than this time last year.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and maybe just my follow-up question on the g3 decision. i apologize in advance if i'm overly parsing words here. but i think last quarter, you said final decision by summer. today, i think you said later this year. so with some of the uncertainty in the world, is that being pushed out at all? or i'm just reading too much into it?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think you're reading too much into it. we have our strategy session with the board each summer. i think i signaled last quarter that we'll plan to make a recommendation to our board at that time, and that's still the plan. having said that, mike, if we make a positive decision, there'll be a bit of ramp-up time, right? so that's why we're staying later this year if there's a restart -- if there's a further delay, then obviously, there's a further delay. so we're not in a position to make that decision today, but we will make a recommendation by the summer.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question, eric petrie, citi. your line is open, please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, eric.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
so i think you estimated global methanol demand up 5% this quarter. same period last year, it was down 7%. was chinese new year about the same? and can you give an estimate as to how -- impacted methanol derivative demand in the u.s.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're not back to pre-pandemic levels yet. i think i mentioned that in my opening remarks. q1 is always a softer quarter. i mean there's not a lot of variability in our business, but because of chinese new year and the huge impact of methanol demand in china, it's always a little bit below, let's say, q4 or q2 so when we look at q1, sorry, versus q4 last year, but -- in 2020, demand was down about 2.5%, but year-over-year 5%. so we're still not back to pre-pandemic levels, but we're pretty close. and we anticipate, as i mentioned, we'll get back there later this year. so that's our current view.
but having said that, we've now had five quarters of lost demand. we focused demand growth as we entered 2020 at about 3% to 4%, which is around three million to 3.5 million tonnes a year, and we've lost that. so does that come back quickly or slowly? a bit of a guess. but certainly, what we're seeing now is signs and demand could pick up nicely and get back to the pre-pandemic levels sooner rather than later. but we'll continue to watch it and certainly adjust accordingly.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
and i don't know if i heard you say, did you have an estimate for the uri impact? in terms of demand destruction?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
in the u.s.? sorry.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
yes.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, down 6%.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then as a follow-up question, a competitor in trinidad announced short-term gas agreements to restart their methanol plants. could you do the same and then work toward a longer-term agreement? or what's the strategy there?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our strategy was that we -- our 5-year contract ended at the end of 2019. and we have been negotiating, obviously, for some time before the expiry of our contract to get something with the ngc and the government that allowed us to stay profitable throughout the cycle. we weren't able to achieve that. so we agreed with them to go month-by-month and no take-or-pay and we had the village shut down as we thought -- if we wanted to. as we came into the negotiations, we didn't make the progress that we had hoped. and with the pandemic starting up, it was -- titan was one of the only plants that we had flexibility to turn off as well as chile iv.
so we made the decision to turn it off. we continue to negotiate with the ngc. but i think i've been pretty clear, we're not going to restart the plan on a month-by-month gas situation. we have to have something more certain because we have to hire people and spend some tens of millions of dollars to restart the plant. so i'm not sure what our competitor has as far as the month-by-month, and obviously, it makes sense for them to start up. but for us, we're thinking more medium to longer term, and we're still negotiating. we're -- and we're hopeful we'll get something to allow us to restart that plant, but it's not our current view that, that will happen in the short term.
and this is not just a methanol thing on the island. i think the ammonia producers are experiencing the same phenomena, so there is gas. it's just a matter of negotiating something that makes sense over the methanol cycle to allow us to stay profitable. and we haven't been able to achieve that yet.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst

thank you. the next question, john roberts, ubs. your line is open, please go ahead.
matt skowronski -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. this is matt skowronski on for john. you mentioned low global inventories are kind of persist in the market right now. what is your sense for when inventory levels can be replenished to normal levels? and then does this vary by region?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say we're seeing low methanol inventory levels globally, not only in tanks, but at customers as well. so i can't predict the future. i wish i could, but inventories will rebuild if there's more supply than demand. when that happens, i really don't know. but right now, it will take some time if there's more supply than demand to replenish global inventory.

thank you. our next question, joel jackson, bmo capital markets. your line is open, please go ahead.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
alright. good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
hey, joel.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
a couple of questions, i'll do one at a time. maybe john, can you reconcile some of your comments on price that you gave? i'm a little confused. so you gave the guidance in the call earlier that you expect q2 methanol asp to be similar to yet. i mean we already know what the postings are for two months into q2. we know what europe has posted. you're trending $10 to $50 a tonne higher than the couple of months of q1. you said the discount was a little bit inflated, i think maybe give your own words in q1. and then later in the call, you talked about pricing is up, inventory is down and demand looks good. so how can pricing be similar in q2 versus q1?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i guess it's your definition of similar. so we're anticipating similar pricing. it could be better. it's obviously not going to be worse, we think. but at this point, our view is similar.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
how would you define similar?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
similar is close to where we achieved in the past.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. the second question i have is, last quarter, you gave some guidance that you would do about 6.6 million tonnes of attributable production for the year. this year, you didn't provide that in the release, you gave some other kind of plant-by-plant or country-by-country guidance. is 6.6 million or roughly the same number? is it higher? is it lower for this year?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i don't have that number off the top of my head. i'd probably have to take that offline, joel. but i don't want, obviously, for competitive reasons, release a number that people can then backward into our turnarounds and what we might be doing. so let's -- i'll take that offline with you.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
can i just ask why it was ok to -- why were you comfortable releasing it three months ago when not now?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i think when we look at our turnaround schedule and where our productions are region by region, we've got a lot more volatility today. we weren't expecting what happened in new zealand. obviously, chile is a bit of a -- with no argentinian gas a bit of a wildcard. so we're not that comfortable in being specific about that right now.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question, hassan ahmed, alembic global. your line is open, please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
i wanted to just revisit demand. you made a couple of comments. obviously, year-over-year demand was up, but sequentially down 2.5%. and i know there are obviously a bunch of moving parts, chinese new year's and the like. and obviously, the negative impact of uri. but as i sort of take a look at product economics, i mean, the olefins, polyolefins side was super strong in q1. i would imagine mto margins were super strong. asset yield margins were very sort of strong as well. so just trying to reconcile where that sequential demand reduction came from. would you sort of just exclusively attribute that to uri and ex uri demand possibly would have been sequentially up? or were there other factors?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
and just so we're clear, are you talking about q4 '20 versus q1 '21?
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
correct.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so the demand that was lost was mainly in china. when i talk about q4 '20 versus q1 '21, there was about 400,000 tonnes less demand in china, and that was all in the traditional methanol derivatives.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst
understood. okay. all right. and now moving on. again, q1, a bit of a quirky quarter because of be it sort of covid, be it uri and the like. just sort of trying to get a better sense of whether or not you saw any meaningful changes in trade flows. and if i could sort of parlay the iran side as well into this question as well because obviously, new administration in the u.s., i'd like to think sanctions won't be as rigid as they were over the last couple of years. so are you seeing any meaningful trade flow changes? and how are you thinking about iran going forward?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'd call it quirky as well on the trade flows. so we're seeing product come in, in north america from areas that we -- are traditional, let's say. so that's quirky to me. it tells me that there's not enough material in north america to satisfy demand today. and if demand grows, i'm not sure where it's going to come from. coke will start up at some point and probably needed is what i would say if demand continues to increase like we're seeing. with iran, i think the relationships are still strained. again, i can't predict the future. i'm not a geopolitical expert. but is it going to be solved tomorrow? i don't think so. if it gets solved tomorrow, it takes a while to readjust supply chains.
i've mentioned already, there's not a lot of spot market in north america and europe. so let's say everybody is happy tomorrow, we're all friends again. it'll probably take a contracting season for iranian products to start flowing again to europe and korea and places where it used to. so i don't know how it's going to resolve itself with the nuclear deal. there's talking going on, but i'm not on the inside of those talks and how onerous they are and what's on the table. so again, we'll watch what actually happens and then make some judgments about what might happen over time if things normalize. but i think it's too early to make any definitive plans there, hassan.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global -- analyst

thank you. our next question is from cherilyn radbourne, td securities. your line is open, please go ahead.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
thanks very much, and good morning.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
john, i was hoping that we could revisit your view of the mechanical state of the industry supply, if i could express it that way, after a year of covid. and just how that's influencing your view of pricing for the rest of the year.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i can only talk about our operations. i can't really talk about our competitors because i'd be speculating, and i don't like to do that. now we've now conducted three turnarounds in the covid environment. extremely difficult. the provisions you have to put in place to keep everybody safe are quite onerous. i'd say regular maintenance day-to-day on plants is very difficult. as well, we have minimal people on site during the covid environment. so the maintenance that we normally do is probably a lot less in the covid environment than the non-covid. i think when we look at our turnarounds getting experts into the country, it was really challenging in places like trinidad.
and usually, when we do a turnaround, we have 50 people or 30 to 50 people of our own people coming from egypt and chile and new zealand with their expertise to help us do the best possible job on the turnaround because when you do a turnaround, you're doing a lot of maintenance, you're not just changing catalysts, but you're fixing a lot of the things that you've accumulated since the last turnaround. you're also doing a lot of inspection. so keeping plants reliable is really based on maintenance but also inspection, finding problems before they make you go down for unplanned reasons.
so when you don't have all these experts coming in, whether they're you're own or your vendors that have a lot of expertise, you really don't have the same depth of inspection capability and expertise. so all of this, i think, leads to probably potential of having poor reliability over time. then you have countries like iran, as we've talked about, having sanctioned. so whether they can get people in or other country or not, they can't get maybe the materials and the catalysts and different things that they need to do turnarounds. so it's complicated.
we don't talk about the detail here on these calls about a turnaround, but you have 18 -- 100 people on site for 60 days doing a whole lot of work that's been planned for two to three years. so it's really a complicated issue. and i'd say we are seeing plans being less reliable. and there's nothing i see out there that would change my view on that today. but again, it's really hard to predict the future. but i think when we look at our own experience, it's been really a challenge to do regular maintenance and turnarounds.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. i also wanted to get your perspective on the potential for methanol as a marine fuel. and what you think investors should watch to judge the momentum there, which clearly seems to have picked up with interest from maersk.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i know we get labeled as an old boring chemical company, single-product chemical company, which i don't mind. but talk about innovation and r&d, i remember being at the forefront of the standard conversion on methanol way back when. i remember being in front of investors and being -- it's never going to happen, it's never going to work, what are you guys doing. and then we decided with our own ships to prove out the technology, digital field capability and a lot of naysayers at that time. and it's going to be lng, it's going to be scrubbers.
methanol's never going to find its way into that space. and here we are, we all have 60% of our fleet running on methanol over the next one to two years. then companies like maersk and others making the same commitment that all of their new vessels will have this dual fuel capability. so i think it's really exciting. i think it's a great example of our team being innovative, proving out technology and not listening to the naysayers, and the thing works and the thing is flexible that you can use ultra-low-sulfur diesel or methanol, and ships last 15 to 25 years, so they'll have this capability for the life of the ship. and the big winner here is that there is a pathway to green methanol.
there is a pathway to having 100% renewable methanol. i know that's really important for a lot of our customers and for people looking to make choices on fuels. it's not just for today, but it's more of the future. so i think it's really interesting that big companies are now jumping on board and making significant commitments to methanol as a fuel. i've always said, it's not like boilers, it's not like fuel blending, you can have demand changed overnight. but this is -- as ships get built and used. so i've always said it's a mid-decade demand driver. so by 2025, we think the demand for methanol for this application will be good.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
and are there any milestones that we should be watching in the short term to gauge that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think you -- where people are spending their money. where are they making their investments. and there's been a couple of very large shipping companies recently have made a commitment that all their new vessels will be dual fuel. and we've seen our competitors like proman building ships that have this dual-fuel capability. each one of our ships that runs 100% on methanol is 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes per year of demand and 60% of our ships are running on it. that's a demand of around 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes. so in the big scheme of things, not significant, but i think the growth potential is what i get excited about. and once you have this capability, it's there for the history of the ship. so pretty interesting development and will be a driver of demand into the future.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. that's all from me.

thank you. our next question, bernard horn, polaris capital management. your line is open, please go ahead.
bernard horn -- polaris capital management -- analyst
hi. good morning. two questions. first, on new zealand. is there any new update on the causes and resolution of the situation there? i'm kind of -- it seems like it's a very strange one. and i have a follow-up on g3.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. bernie, we don't have any more information than what we've already shared. we know that the suppliers that have run that field, pohokura field are bringing in rigs to do some onshore drilling, but that will take some time. they tell us they're optimistic. they can get back to rates that they had before. but until it happens, we're guiding to where we are. but there needs to be some drilling to correct what's happened with the field.
bernard horn -- polaris capital management -- analyst
okay, thanks. and on g3, when you first commented on the trade-off between starting earlier or later, it seemed like there was some incentive to perhaps getting going earlier. but in your last remarks, it sounded like you were -- it wasn't so easy to get things going right now. so i guess there's that reconciliation in your comments there. but my broader comment is you -- in the post-covid world, do you see any fundamental changes in demand and likewise on the supply side that would mean putting the g3 online might be better to do it a little bit later or earlier in any respect.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have a good view on supply. so post the coke-methanol plant coming on, there's not a lot in the next three to four years. so in the covid environment, nothing has been moved along and nothing's been sanctioned or under construction. so not a lot of supply coming on in the next three to four years. i think the bigger question is demand. so we'll have to come to a view on what demand looks like over the next one to two years. and then as g3 comes up, what's it going to look like in '24. so that's part of the work streams that we're working on, bernie, and we don't have a view on that today. but that will be a key consideration whether we decide to restart later this year or not.
bernard horn -- polaris capital management -- analyst
and lastly, how do you anticipate g3 might interplay with your purchased methanol?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our goal is to have about 20% of what we sell being purchased and the other 80% being our equity molecules. obviously, this quarter, that's changed a little bit because of losing production in new zealand and in chile and titan as well. but i think that's our goal. so if we had a view that we delayed g3, then probably if we didn't have any more -- additional production under new zealand and chile, they will probably look at our sales mix in the medium term. but certainly early days, but our goal is to have 20% of our sales on spot and commissioned product.
bernard horn -- polaris capital management -- analyst
okay. and the g3 wouldn't affect that 20% going forward?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
that's right. i mean we'd lower obviously where we are today on our spot and commissioned sales. and we probably grow our position a little bit as well.
bernard horn -- polaris capital management -- analyst
okay, thanks. that's all from me.
operator
thank you. our next question from jason crawshaw, polaris capital management. your line is open, please go ahead.
jason crawshaw -- polaris capital management -- analyst
hey john, quick question here just on the supply side. as you think about how much capacity was idled by the industry, i guess, over the last kind of six or 12 months relative to how much could come back online fairly easily. if you kind of just give me a rough estimate of how many tonnes that would be helpful. [indecipherable]
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i don't have the number off the top of my head, jason, i'll have to get that number to you. but the operating rate of the industry was lower in the last two quarters than traditional. is that sustainable going forward? i really don't know. but i can get you the number specifically about lost production versus what we call average or normal.
jason crawshaw -- polaris capital management -- analyst
got it. okay. that's good. because i mean, ultimately, the question will be if demand is -- we've talked about greenfield, new capacity being fairly limited for the next couple of years. and if demand is strong, i was just interested to know how much basically latent supply can come meet that demand. but yes, if you can get back to me with that number, that would be helpful. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, what i would say, jason, is that at current pricing, we would expect anybody that can run would be running. so it's not like the supply's off-line because the economics aren't favorable. so in a price environment of $363, every single plant in the world that can run should be running. so the question for me is what are the issues and can they get them resolved and be more reliable. and i don't know. but just on average, if i look at the overall operating rates, we were down a couple of percent q1 '21 versus q4 '20. so a couple of percent on the -- which in an 85 million-tonne market, so what's that 1.5 million tonnes, something like that.
jason crawshaw -- polaris capital management -- analyst
yes. and just, i guess, for my own education, how long does it take to kind of -- if you idle the plant, right, how long does it take to restart?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
it depends on how you idle it. if you idle with the intention of preserving it and restarting it at some time in the future, probably 60 to 90 days, i would guess if everything was to go right. it depends on how -- hiring people and a lot of factors as well.
jason crawshaw -- polaris capital management -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question, chris shaw, monness, crespi. your line is open, please go ahead.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
yes, hi. i had a quick one just on shipping. i assume the market is pretty tight there and i assume your tankers are running full both ways. is that -- is the benefit there ever meaningful enough to margins that we see something significant there? or is it just a little nice little additive thing that you're doing well on the shipping side as well?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the backhaul that we do, which is about 30% to 40% of all the cargoes we carry, are not methanol and their backhauled. all of that revenue goes into cost of goods. so it's netted out in our logistics costs. so it's for us, meaningful. millions of dollars to me is still meaningful. hundreds of millions are more meaningful, but it's not hundreds of millions. so i think you can take a number of 30% to 40% of what we carry, you know our tonnage on our ships and you know the rates for liquid chemicals. so you could back into a number pretty quickly. but that shows in our cost structure, not as a revenue line.
so quarter-over-quarter, depending on the market rates for spot cargoes and coa cargoes, it might change 10% or 20%, but it's not going to drive huge changes in our earnings. but it's some great business we have, and our team has done an excellent job in developing that and gotten really good at cleaning our ships. so we haven't had an off-spec cargo since we've been doing this. so our team deserves a lot of credit there.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
great. that's all i had. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is from roland roche [phonetic] from extra investments [phonetic]. your line is open, please go ahead.
roland roche -- extra investments -- analyst
john, good evening and good morning to you. probably not a surprise to you to get that from one of the largest shareholders, but allow me to go back to the very first question around cash, cash flow and return of capital. so first question is, so you're guiding q2 to $250 million ebitda. you just printed, if i get it straight, $160 million operating cash flow so that's roughly 70% operating cash flow conversion. i think you printed around $100 million of free cash flow, so that's a 50%. now i see that you had a working capital swing of $86 million. i assume that's to go up of accounts receivable.
so first question is how do you guide if you guide to $250 million in ebitda, is it fair to say you go back to what you got anyhow around 70% or 80% free cash flow conversion? or $150 million to $200 million additional cash coming in this quarter, which is almost done. and then the second question, if you allow me, we've been through that. if you look at the g3 stack, i do appreciate there is no decision, although you know what our recommendation is. so if i got the numbers straight, you announced that $1.4 billion total capex, $400 million has been spent. you just announced the $60 million is going to be done. so that leaves me with the $900 million capex left.
and if i get it straight, just to ask you straight, you got a $624 million construction loans, so you could build gf just with the existing construction loan to revolver and then you still sit on a $860 million cash that will go to, hopefully, within the amount to $1.2 billion. so how does that leave all together? are you sitting on a lot of cash? you increased the interest expenses, executive compensation is $18 million. and you're only paying out a $10 million dividend per annum? and when do you think that will be increased? thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our capital allocation hasn't changed, as i mentioned already. our current view is to prefer liquidity at this time and financial flexibility. we will look at what our opportunity to lower our debt and our leverage. i think that's one thing that we'd like to do. we've seen three significant black swan events in 11 to 12 years. so that's had a huge impact on our view of our debt levels. i think the cash on the balance sheet that we'll carry will be more than what we had in the past, especially as we go into looking at projects.
but we'll continue to have a balanced approach, depending on prices above $300 methanol, as you pointed out, we generate free cash even with investments in a project like g3. so we'll look at all of the above, and we're not going to hoard cash. but we'll keep a little bit more than traditionally we have on the balance sheet, and we're favoring probably paying down debt as well at the same time. so i'd say stay tuned. and if prices stay where they are today, we're going to have lots of money and lots of cash to build projects and distribute through dividends and share repurchases. certainly, we're thinking about how to return cash to shareholders.
we did make the decision to cut the dividend, which is a very -- really difficult decision for us. never done that before since we instituted the dividend. and conditions were that we thought that was the right move at the time. so there'll be, again a continued balanced approach between dividend and share repurchases. so nothing's really changed. but if we continue to have this pricing environment, we'll have lots of cash to do lots of things with.
roland roche -- extra investments -- analyst
right. you allow me to go back to the first question because you just answered the second one. so the $86 million?
ian cameron -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes. so roland, it's ian cameron speaking, the chief financial officer. i don't think we've met, but yes, you're right. we did have a working capital build, and that's something that's natural when you have an increase in methanol prices. so our cost of inventory goes up a little bit because of our gas arrangements where we share the upside with the methanol with the gas supplier and also our receivables, as you mentioned in your remarks. and so as you go into a more steady environment, you wouldn't see that anymore but flatten out. and of course, if methanol prices fall, you have the opposite effect, so there's a working capital release. so you were accurate in describing the nature of the $86 million.
roland roche -- extra investments -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. so john, sorry to go back to the second one, one more time that's literally the last one. so what needs to be happening from now to a decision on the dividend?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we need to see demand recovery, which should lead to a positive price environment. and then we'll have to look at our dividend and make sure that we think it's sustainable through black swan events like we just saw. so what level that is, we haven't decided yet, but i think there is room to grow the dividend from where it is today. if we get back to a more normal pricing environment, which today -- if we knew that the pricing today was going to be similar for the next three or four years, that would be an easy decision to increase the dividend, but we're not quite there yet. we like to see how demand recovers.
and like i said in my earlier comments, things are looking positive. but we'd like to see a little bit more recovery in demand and see how vaccines roll out in more normal business conditions.
roland roche -- extra investments -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the last question is steve hansen from raymond james. your line is open, please go ahead.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. thanks. i'll round it out here. john, just one comment you said earlier struck me as interesting is that you're selling a lot of products to china now. i remember a time where you sold very little product to china. how do you think about that environment going forward, given that it is one of the bigger growth markets and you're contemplating in new capacity coming in, of course, in the gulf. so is there additional infrastructure that you would need to service those kinds of growth markets, the tankage, terminals, storage of some sort. i mean how should we think about that just given sort of the regional situation there?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we'll need a few more ships, which obviously, that we've looked at and have in the pipeline. the nice thing about when we buy ships or invest in ships, we have ships coming to their end of their time charter all the time. so we have a lot of flexibility in there, but we'll need a bit more ships. and probably a bit more tankage as well. we're targeting all of g3 to go to asia at this point, and that's our current planning. but getting tankage, we think, is something we can achieve. we're not worried about having enough storage space. a lot -- quite a few of our deliveries as well are direct to customers. so our logistics team does a super job on planning out what we're going to need.
and the nice thing about the g3 is we still have 24 months in front of actually making product once we decide, if we decide to restart the project. so i'm not really that worried, steve, about logistics. our team is really experts in this area. and we have lots of flexibility and lots of options to meet the needs of what we will have from a productive capability. you'll have noted, our production because of titan and chile and new zealand is lower as well. so we still have those commitments for logistics today. so i think net-net, if you look at geismar three versus what we've lost, it's not that much more incremental production. so incremental logistics is not going to be a key concern for us going forward.
steve hansen -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. very good. that's helpful. i'll just close by saying methanol markets are really boring. so don't worry.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. okay. thanks, everybody. methanol is an essential chemical building block used to produce many consumer and industrial items. it's used to make chemicals that form the basis of products used to construct and insulate our homes, automotive components make cars lighter, improved fuel efficiency and then the technology reliance to stay connected. given methanol is a central rule in countless consumer and industrial applications is important as a clean burning and economic fuel, we continue to believe that long-term outlooks for methanol remains intact. we're encouraged by the favorable industry dynamics that we've seen so far in 2021.
we remain focused on operating our -- safely and reliably, delivering secure and reliable supply to our customers ensuring we maintain financial flexibility to deliver long-term value to shareholders. thank you for joining us today. we'll speak with you again in july. and thank you for your interest in our company.

2021-Q2,MEOH,2021-07-29 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation q2 2021 earnings call. i would now like to turn the conference over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead, ms. campbell.
kim campbell -- director, investor relations
good morning, everyone. welcome to our second quarter 2021 results conference call. our 2021 second quarter news release, management's discussion and analysis, and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information by its nature is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcome to differ materially from the actual outcome. certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusions or making the forecasts or projections which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our second quarter 2021 md&a and to our 2020 annual report for more information.
i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex's future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters. for clarification any references to revenue, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility. in addition, we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. these items are non-gaap measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this manner.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's president and ceo, mr. john floren for his comments and a question and answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kim. good morning, everyone. today, i'm pleased to discuss our excellent second quarter 2021 financial results. in addition, we will share our view of the methanol markets, review our operational results and discuss our outlook entering the third quarter. we would also make a few remarks regarding our decision to restart construction on our geismar 3 project, our strategic shipping partnership, and our priorities around capital allocation, including the recent announcement to increase the quarterly dividend. then we will open up the call for your questions.
turning to our financial results. we increased our average realized price in the second quarter to $376 per tonne, a $13 increase compared to the first quarter. adjusted ebitda increased to $262 million in the second quarter, an increase of $20 million compared to the first quarter. we also recorded higher adjusted net income of $95 million or $1.24 per share in the second quarter, an increase of $13 million or $0.17 per share compared to the first quarter. these results illustrate the significant leverage that our earnings have to methanol prices.
now turning to the methanol market. over the last 12 months, methanol prices have rebounded as the global economic recovery continues and vaccines rollout worldwide. current methanol industry dynamics are favorable, supported by strong methanol demand, low global inventory levels, ongoing industry supply challenges, and a constructive energy price environment. we estimate that the global demand, methanol demand increased by approximately 3% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, we anticipate that global methanol demand will surpass pre-pandemic level later this year. strong methanol demand combined with ongoing industry supply challenges around the world and the delayed start-up of new industry capacity additions supported higher prices in the second quarter, with tight market conditions continuing into the third quarter. we estimate that the industry cost curve set in china has increased to approximately $300 to $320 per tonne, supported by rising coal and natural gas prices.
we recently posted our august prices which remained at $542 per tonne in north america and $420 per tonne for asia pacific. we set our european contract price quarterly and our third quarter posted price is eur410 or approximately $485 per tonne. as we mentioned on our call in mid-july, over the last few months we completed a comprehensive review of the medium to long-term industry outlook. we reviewed our expectations for demand growth, the timing for new industry capacity additions, and industry operating rates for new and existing methanol plants over the coming years. based on that work we believe that the methanol industry medium term outlook is positive. and new industry supply will be needed to meet growing methanol demand over the next 5 years.
now turning to our operational results. our second quarter 2021 production of 1.5 million tonnes was lower than the first quarter, primarily due to the lower gas availability in new zealand and chile. in new zealand, our production was lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to ongoing lower gas deliveries. in addition, we agreed to a short-term commercial arrangement with genesis energy to make natural gas available to support a tight new zealand electricity market. as a result, we temporarily idled one of our motunui plants for approximately 3 months. we expect the margin from the sale of gas will be offset, the margin loss from the lower forecasted production volume of 85,000 tonnes. we estimate that production in new zealand for 2021 of 1.4 million tonnes. the upstream gas sector is completing several field development projects that could improve gas availability over the coming years. in geismar our production in the second quarter was higher than the first quarter as we completed a planned turnaround at our geismar 2 facility in the first quarter. we finished the debottlenecking project at our geismar 2 plant in the second quarter of 2021, following the work completed at our geismar 1 plant late in 2020. as a result, our operating capacity for our geismar facilities is now 2.2 million tonnes on an annual basis, an increase of 10%.
completed for [phonetic] capital costs were approximately $125 per tonne for the addition of 200,000 tonnes of capacity. in trinidad our production in the second quarter was higher than the first quarter, as we received full gas deliveries. based on current gas delivery, we estimate that production in trinidad for 2021 to be 1.1 million tonnes, reflecting methanex's equity interest.
in chile, as expected, our production in the second quarter was lower than the first quarter. we typically experience lower gas deliveries in the southern hemisphere winter months impacting our second and third quarters. we should receive higher gas deliveries in the fourth quarter and we estimate production in chile for 2021 to be 800,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes.
in egypt, our production in the second quarter was slightly lower than first quarter due to minor technical issues that have been resolved. in medicine hat, our production in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter as the plant ran at nearly full operating rates.
now turning to our balance sheet. we have a strong financial position with over $750 million in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. this amount reflects our strong adjusted ebitda results in the second quarter and the repayment of $173 million drawn on our g3 construction facility. we've previously announced a strategic partnership, shipping partnership with mitsui o.s.k. limited or mol, with the proceeds of $145 million expected by the end of 2021. this transaction will not have a material impact on our earnings. our waterfront shipping subsidiary generates revenue from shipping methanol to methanex customers and third-party backhaul arrangements. as a result of the partnership mol will be entitled to a proportional share of waterfront net earnings, which fluctuate based on ship volume and tanker market rates. however in terms of our financial statements our ownership of waterfront shipping now and after this transaction is complete, is accounted for on a consolidated basis resulting in a 100% of the revenues and expenses being included in our financial statements. we continue to generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices and have an undrawn backup liquidity, including our $600 million g3 construction facility and our $300 million revolving credit facility.
now turning to our geismar 3 project. we were pleased to announce that our board unanimously approved the restart of the construction of our geismar 3 project, a unique project with significant capital and operating cost advantages that enhance the project returns. an abundant low cost natural gas supply in the us underpins production for this project. in addition, we estimate that g3 will have one of the lowest co2 emission intensity profiles in the industry. ultimately geismar 3 will strengthen our asset portfolio and substantially improve our future cash generation capability. we believe that geismar 3 will deliver significant long-term value to our shareholders. our capital cost estimate for the project is $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, we expect that approximately $435 million will be committed to the project as we end, as at the end of q3 2020 [phonetic] around, through the care and maintenance period. we expect approximately $800 million to $900 million remaining capital cost after resuming construction in october 2021. we are confident in our ability to complete this project on time and on budget. we have substantially reduced the project execution risk profile over the last 24 months. we are well positioned from a labor perspective as construction on our project is ahead of other major capital projects in the region. we have also secured prices for the majority of our bulk material costs, our remaining budget includes allowances and contingencies for both escalation and the remaining risks on the project.
and lastly, turning to our capital allocation priorities. our capital allocation priorities remain the same. we use the cash that we generate to maintain our business, pursue value accretive growth opportunities and continue our strong record of returning cash, excess cash to shareholders. going forward, we will increase our emphasis on financial flexibility in three ways. we plan to hold more cash targeting, targeting a minimum of $300 million of cash on hand, plus the remaining g3 capital cost during construction. we plan to target lower leverage and reduce our debt levels over time to a target of approximately 3 times debt-to-ebitda at methanol prices between $275 per tonne to $300 per tonne. and we will increase our weighting on flexible vehicles for distribution such as share buybacks, combined with sustainable dividend to return capital to shareholders. we recently announced that we reset our quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share. we anticipate that we will have the ability to further de-lever and increase shareholder distributions such as share buybacks in a few quarters at methanol prices of approximately $325 a tonne or higher. geismar 3 is the only significant growth capital in our plans over the next few years. we expect that g3 will substantially increase our cash generation capability and support a significant increase in our future shareholder distribution potential.
now turning to the outlook for the third quarter. we expect to realize methanol prices in the third quarter of 2021 will be similar to the second quarter based on our posted prices so far. we forecast that our third quarter production will be similar to the second quarter. we anticipate our adjusted ebitda results in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter.
finally, i wanted to mention that we recently published our annual sustainability report, we have publicly reported on our sustainability performance since 1997 and continue to enhance our sustainability and esg related disclosure to align with evolving best practice and to support greater transparency and comparability. this year our disclosure is aligned with the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb reporting standards for the chemical and marine transportation sectors. also our disclosures reference some aspects of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures or tcfd and some requirements of the global reporting initiative or gri. we will continue to look at ways that we can improve our sustainability performance and reporting over the coming years.
i would now be happy to answer any questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question is from steve hansen from raymond james. please go ahead, your line is now open.
steve hansen -- raymond james, ltd -- analyst
yeah, good morning guys. john just thinking about chile specifically for a minute. in the past you've gone through the effort of refurbing chile i and then starting chile iv, this is all pre-covid. but just give us a sense for where the gas availability might lie there in the region right now and any plans you might have over time to think about two plant operation. i understand that covid required some reshuffling of the production asset profile. but just getting it done for now that we're in a recovery mode here where you, what do think about that that complex moving forward.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the gas profile in argentina has improved a lot in the last 12 months. we're running our plant right now on chile gas and that profile has also improved in the last 12 months. so our expectation steve today is by the third, late third quarter, early fourth quarter, that we'll be running both plants in chile.
steve hansen -- raymond james, ltd -- analyst
okay, great. that's very helpful. and just, just can you clarify, i missed the number, but the metric that you cited on the cost per tonne to complete the g1, g2 debottlenecking and just now that those two projects are now complete. any other debottlenecking projects that you might be contemplating across the portfolio? thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're always looking to get more methanol out of our existing [indecipherable]. so we're always, have lots of ideas that we look at and execute if they make sense. so we are continuing to look for other debottlenecking opportunities, but nothing to report today steve. the cost for completing the 200,000 additional debottleneck in geismar was $125 per tonne.
steve hansen -- raymond james, ltd -- analyst
very helpful, thanks, i'll jump in the queue.

thank you. the next question is from ben isaacson from scotiabank. please go ahead, your line is now open.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you very much. first question is, given the changing operating in your portfolio over the past year or so, can you update us as to what percentage of your sales go into each of the three or four major methanol markets, depending on whether you grade china out of asia or not? and based on the review that you conducted at the methanol market to restart g3, do you see g3 impacting your regional sales allocation in the future? how do you see that changing?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so we've earmarked 100% of g3 to go to asia in the modeling that we've done for the economics and the irr calculations that we've shared. so that hasn't changed. so if we're able to do better than that and place some in the atlantic basin, obviously that makes the economics even more attractive than what we've already published, really attractive economics. we don't disclose ben where our product goes around the world. it's a very fluid supply chain and we move product to optimize our net-backs as well as to take advantage of certain spot situations that may arise in different parts of the world and to balance out our supply chain and inventory. so we don't really disclose what product goes where.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. and my follow-up is, can you just talk about how the freight market is impacting the company, maybe discuss the magnitude of freight rates versus normal, who is bearing the additional cost, is it methanex or is it built into prices? and i guess you being an active shipper and an owner of waterfront, do you have an outlook in terms of how freight rates will evolve?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, we wish there were a lot higher, i mean despite what we're seeing in container markets and dry bulk liquid tankers for chemicals are still not that great, below what i'd call average prices. so we'd like to see higher prices because obviously we make more money with higher prices and we think we have a competitive advantage on our shipping. so there seems to be still lots of tanker capacity in the world and we're not seeing the same thing that the world is seeing on dry bulk and containers.

thank you. lyondellbasell had an unfortunate incident yesterday with their acetic acid plant. is that methanol unit running, do you know? and will that come into the merchant market here until they can get the acetic acid plant back up again?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't have any more information about that site than what's been reported in the press and i haven't seen anything reported regarding operations. my understanding, based on what i've read, they were in planned turnaround for the acetic acid unit. so it was a planned and they were just starting the turnaround is what i understand, and that's why their contractors were entering the unit. i don't know any more than that, john.
john roberts -- ubs securities, llc -- analyst
okay.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i agree. a really tragic event. and i think it really illustrates all the attention that we've put on safety and process safety, and you can never take your eye off the ball because there was another event in germany this week as well in leverkusen where two other people were killed. so really tragic events.
john roberts -- ubs securities, llc -- analyst
and then since you just updated your longer-term industry outlook, what did you assume longer term for your gas constrained plants, did you, do you assume an eventual restart at titan or eventual restart waitara valley in the longer term outlook or how long do you wait before you think about other options for the equipment that's there.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're optimistic that over time we'll get those plants restarted, we've put a little bit in our 5-year outlook, but certainly not full rates for those two sites.

thank you. the next question is from joel jackson from bmo capital markets. please go ahead, your line is now open.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning, john. coming to a couple of, a couple of questions. i'll go one by one. john, thanks for giving the guidance for q3, it looks like you're guiding to a 19% discount rate again in the third quarter, so third quarter in a row of back. is it fair to say that based on your contracts and what's going on here and that we should be modeling as a placeholder now 19% discount rate, not 17. now last quarter, you had said that the 19% discount rate, a little bit higher than 17 was because of some weak chinese spot prices, the chinese spot prices rose a fair bit in the third quarter. can you help us reconcile all of it?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'm not changing my guidance, joel, on the discount rate at this time. if we think it's a permanent structural change we'll certainly change the guidance, we're comfortable on 17. i think i would look at the overall net-back price, that's what we look at-375 for the quarter was an excellent quarter and generated over $1 billion run rate. so we're very happy with the realized price in the quarter. and we're expecting strong pricing to continue in the second half of this year.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you for that. so, my other question is obviously different investors want different things. you know that being in this role for a long time. and you've laid out and thank you for this, couple of weeks ago what your strategy is will be around buybacks, now you want to make sure on your balance sheet you have your cash buffer, i think you said $300 million and then you would have enough cash on the balance sheet build up to finish g3, so, one other question for you is looking at what the share price is doing, there's a clear valuation disconnect, i think, between the stock price and where your earnings and cash flow power are, where commodity price levels are, typically the finance book says you should be doing share buybacks right, you should be going in the market buying your stock and reducing that disconnect. you have g3, it makes sense why you're doing it, but does this all make you think about maybe changing some of the thought that, maybe you should take on a bit more risk and buyback stock a bit earlier before having all the cash for g3 on the balance sheet.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so our financial strategy has not changed. i mean we fine-tune it, as you point out a couple of weeks ago, but uses for cash that's generated from the business are to maintain the business, grow the business with value accretive projects like g3 and then return excess cash to shareholders. the slight tweak is to have a little bit less on a fixed return to shareholders. so we reset the dividend at 12.5 and have more flexibility to returning cash in a flexible way to shareholders, so at $325 per tonne and higher methanol realized prices, we think in a few quarters as we de-lever a little bit and increase a little bit of cash on the balance sheet for g3 that we'll be able to enter into a share buyback, but our policy of borrowing money is not to buy back share. so any money that we borrow is for the project g3 and remind you we did change our strategy there during covid where our plan was to use the construction loan and to draw on it as we continued on a project and with covid we decided and then replaced that. so the construction with bonds over time and we decided to because the markets were open last september to just go out and get all the bonds, at that time. so that's why we have quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet. but it's allocated for g3 and we're not going to use it to buy back shares.

eric petrie -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
methanex's posted methanol price spread between asia and north america is kind of at a record of roughly $100 a tonne. so how do you think about it? is it sustainable and going forward how do you see that level trending?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we've said for a number of years despite lots of analysts writing to the contrary, that we think the basin balances and price differentials will continue and they are higher than we would have even assumed and that's based on production issues in the atlantic basin. so how long this record, i don't know if it's a record, but it is on the higher end of the differential goes. it really depends on what we and our competitors do with product that we're producing in the atlantic basin. so i can't predict what our competitors are going to do. we know what we're going to do and we would expect that the basin differentials to continue, maybe not at the current levels but they will continue.
eric petrie -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
okay, helpful. and my follow-up question, you mentioned the higher china coal prices and natural gas prices, i think, you know coal was trading around a thousand rmb per metric tonne, double that from recent lows. so how do you see prices of coal going forward and the cost curve evolving into 2022?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there's coal remains quite, we understand not readily available in china and they're consuming a lot for power generation. so if economic activity continues, we would expect coal to continue to be priced higher than what we were thinking. there is two markets in china for coal let's remember, there's the power generation market, which is really set by the government and that's not anywhere near thousand rmb per tonne. and then there is the spot market or the other traded market which, where chemicals and others get their coal and the reason it's a thousand is because of supply demand fundamentals. you're right to point out, gas has really shot up, not only in north america. you know it's almost close to $4 an mmbtu now, but in europe it's at $12 and nobody was predicting that a year ago and that's really impacted methanol, methanol production in europe. there is two plants in holland. one is shut down and the other one is operating at minimal rates because of the high gas prices and you know it's hard to see at this point that those gas prices coming down in the near future based on the, on the inventories that we see in the united states, but you know these things have a way of changing quickly and nobody predicted $12 gas. but i think it's a function of a couple of years 150 gas with no investment. so i always say the cure for high prices is high prices and the cure for low prices is low prices, and that's what we see in commodities.

hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
morning.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
john a question on demand. you mentioned sequentially global demand was up according to your estimates by, i believe 3%. and if i remember correctly, sequentially in q1 demand was down. so the question is, what are you guys seeing or what are you forecasting in terms of demand growth for the remainder of the year? and i guess where i'm going with this question is that again and again you mentioned it, a bunch of other chemical companies mentioned it, about obviously supply chain disruptions that have happened over the last couple of months. inventory is being lean, people sort of back filling sort of orders, probably a function of winter storm uri as well. so just trying to get a sense of where you feel underlying demand is and could we even expect a further bump up from this 3% that we saw in q2?
john roberts -- ubs securities, llc -- analyst
yeah, like i said in my remarks we expect to get back to pre-pandemic levels later this year. so that is increased demand in q3. there are some mto plants that are taking some planned maintenance, the mto industry has been operating at really high rates for a couple of years. and in q2, they operated at 92% which is above our even estimate. so we expect to have them to have some maintenance, which could impact demand, but we expect demand to continue to grow through the second half of this year. a couple of applications are still lagging are the fuels applications, mtbe, biodiesel, those kinds of applications, because we're still not seeing globally a return to normal driving habits, because of the pandemic. so, but we expect those to improve as we get back to more normal habits as people are vaccinated and the pandemic is brought under somewhat of a control.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
understood. and the other side of the equation. on the supply side, obviously a healthy pricing environment and pricing continues to tick up, obviously you guys announced the restart of, or work on geismar 3 but what are you guys seeing broadly speaking in terms of the broader industry supply response and are you seeing any sort of project delays or maybe even people sort of ratcheting up their plans in terms of bringing online new supply.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think having the price environment that we just come through for almost 2 years. a lot of projects that were being thought about were shelved or cancelled altogether. we expect the koch plant to run at some point, now we understand they ran for a bit in july, but they will, they will get lined up and run at some point during this year is our current expectation. beyond that, we have a bit of supply coming on in iran, how it runs is anybody's guess, certainly the track record has not been great. and then, china will add a bit of capacity in the inner mongolia, backward integrate a couple of mto plants and some other plants will come out as more and more restrictions on, on the east coast of china. so net-net, we're not expecting much new supply beyond what's coming in from koch and iran over, over the coming 3 years to 5 years.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst

nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks, good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
morning.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
just a quick question for you, so you mentioned earlier that you were optimistic on gas availability in the various regions going forward. in new zealand, in particular, i think gas production has been pretty low this year. do you have any color on production levels going forward in terms of like production issues, drilling activity, and whether current prices are like incentivizing lower exploration?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll remind you, the gas in new zealand is very wet gas. so there are lots of barrels of liquids and oil prices have any [phonetic] that really helps the economics and they're really going after the liquids. so a higher energy complex in general is positive for our business and that's one of the reasons it incentivizes more exploration and development. yeah, situation in new zealand really was the [indecipherable] field failed and that lost 30% of its production late last year and nobody was expecting that and that's caused the gas market to tighten up quite substantially. the current situation in their winter as well.
they had a lack of rainfall, which is leading to lower than expected hydro power, it's rained again in new zealand. so that situation is behind us now and there is drilling going on. i think that's the positive thing for us is that the upstream owners of the field, maui and pohokura are drilling and planning to drill more, so we'll know a little bit more in the next 12 months. the results of those drilling and like i said, we're certainly contracted for two plants for the, to the end of the decade and we're optimistic the drilling will be successful and we'll see a third might have a reasonable opportunity to start-up as well.
this is not new in new zealand, we've seen this before, and they pretty well develop the reserves and the country needs them. so yeah, we're optimistic, but really i think we'd be modeling a two-plant operation at this point until we see the results of what's happening in the upstream.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks for the additional color. i'll leave it there.

thank you. the next question is from laurence alexander from jefferies. please go ahead, your line is now open.
laurence alexander -- jefferies, llc -- analyst
hi there, could you give a update on what line of sight you have to the amount of global shipping capacity that is ordered or under construction, that would, could use methanol as a flex-fuel and what that could mean for methanol demand over the next 4 years or 5 years. and similarly, what you're seeing in the chinese industrial boiler market development?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, we have eight of our owned ships on order. proman, our competitor out of trinidad [indecipherable] and maersk has one that's what's on order at this time. a loss of other interest. so takes about 2 years to build a ship, laurence. so i don't know how many more orders are going to be placed in the next few years, but we would expect more. each ship around a 50,000 deadweight vessel running on methanol 100% of the time would consume between 10,000 tonnes and 12,000 tonnes. so you can do the math there.
as far as boilers. yeah, we continue to see that market replacing coal, but there's other potential natural gas as well and diesel. so that market continues to be a couple of million to 3 million tonnes of methanol demand and we would expect it to grow.
laurence alexander -- jefferies, llc -- analyst
and do you have a sense in your more industrial or the formaldehyde applications and so forth. what's the kind of level of pent-up demand is? i mean downstream companies are talking about having lost 1% to 2% of volume because of supply chain issues, but there is probably some kind of multiplier effect when we get back up to the commodities that you supply.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'd be guessing laurence and i probably don't have a good guess. but i would agree with the assumptions there is pent-up demand.
laurence alexander -- jefferies, llc -- analyst
yeah, thank you.

matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
good morning, john. it looks like trinidad natural gas production is down about 21% year-to-date versus same period last year. you raised your trinidad volume guidance pretty meaningfully. so, that's just good work from your procurement team or is there anything else going on there?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we did [indecipherable] the supply to 100% of our gas allocation for atlas for most of the year and that's what we've been told to expect for the balance of the year and that's the guidance we provided.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
great. sounds good. and then on our modeling, your implied costs seem to drift up a little bit in q2. would you agree and were there any factors that you can point to? and then as we look at q3. i'm just thinking about the higher net gas environment in the us. i know you're hedged, but could you talk about whether this would be something we should be thinking about for q3 modeling?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, nothing abnormal in our cost structure. quarter-to-quarter, some, there could be a few things here and there, but nothing really, our cost structure is actually quite a bit lower than it was last year as we've taken a lot of steps to reduce it. and as far as, yeah, you're right, we've hedged about 70% of our requirements for g1 and g2. so we're exposed about 30% to the spot market. so depending on what price you're using for q3 versus what you have in your model it would impact us by about 30% of our gas requirement.

roland rausch -- crown extra investments ag -- analyst
hey, good morning john. how are you?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. good, thanks.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments ag -- analyst
well, congratulations on another good quarter. i would like to ask a two-pronged question around liquidity and capital returns also coming back to one of your comments previously around there is quite a bit of cash on your balance sheet. so if i round the updated numbers, i see that the company has paid down 2 net million in debt for this year. it's on over $750 million in cash, if up to four [indecipherable] shipping transaction that's around $900 million in cash, plus there is a $900 million in lines of credits with the $300 million undrawn rcf and the $600 million unutilized construction loan. so i got to a total of $1.8 billion of liquidity.
and then you just guided for another q3 in line, so i assume we are looking at $2 billion in cash and lines of credits by the end of september. where this is a total g3 that's only kicking in next year of 800 to 900, so why do you and your board do not think the shareholders deserve a large dividend or a clear share buyback program? and i want to come back to one comment you made on your recent announcement on the call, where at what prices you would start buy back the shares, obviously, we're on year-to-date lows, so do you consider the current share price level as attractive to buy back shares? thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's attractive to buy back shares, the current price level. i would agree with that. we stated pretty clearly our financial strategy around what we want to do with our balance sheet and returning cash to, to shareholders. that hasn't changed. so we want to maintain $300 million of cash, plus the additional whatever g3 spend is left on the balance sheet. once we've achieved that, we will start to return more cash to shareholders flexibly like we've described and that could, would include buybacks, we reset the dividend and fixed dividend at 12.5 cents and our plan hasn't changed that we'll grow the company and we've over the last 10 years growing the company in down [phonetic], spending about $3 billion and we've returned over $2 billion to shareholders in the same period through dividends and buybacks. so our balanced approach is the same, right now we're spent, having cash generation going toward the g3 project in addition to what's on our balance sheet. and once that is achieved. then we will look to return cash to shareholders. so, nothing's really changed.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments ag -- analyst

thank you. the next question is from cherilyn radbourne from td securities. please go ahead, your line is now open.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities, inc. -- analyst
thanks very much and good morning. in terms of the outlook for methanol supply. i was hoping you could give some perspective on what you think the current environment is like to contemplate a new methanol plant as far as being able to lock in a fixed cost with an e&c partner in light of inflationary pressure and what sort of price deck financial institutions might be prepared to lend on?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a good, it's a good question. obviously that's going to impact us as well post-g3. so it's something we look at all the time, we may have some other brownfield opportunities. but if we're assuming greenfield there's two projects that have been recently completed our public information around and that's the koch methanol plant that's in the process of starting up and the oci natgasoline plant. both of them are around 1.7 tonnes or 1.8 million tonnes, give or take. and they were well north of $2 billion to complete based on public information that we saw, so if you use those numbers that's public that's over $1100 a tonne. and assuming gas pricing in the 300 to 350 range.
and a double-digit return of around 10% to 11%, you would need $400 methanol to get or higher to get that return. so we certainly like and we love $400 methanol for 20 years to get a payback on a project like that, but we've seen quite a bit that of volatility in the last 12 years in our commodity and i think that if i'm a bank looking to lend money to a potential project with those kinds of returns and what you doing on methanol price, it seems in the hard to do category, but having said that, there's lots of, seems to be lots of money out there trying to find a home. so we'll see what happens, but those are the kind of the number cheryl.
cherilyn radbourne -- td securities, inc. -- analyst
and then, second one is, just could you speak to the company's confidence in the view that mto demand for methanol will be stable over the coming 5 years.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, well i guess, we can only look at what has happened in that industry. and what's been going on in a high price and low price environment. so the industry started up 4 years or 5 years ago. that was what we call the first wave, which is just about being completed now, there's a couple of more plants that one is close to completion and one trying to get completed in the next couple of years, and that's what we call the first wave. and as the first wave was being commissioned. there was a second wave and certainly with oil prices in the $40 range and naphtha in the $400 range, it made more sense to look to naphtha crackers than 2 mto plants. so we never expected the second wave and we're not, we're not anticipating. so what we think will happen is what's there will run. we have 85% to 90% operating rates, and i think we can only go on the history when we had $400 plus methanol pricing in 2018. they all ran at high rates, when we had a low olefins cycle last year because of covid, they ran at high rates and they continue to run at high rates. so it's something we watch very closely because it is a big demand driver for methanol and like most things. it's hard to predict the future. but based on what we've seen today. we would expect that 85% to 90% operating rate.

good morning, good chris.
chris shaw -- monness crespi, hardt & co. -- analyst
if one were to take a really pessimistic view on i guess global gas availability going forward. outside of say medicine hat, geismar, what can you mind me what both the potential for moving any of your other plants, ala the first few geismar plants or to another site and it doesn't have to be i guess geismar specifically, but not only the potential, but i guess the economics and i mean is that a possibility at all, any of those plants in the future?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, very unlikely. what we've looked at the kit that we have in the other locations. the way it was built, the way it's installed, pretty expensive to move. we had a unique opportunity, we had two twin plants in chile, and the way they were built, we could lift them up and move them, but i think that was unique to chile i. sorry to chile ii and iii, which are now geismar 1 and 2, but we look at things all the time. but right now our focus is to get those plants running and where they are and we're not giving up any hope yet that we won't be able to achieve gas contracts to allow us to run all of our kit over time. so we've seen this in the history of our company. i mean, we didn't have any production in north america for the longest time and we're going to have 4.5 million here pretty soon, 4.7, i guess with the debottlenecking. so yeah, so our focus is trying to get those plants running based on gas there and not moving them at this time.
chris shaw -- monness crespi, hardt & co. -- analyst
thanks. and then just a reminder, do you know. i can probably jot down the math, but not off the top of my head, but the, your cost per tonne for geismar 3 relative to what it would be for the, when you say geismar 2, when you move similar or it's one lower?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, about the same. we've got it to bit lower, but not significantly. and that's probably going to [indecipherable]. the gas efficiency on the geismar 3 spot is much superior to geismar 1 and 2.

yeah, one of the benefits that we've enjoyed in our company is a low turnover rate, i mean if you compare our turnover rate on average to the industry, not just, not [indecipherable] chemicals and other industry, industry applications like that. we were very low. so where, it doesn't mean we don't have turnover and retirements are becoming a bigger and bigger issue as especially in the western countries as we tend to the aging to retirement age. so i don't have any concern today that we're at risk of not being able to run our plants efficiently because of labor. but it's something we talk about all the time. so things like diversity inclusion are really important to our company and to really expand our labor potential where we can look for new team members is really, really important and each region is a little unique. trinidad, we have all kinds of labor today because of what's happened on that island. in egypt we're employer of choice. and certainly, i'm not concerned in the short-term, but it's something we think about all the time and we want to make sure that we're a great place to work. we pay good wages and that we have people stay for a long, long time, and we're not planning on changing that strategy and philosophy.
steve hansen -- raymond james, ltd -- analyst

john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
okay, well thanks. we're very pleased to share our excellent financial results with you today. we continue to generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices. our capital allocation priorities remain the same. we use the cash that we generate to maintain our business, pursue value accretive growth opportunities, and continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders.
thank you for joining us today and we will speak with you again in october, and thank you for the interest in our company.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the methanex corporation, q3 2021 earnings call.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to ms. kim campbell. please go ahead, ms. campbell.
kim campbell -- investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to our third quarter 2021 results conference call. our 2021 third quarter news release, management's discussion and analysis and financial statements can be accessed from the reports tab of the investor relations page on our website at methanex.com. i would like to remind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking information. this information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated outcome to differ materially from the actual outcome.
certain material factors or assumptions were applied in drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projections, which are included in the forward-looking information. please refer to our third quarter 2021 md&a and to our 2020 annual report for more information. i would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding methanex's future financial performance are effective as of today's date. it is our policy not to comment on or update this guidance between quarters. for clarification, any references to revenue, ebitda, adjusted ebitda, cash flow or income made in today's remarks reflects our 63.1% economic interest in the atlas facility and our 50% economic interest in the egypt facility.
in addition, we report our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. these items are non-gaap measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable than the measures presented by other companies. we report these non-gaap measures in this way to make them a better measure of underlying operating performance and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this matter.
i would now like to turn the call over to methanex's, president and ceo, mr. john floren, for his comments and a question-and-answer period.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kim and good morning, everyone. this morning a few members of our executive leadership team are joining me including ian cameron, our svp finance and cfo; vanessa james, who previously lead our marketing and logistics organization and now leads our corporate development functions, including the execution of our geismar three project, as well as our sustainability function; and rich sumner, who is recently appointed to lead our market team and logistics organization after working for many years with the company in various finance and marketing roles around the world.
mike herz, who lead our corporate development functions, and geismar three project recently retired from the company after 26 years of exceptional and dedicated service. today, we will review our strong third quarter 2021 financial results, discuss our latest views on the methanol market, talk about our operational results and share our robust outlook as we enter the fourth quarter, and we will open up the call for your questions.
turning to our financial results. we recorded adjusted ebitda results of $264 million in the third quarter and adjusted net income of $99 million or $1.29 per share. our adjusted ebitda results reflect continuing strong methanol price environment, partially offset by lower sales of methanex produce ethanol. in the third quarter, we increased our average realized price to $390 per tonne, a $14 increase compared to the second quarter.
our results illustrate the significant leverage that our earnings have to methanol prices. in addition, amid a rise -- a rapidly rising energy price environment, our results highlighted low cost structure and the value of our natural gas arrangements as approximately 65% of our near-term north american feedstock requirements are managed through fixed price contracts. and the majority of natural gas agreements across the rest of the world are linked to methanol prices.
now turning to the methanol market. in the third quarter, methanol market conditions remain tight with ongoing industry supply challenges. traditional methanol demand was flat is various factors, including supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events and global energy shortages, impacted industrial production levels and constrained demand growth.
demand for methanol to-olefins or mto producers was lower in the third quarter due to plant maintenance activities and china's government mandated industrial operating rate restrictions intended to limit energy consumption and energy intensity. demand from other energy related applications was steady. ethanol industry resupply continues to be impacted by various factors.
in north america, hurricane ida and technical issues affecting methanol industry production. in europe, sharply rising natural gas prices and planned and unplanned outages constrained methanol industry production. in china, limited coal supply and government mandated industrial operating rights restrictions as noted earlier, to manage total energy consumption and energy intensity curtailed methanol production.
over recent weeks, global energy shortages and increasing coal, oil and natural gas prices are impacting methanol supply and methanol demand leading to a sharp increase in methanol prices and a significant steep -- steepening of the industry cost curve. we estimate a sharp rise in the industry cost -- cost curve with an average range over the past several weeks for approximately $450 to $500 per tonne.
we have seen significant volatility in coal markets and more recently, we've seen downward pressure in the coal futures market as a result of announced government intervention in the coal market in china giving historically high pricing levels. we recently posted our november prices, which increased by $83 to $692 per tonne in north america, and increased by $90 to $600 per tonne for asia pacific. we set our european contract price quarterly in our fourth quarter posted prices eur490 or approximately $575 per tonne.
starting in january 2022, we are introducing a new posted price for the china market. we will continue to post the asia pacific price for customers in the region excluding china. we're making this change to better reflect the different market fundamentals in china compared with other countries in the region. our outlook for methanol industry is positive and we believe that new industry supply will be needed to meet growing up and old demand over the next five years.
now turning to our operational results. our third quarter 2021 production of 1.5 million tonnes was slightly lower than the second quarter. production in new zealand was lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the short-term commercial arrangement to make natural gas available, support a tight new zealand electricity market from early june to late august. since then, we've operated both from ordinary plants.
we estimate production in new zealand for 2021 of 1.3 million tonnes. the upstream gas sector is completing several field development projects that could improve gas availability over the coming years. in geismar, during the third quarter we shut down our geismar one and two plants as a precautionary measure to ensure that the safety of our team members during hurricane ida.
fortunately, the hurricane only caused very minor damage and we restarted production after approximately two weeks. the production impact of this outage was approximately 100,000 tonnes which offset higher production resulting from the completion of our geismar two bottlenecking projects earlier this year. in chile, our production in the third quarter was similar to the second quarter.
we typically experienced lower gas deliveries in the southern hemisphere winter months impacting our second and third quarters. we recently restarted production at our chile iv plant which was idle for the last 18 months, and expect to operate both plants during the southern hemisphere summer months to the end of april 2022. we estimate production for in chile for 2021 of 800,000 tonnes. our atlas plant in trinidad as well as our egypt and medicine have plants operated well during the quarter.
turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter in a strong financial position with over $900 million in cash, and $900 million of undrawn backup liquidity. we previous announced the strategic shipping partnership with mitsui, osk limited, or mol, with the proceeds of $145 million. we recently finalized definitive agreements for this partnership and closing is expected in the coming months subject to regulatory approval and after all the customary conditions are met.
turning to our capital allocation priorities, we generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices. our capital allocation priorities remain the same. we use the cash we generate to maintain our business, pursue valuable creative growth opportunities and continue to have a strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders.
we recently restarted construction of our geismar three project, a unique project with significant capital and operating costs advantages that will strengthen our asset portfolio and substantially improve our future cash generation capability. our capital cost estimate for the project is 1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. we have committed approximately $455 million to the project as at the end of q3 2021. and we expect approximately 800 million to 900 million of remaining capital costs to be capitalized, before capitalized interest, or approximately $100 million per quarter from october 2021 onward.
we are confident in our ability to come to complete this project on time and on budget. and we have substantially reduced the project execution risk profile. our remaining budget includes allowances and contingencies for both cost escalation and the remaining risks of the project. we were targeting commercial operations at the end of 2023 or early 2024.
with our strong liquidity position and cash flow generation, we are well positioned to fund the geismar 3, project from cash and build on our long term track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. we recently announced that we reset our quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share and commenced the 5% share repurchase program. at this time guys murphy [phonetic] is the only significant capital growth capital in our plans over the next few years. we expect g3 will substantially increase our cash generating capability and support a significant increase in our future shareholder distribution potential.
now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, global energy-energy shortages, shortages and escalating coal, oil and natural gas prices are leading to a sharp increase in methanol prices. we expect realized methanol prices in the fourth quarter of 2021 will be significantly higher than the third quarter based on our current posted price. the forecasts that our fourth quarter production will be higher than the third quarter, as we started our chile four plant in early october.
we restarted our motunui plant new zealand in late august. and we expect to run our guys our plants at full rates without an unplanned two week shutdown due to hurricane ida as well as realizing the benefits of the completion of the debottlenecking project. so as a result, we anticipate our adjusted ebitda results in the fourth quarter to be considerably higher than the third quarter.
we would now be happy to answer any questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question is from joel jackson from bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, john. i have a couple of questions. i'll ask one by one, if that's ok. i think we're in a very complex part of the methanol cycle right now, many of you would agree. when we look at some of the academic or theoretical numbers out there, like, it would seem like maybe methanol is pushing up against its theoretical maximum price, right?
so it seems like the equivalent energy value is similar now for methanol and the gasoline in china, which i think some could argue is potentially the maximum, unless oil and gasoline prices rise further. i know you don't predict the future, but all the things going on, gas, coal, cost curves rising, methanol going up, gasoline prices catching up? i mean, how do you look at that right now in terms of the methanol price environment, where we go from here?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, its supply driven, the current issues and the price rises we've seen in a number of productions, as i mentioned in my remarks, have come off around the world, which is leading to less supply and more demand. and you're right to point out, when that happens, prices will rise, so the marginal demand is impacted to get the world back in balance.
what is that price today? its probably changing every day, based on all the factors you mentioned, coal, natural gas, etcetera. so again, we're a bit surprised on how quickly prices have risen here in the second half, but nobody was planning on the tight energy environment and high prices that we're seeing there. so, again, you're right to say, the future is hard to predict. but, i think, we're enjoying the benefits of a higher energy environment and some supply challenges that we don't expect to solve them themselves in the near term.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then, i went after the buyback, could you able to comment on how much stock you be able to buy back so far in october? based on september public data listed, you're doing about 17 shares a day, which would put your 5% buyback kind of done in about a year or less. is that the idea to try to keep that buyback evenly? and maybe if you want to comment on that, can you please comment on how much you bought back in october so far?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i really can't comment on that joel. but just in general, what we've said is, we want to have the cash on the balance sheet to compete complete g3, which we do now and another $200 million to $300 million. and then everything above that will be distributed to shareholders. so, q4 is looking really solid and we're going to generate quite a bit of cash. and i think by the end of the quarter, we'll reach those targets.
and, we can then look to accelerate the buyback or -- and other options. but right now we have around 5% out there and we think another 3% to 4% possible in the 12 month calendar period. so that's our primary focus now, is to complete g3 and then return all excess cash above $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion to shareholders.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from nelson ng from rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. john, i want to follow up on your comment regarding the supply crunch and your view that it's not going to get resolved anytime soon. like, in china, are you seeing any easing, given i think they had some energy consumption restrictions in china, that have you seen them easing? and i guess, there's the recent steps they're taking to improve or increase coal supply? so, does that help the supply side at all from your perspective?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
i guess it depends on your timeframe. nelson, right now, we're still seeing the dual control, as they're called in china, which is impacting supply quite significantly and demand were coming into the winter months, and natural gas still is a fairly large, raw material for production of methanol in china. and we all know what the lng prices have been like.
and yes, they've -- government has stepped in and made some policy decisions around coal, but we have no idea how long it's going to take for the coal to rebalance in china. and we're coming into their winter where they consume more coal. so, we don't expect it to be a light switch and things to return to the way they were before the crisis on coal and other energy. but directionally, it'll probably always get back to balance at some point, but it's probably going to take some time in our estimation.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then my next question relates to logistics. i know this is a different shipping market, but obviously, the container shipping side has seen a lot of issues, and part of that is due to tight labor markets. have you seen any i guess, delays from your -- from a logistics perspective on your end?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, this is one of our key competitive advantages that we all -- we speak about quite frequently. we have our own ships that we can move around the world to wherever we want. and we have terminal relationships. we have our own terminals. so nothing's really changed in the last quarter. i think i mentioned on the last call that we were seeing some slight delays, because of the shortage of pilots in china. that's adding like a week to two weeks for discharge longer time, and really doesn't impact our ability to service our customers. so fortunately, we're not experiencing the same supply chain issues that most of our customers are and even customers are our customers are.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just one last question on g3. i know you flagged that you've factored in a number of contingencies. but out of the remaining, like $800 million or $900 million of capex remaining, do you have a rough breakdown in terms of how it breaks down into like materials, labor and equipment? i'm just wondering how large the labor component is?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think i've guided to that on projects before and, really there's three big components of the project and labor is the biggest one. like i said before, most of the equipment is purchased. we still have some non-strategic equipment to get on site, but it's really labor. so the two big components are labor rates, which we've guided to, are about the same as when we did g2, and that's still the case today and then productivity.
and, we'll know more about what we expect in productivity as we ramp up the site. so i think we have about 500, 600 workers on the site today, and i think get equals to be over 1,000. so we have a large owner's team, much larger than we had for g1 and g2, and really trying to manage the scheduling the productivity issue, working with our kvr, the engineering contractor on the job.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks. that's good color. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is from jacob bout from cibc. please go ahead.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
good morning.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
morning.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
first question is on methanol demand disruption. i know you said in the md&a, that there was a 1% decline in global methanol demand in the third quarter, are you seeing signs of demand destruction now? i know there's some industry reports talking with mto being evidence to our flow rates and how are things shaping up in the fourth quarter versus third quarter?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
so, we are seeing demand impacted by the controls i've mentioned in china. so, there's limits on how in certain provinces, how industry can operate in the third quarter, which is, which has happened. pricing is pretty volatile in that sector. so, when we're up at 550-ish range, that would certainly would have been economically challenged for some of the mto players, not all.
and then the rest of the world, like i've mentioned, we've seen these high energy prices in europe, for example. so, some customers are cutting back production, because the energy costs are so high, and we had some disruptions in the gulf because of the hurricane. so, i don't expect gas prices to ease in europe in the winter, but we're not counting on another hurricane in the gulf. so we should see demand improvement there. we do worry about inflation as well. we have high inflationary environment, maybe consumer demand wins probably not this quarter, but that's another thing we're watching. so, we're not anticipating a demand drop in q4, but we're watching it closely.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
okay, then my second question is just on gas costs. you touched a bit on this in the beginning of the call, but in your mind us how much of your gas right now is tied to spot versus linked in methanol price and how much of your gases is hedged?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
in north america, we have 65% of our gas hedged for fixed price. the rest of the world is really linked to methanol. so, as methanol prices move, our gas cost move and so about 35% of our gas in north america is related to spot pricing.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
and then how far forward are you hedged in--
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
different lengths -- we've layered in hedges quite some years. so, there's a number of different hedges and we've fixed price for another 10 years and so it's different lengths of time depending on which hedge or which fixed price deal it is.
jacob bout -- cibc -- analyst
leave it there. thank you, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is from edlain rodriguez from jefferies. please go ahead.
edlain rodriguez -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning guys. john, quick question. i mean with methanol prices up significantly, are you seeing or do you believe you might see that the supply response could change in terms of guys pulling forward, the supply coming in?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, we would have expected anybody that could run last quarter should have run hard. and we certainly didn't see a lot of new supplier -- idle supply come on. we're not anticipating any other supply coming on in the quarter. the cost curve, as i mentioned, is still at 450 to 500 range today, over the last week or so. so, i think there's still a really high cost curve that's underpinning methanol pricing. so, we don't expect additional supply to come on in the next few quarters.
edlain rodriguez -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and also related to methanol prices being up so much, like any concerns that the rate of adoption for new applications, like an industrial [indecipherable] like that could be slowed down because of prices getting up so high?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, you know, we're -- when we're looking at new adoption, they're really the adoptions really being driven by environmental issues by clean burning fuels. so they're, we're competing with other potential clean burning fuels, and those prices have also gone up quite substantially. so we don't believe that it will be any impact on adoption of methanol as a clean burning fuel as a result of current prices.
edlain rodriguez -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from mike leithead from barclays. please go ahead.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, guys and congrats on the quarter.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
first question related to demand. i think excluding mto, you talked about energy-related demand being flattish in the quarter. i guess, given the material move higher we've seen all carbon prices globally, you expect to see a pickup in some of these energy markets the next few quarters? or is there just something about the relative pricing of methanol, that's limiting some uptake right now?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think those applications are really mainly for driving not like biodiesel, mtbe, methyl, m100. and, you know, the world's not back to normal yet. people aren't driving the way they used to. so that has impacted in some of the other energy demand as things normalize and world goes -- gets back to normal. and if people get back to their normal driving habits, we would expect those applications to increase for demand.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and secondly, just on the buyback, i want to make sure i heard you write in your answer to an earlier question. it sounds like, given where the cash flow generation currently sits, you'll sort of get where you want to be by year end, in terms of pre-funding g 3, and then maybe you can get a bit more aggressive on the buyback. it sounds like you'd like to hit that 5% authorization. and then if i heard you correctly, maybe a few more percent within the next 12 months. is that how you you're thinking about it?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll be very clear. and so if we want to have around the cash on the balance sheet to complete g3 about 800 million to 900 million left, about 100 million a quarter, we want to have 200 million to 300 million cash on the balance sheet to run the company. everything above that are returned to shareholders and right now is through share buybacks. so that that hasn't changed. and so the more cash you generate, the more we're going to turn to shareholders and the quicker we can do it.
mike leithead -- barclays -- analyst
makes sense. thank you, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from hassan ahmed from alembic global advisors. please go ahead.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
good morning. john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
got a question on inventories. you know, obviously, it's been a very strange year, you know, winter storm yuri, then obviously hurricane ida. i mean, historically, you know, in a rising pricing environment, typically you see restocking, but with all of these events that have transpired, i would imagine, inventories which were lean only got leaner. so, you know, what are you guys seeing in terms of global inventories? you know, how low are they? and how long do you think a restocking exercise would take? when would we get to normal inventory levels? you know -- and how would you see that factoring into demand growth, as you look into 2022?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll ask rich sumner, our head of marketing to take a crack at that.
rich sumner -- senior vice president, global marketing and logistics
thanks, john. yeah, we definitely see low inventories across the supply chain. and when we look to china, we also know that over time, china's growth and market demand in china has put constraints on storage capacity on especially on the coastal markets. so -- and we see low inventories in china coastal markets, and lot of the supply/demand balances that john talked about that we don't think is going to be cured in the short-term is going to further strength to pricing, and it will take some time before we can rebuild inventories in the industry. so that factors definitely supporting current pricing dynamics.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mentioned earlier hassan as well, in europe with high gas prices, some of our customers have curtailed production as well, and that will have to be rebuilt. it really comes back to demand, so we believe there's pent up demand out there still. and as we get back to normal, supply chains will at some point correct themselves, and people will be able to get what they want when they want it. so how long that takes, it's a bit of a guest, but we do believe there's pent up demand for sure.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
very helpful, john. and as a follow-up, a question around medium to long-term supply growth. it's very interesting, last week, on celanese's earnings calls, and as i'm sure you know, celanese has a pretty sizable position in china. so one of the risks that the ceo, sort of, flagged was around their raw materials and raw materials sourcing and supply, and particularly lori, the ceo mentioned methanol, and how supply growth in methanol will not be as robust as it, you know, in the next decade, as it was in the previous decade.
and rather interestingly, she talked about how commissioning is a major issue in china, and now how historically the capital cost advantage that they used to enjoy isn't really there anymore, and a variety of other issues. so the point really being that she sounded quite negative, i guess, on supply growth prospects for methanol, in particular, in china. i mean, obviously, you guys have announced g3, the timing of which in light of these comments seems quite interesting. so what are you guys seeing in terms of call a global supply growth, but particularly with a focus on china?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've been saying the same things for some time, i'm glad somebody's listening. i think we've said in china that directionally, they're not going to grow their methanol production, and where they'll grow it is in inner mongolia, not on the coast where a lot of consumption is, so they're going to need imports and more imports.
energy is an issue, you can see how quickly that's turned to an issue in china. and directionally, they're going to use their energy for eating electricity, and they're moving up the value chain as well, in all industries, not just in methanol, cement, steel, etc. i mean, they're moving away from those industries, and more up the value chain. so those trends have been going on for some time.
and then outside, trying to work and you build a methanol plant today. and you have to have a price of $400, for 20 years in mind to get a double digit return at $3 to $4 gas. so i think everybody's faced the same issues. and that looks hard to do today. and then how do you get it financed in that environment. so i think that hasn't changed and we had a period here recently of 250 pricing for some time, and banks and lenders remember that.
so i think unless you have a strong balance sheet like we do, and cash generation capability, financing these $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion projects are really difficult. as far as us i mean, we're, yeah, g3 is going to be perfect as far as timing, as far as cost structure, as far as emissions and co2 emissions, etc. it's going to be the best in the world, so we're quite happy about it. but for other growth, our focus is on getting our second plant in trinidad restarted and our third plant in new zealand restarted, that's the cheapest way we can grow our production. and that's what we're going to focus on.
hassan ahmed -- alembic global advisors -- analyst
very helpful. john. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is from eric petrie from citi. please go ahead.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
hi, good morning, john.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
you expected methanol demands to return to more historical rates of 3% to 4% next year, excluding china dual control and hurricane weather events?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. depends on your forecast for gdp, assuming, mto operates at around 70% to 80%. and we get 3% gdp growth? yes, we would expect that kind of growth in a high inflationary markets. it's hard to know if gdp will probably be compressed. so that to me those are the two things we watch as gdp and mto rates.
eric petrie -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then will your production, methanol produce tonnes grow in lockstep with that, or do you think you'll do better with the recent g1, g2 expansions? or how should we think about growth and production with your turnaround next year versus this year?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so it depends on gas availability in chile. that'll be what drives our production. we have right now we're running at high rates in chile. and we'll see how it looks there next winter or next summer, but assuming it's similar to this year. i think we don't telegraph turnarounds. so i always say two to three per year. and that's still the guidance. but our debottlenecking is done in geismar, and provided no hurricane events.
we will do better there this next year then this year. and hopefully in new zealand, we won't have to sell on our gas to electricity market next year. but who knows? obviously, we don't want the country not to have heating electricity. so assuming that doesn't happen will be better in new zealand as well. so i anticipate i'd be very surprised if our production next year is not higher than this year.

thank you. the next question is from matthew blair from tudor, pickering, holt. please go ahead.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
hey, good morning, john. given our methanol crisis are, are there any prospects for a short-term opportunistic restart at titan in trinidad?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, short-term is not possible. we don't have the people, if you recall, we have to spend some capital. so we don't have the opportunity to start it off in an opportunistic way. and even if we did, it probably doesn't make sense the amount of money you spend to start it up and not knowing how long high prices are going to last. so we're still focused with the government on a five-year contract that allows us to be profitable through the cycle. and that's still we're focused.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
got it. and then i think on the original modeling functions. you got all the incremental production from g3 going to asia? is that still a good assumption? and i just asked, given the case of demand recovery. and also because it seems like given the size of g3, it's probably lower on the cost curve then from your north american peers, just on thought on that?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're still modeling it that way. but obviously, we're going to try to sell as many of those molecules closer to home, because the economics are better. but i think from a modeling perspective, and we're talking about returns, etc. it was intellectually the right thing to do to say, the worst case scenario, we have to bring 1.8 million tonnes to asia or china and asia. and so we're still modeling it that way. but as things evolve here, if we can sell more in the atlantic basin, obviously the economics improved.
matthew blair -- tudor, pickering, holt -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from adam starr from gulfside asset management. please go ahead.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
you mentioned that you're going to have a separate price sheet for china at the beginning of the year. based on past history, how will the chinese price compare with the rest of asia pacific? and how does your volume breakdown between those markets?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're selling about a quarter in china and about 20% into asia pacific, any given year. you know, in the recent history, i'd say china has been setting the cost curve. so the pricing in china has been lower by the freight differentials to the other markets like japan, korea, southeast asia, it's about $20 to $25. today, and i think the last call, i was grilled quite hard about the discount.
i don't know it hasn't come up today. but, you know, part of the challenge there is we were trying to maximize our overall profitability by setting an asia pacific price that, you know, made sense for all the markets and with china being on average, $20 to $25, lower, it was impacting our discounts. so having the two separate prices, hopefully will, you know, help with that issue. and that's why we decided to go that way.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
but it's really not going to affect what you make. it's just going to be a little more transparent to us.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. that's right.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
thank you very much. also, higher gas prices making the trinidadians more willing to discuss a longer-term contract?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
well, the way, at least the offers that we got, i mean, even at these prices, we'd be making very little ebitda from a price sharing mechanism that we saw. so i don't know what our competitors are paying, but that's what we were offering.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
okay, because they're missing a pretty good boat right now but and in chili, do you-and there is still potential for higher gas supplies down the road or is there drilling going on? is there new gas being developed?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, there's new gas on both sides of the border chile and argentina. you know, and i think i've mentioned before, we need to do some maintenance work on our chile i plants in the next few years as well to get to higher rates, but the gas availability is improving in the southern basin.
adam starr -- gulfside asset management -- analyst
okay, thank you very much and appreciate the outlook.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from ben isaacson from scotiabank. please go ahead.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you very much and good morning. two back to basics questions for you, john. first one is on the cost curve. you mentioned marginal cost is somewhere in the 450, 500 range. over the last few weeks prices have been higher than that, which suggests we're in a demand-driven market right now where pricing is based on affordability and not on the cost curves. so my question is, now that we're seeing pressure by the chinese government to push coal prices lower, and at some point we will see european gas prices coming off in the spring. will that not push methanol prices lower? or are we truly demand-driven and affordability is pumping all else right now?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i call it supply kind of interruptions are driving. there's not enough supply to meet demand and we're probably saying the same thing. there have been in europe, you have to see gas prices fall quite substantially to even today's prices to allow restarts so the idle capacity there. and in china, we'll see how the coal market develops and there's many things that go into what methanol producers pay for coal in china.
it's not just the index that you may read bloomberg or wherever -- wherever there's a lot of different factors. so you're right, i'd say the -- we've been about above whatever the cost curve has been most of this year and until supply catches up to demand that's probably going to going to be the case.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you for that. my second question is, the relationship between oil and methanol is quite complex. there's direct relationships, there's indirect relationships, there's perceived ones, etc. and i'm just trying to understand we're at $80 oil now, a $10 change in the price of oil? can you just remind us what does that mean for methanol and from methanex, whether you think about demand or pricing cost curves, affordability whatever it may be?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there's not really a link between oil and methanol, there's no real substitutable products and in the demand where a higher oil price or lower oil price will lead to less demand for methanol, but generally i mentioned a higher energy complex is good for methanol pricing, because of cost curve moves up because some supply has to come out. and demand for methanol into energy applications, which are really being driven by environmental issues, with containers to be to grow. so i think there's no really no link in our minds between the price of oil and the price of methanol on any given day.
ben isaacson -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you.

thank you. the next question is from roland rausch from crown extra investments. please go ahead.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
hey, john, it's roland. how are you?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good. how are you roland?
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
hey, sorry, i might be the third person you're going after that share buyback disclosure. but can i just wrong a couple of probably common understanding points. so number one, the roughly 150 million cash in i assume you still expect in q4 so its that pro forma that you are roughly at the 1.1 billion you mentioned before. is that correct?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and plus we're going to get some hopefully the money from the mol sale at global.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
yeah. okay, understood. and then i know you guys did a great job. and i guess it was july 16, where you laid out kind of, i think it was 865 actually, i'm talking about g3 capex? is any of that changed? i think it was 100 in q4. and then i think the large 410 in 2022, and then around 300, 350 in 2023. and again, i don't want to pinpoint you, because i know that it's moving target. but is that roughly still what you guys expect us as capex may have for g3?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so our guidance hasn't changed on the capex for g3. we have large contingency as i've mentioned in those budget numbers, as well i mentioned in my opening remarks about 100 million a quarter is how you should model the spend on g3 until completion.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
okay, so basically, again, i know you answered it in five different ways already but if that sale proceeds come in, are you there to redeploy any free cash flow back to share buybacks or is that is that too, too aggressive to model?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, we are buying back shares every day to day. so i feel as we get closer to our targets flow can accelerate that buyback and think about a second one --first in the next 12 months.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
and just one more on this, i assume there are certain blackout periods on when you can buyback share, right?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
no, there are blackout periods when we can change the rate of buybacks. but we can saw it at certainly month like getting close to quarter end, we can't change the rate, but we can give an order to buy x amount of dollars per day throughout a blackout period.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
okay. all right. that's all i had. thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, roland.
roland rausch -- crown extra investments -- analyst
and best of luck for the next quarters. yeah.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. the next question is from john roberts from ubs. please go ahead.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
good morning.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, john.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. how far out do you think the first sequestration project is for a world scale methanol plant? would that be more than five years out do you think?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
capital we're looking at it ourselves, especially in north america for medicine hat and for geismar and the capital costs is quite substantial. so i think without some sort of government help, subsidy or involvement, it's probably longer than that is what i would say, john, but governments are pretty bullish on reducing carbon and this is one way to do it.
so i know the alberta government and louisiana government are both very interested in carbon capture and storage. so we have a team working on it. and if and when, you get the fid on it, it's probably a couple of years to build it into the plants. so five years? i would guess five. i'd be hopeful that within five years, we'd have one invoice.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then there was some mto in china that was being back integrated into coal. has the coal situation in china setback those projects or are they still proceeding on plan do you think?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, two have been completed and they're running. we haven't seen any impact. so how we manage that, as we include those in our supply additions were some of the publications include them as demand losses, so it's a little bit of eggs, apples, oranges, sorry. so those are -- those have happened. and we are expecting another mto plant consuming 1.8 million tonnes of methanol to come on in the next six months. so that will have an impact on demand as well. but we haven't seen any change in the backward integration recently based on the coal prices.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the last question is from joel jackson from bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing one more for me. john, if i remember how some of your gas contracts work with your price -- the methanol price share mechanisms, that after kind of the limit, like when methanol prices are very, very low, the bad part of the cycle, or methanol price are very, very highly, i guess now it's high end cycle, did some of those -- some of those price sharing is different may not be as linear? can you just comment on that? do you know as ethanol prices now versus say $100 lower to the contracts, did price mechanism farmers look a little bit differently?
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
you're right, they're all a little different. so the guidance we give is on average. and in general, i've used this for years. at $200 methanol, we're paying about two bucks for gas, at $300 about three bucks and at $400 about four bucks. so that's the guidance we give. it's not exact, obviously because each contract is different. and as we renegotiate, they're all changing, depending on the price markers, etc, etc. but just in general, the higher we go from ethanol, the more we're going to pay for gas.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
john floren -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, thanks very much for all the questions. we're very pleased to share excellent financial results with you today. we generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices. our capital allocation priorities remain the same. we use the cash to generate to maintain our business, pursue value, accretive growth opportunities and continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. thank you for joining us today. we'll speak with you again early in 2022. and thank you for the interest in our company.
