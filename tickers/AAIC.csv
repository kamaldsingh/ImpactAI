at this time, we'll open the floor for questions. [operator instructions] our first question comes from jason stewart with jones trading.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jason.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
on the leverage, on -- in the quarter i mean net settlements, it looked like, took leverage down on average through the quarter but at period end we're sort of heading into this environment where you've listed a lot of positives leverage is already up. i guess my question is, are you comfortable with where it should average out during the fourth quarter based on the september 30 or is there more opportunity to increase leverage based on your view of the investment environment?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i think, jason there is certainly the potential to increase leverage, some. i'm not sure i would suggest people to expect that. i think we may. i think it's just as likely that we remain about where we are, or about where we sort of were at the beginning of the quarter, which was somewhat increased from the third quarter -- excuse me, from the second quarter, but roughly in line with the third quarter end. and with the potential as spread opportunities improve that we may increase that -- at the margin. and i would say, i would emphasize that the margin we've been clear over time that we expected that no one should be surprised over time leverage came down, i think that's been the case. i think we're comfortable approximately where we are, but we do have the flexibility to move up a little bit if we deem it best given spread opportunities.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
understood, understood. and then on the repo funding we typically see some pressure going into year end as dealers deal with inventories. this year is a little bit different, i think your average repo was a little less than 30 days. have you started taking anything over year-end, and your comments, it sounded very positive that the markets were functioning well. and i'm just wondering if you've executed over year-end and seeing any prints in that market over that date?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
there is year-end, over year-end repo available. i wouldn't say, it's a massively big market from what we can tell. right now, we have started that process. we expect to increase that process over the course of the month and the quarter. so we've gotten under way but it's not yet clear how deep that market is through year-end. and i think the potential for some pressure over quarter end is still does exist. i think the overall repo market is far healthier than it was. but there are still, there are still the potential for pressures around year-end. we are working on alleviating that ahead of time as best we can and we've begun that process.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
all right, and that's fairly normal. but it's fair to say that you didn't see much impact from the hiccup and you're not necessarily expecting to see much impact outside of a normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, is that fair?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's fair.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
okay, cool. thank you very much. i appreciate it.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
and i would say this, we've been pleasantly surprised by the over year-end levels that we have seen so far.

christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
rock, given the...
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
hey, chris?
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, rock. hey, rich. is -- given the migration to mid-coupon rmbs, is the guidance that you gave last quarter for low double-digit, high single-digit returns on book value, still hold or is there a change on that?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, there is a lot of variables in that. as you well know, forward curve, how fed funds and repo spreads play out, those are important and i think the prior question and answer sort of responded to part of that equation. speeds are relevant portion of that, speeds continue to be elevated and we'll see how that progresses over the course of the fall -- the rest of the fall, pardon me. and when the seasonal pattern start to kick-in, there may still be a bit of pent-up refinancing, that flow through the system in the next month or so. and then maybe after that we start to see the seasonal effects come into play and help out on the yield side with somewhat reduced prepayment at that stage. i think overall that arena for roe returns, it's probably fair. i think today, the margin they would probably be based on these conditions at the higher end of that range for new investments. but we've also seen that return opportunities have moved around over the course of the last few months as the market is adjusted to new fed policy. today they are in fact at the higher end of that range and those are the -- based on the key points that we pointed out in our script.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's it for me.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from mikhail goberman with jmp securities.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
hello gentlemen, can you hear me?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we can.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
excellent. sorry about that, not sure what happened there. thanks for taking my question. can you potentially give an update on book value performance in the fourth quarter so far? what you're seeing?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i think it tracks what i said in the script, mortgage performance through maybe the middle part or maybe a little later part of october was weaker. and since that time has been considerably stronger to the point that i'd say overall since september 30th performance is flat to modestly improve.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and maybe some thoughts on what you're seeing in tba versus spec pools today?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, today, we would still favor spec pools. the prepayment risk in the tba side continues to be somewhat challenging. and returns are body through the coupon stack. so we say some are negative, and some are slightly positive, but carry pretty meaningful prepayment risk from the universe, the broader universe. so we would still continue to favor spec pools here.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
got you. thank you.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
for the prepayment protection.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
right. and i apologize if you had recovered this pro forma line cutoff for a minute or two earlier. but what is your outlook for prepay speeds in the fourth quarter? a lot of -- a bunch of your peers have sort of mentioned that, october was pretty high, november could be pretty high as well but you expect kind of a huge seasonal drop in december but as a whole what do you expect for the fourth quarter?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i sort of hit on that with my prior response, i think our best judgement around, it would be that, first of all, the october and november speeds meaning september to october that were reported in early october, november were about the same. they are about relatively flat and we alluded to that in the script, at about 13, a little under 13.5 for us. and we wouldn't be surprised if those elevated speeds continued for a bit later into the year this year than maybe in some others, as a consequence of the pipeline of financing activity -- mortgage financing activity that's built up in the system. so there might be some of that volume to come through from the lower rate environment, over the next month or maybe two, but we would expect after that to see the seasonal effect take place and late in the year those speeds to come down seasonally and through the first quarter. all of that would depend on rate levels of course. so rate levels lower probably equates to higher speeds and rate levels higher probably equates at somewhat lower speeds. but i think from a calendar perspective, we would see elevated speeds through the fourth quarter and then moderating late in the fourth quarter and into the first.
mikhail goberman -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much. thank you for your time.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.

richard konzmann -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rich. good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2019 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is brian bowers, our chief investment officer. during the third quarter, the continuation of a weakening global economic outlook ongoing trade tensions and declining inflation expectations led the federal reserve to lower its target fed funds rate twice during the quarter and once again at the end of october. despite these actions by the fed the yield curve continue to flatten during the quarter. the two to 10 year treasury curve declined by 22 basis points to 4 basis point as of quarter end, as the weakening economic outlook drove long-term interest rates meaningfully lower leading to heightened interest rate volatility.
intra-quarter, the 10-year treasury rate fell 55 basis points to 146 basis points in early september before retracing some of that rally to close at 1.66% as of september 30, a decline of 35 basis points during the quarter. prepayment speeds on mortgages, increased significantly during the quarter in response to the strong rally in interest rates through the course of the year, as well as normal seasonal patterns. in mid-september, a much-publicized market dislocation in the repo funding markets led to a substantial spike in overnight government repo rates, the fed responded by adding substantial liquidity to stabilize repo funding markets through its open repo market operations and announcing its intentions to expand its balance sheet a very positive step for funding in our business.
high prepayment at speed expectations heightened interest rate volatility on a flat interest rate curve led to an increase in risk premium in mortgages resulting in agency mbs underperforming interest rate hedges during the third quarter. while the company shift an investment concentration toward lower coupon and specified agency securities, mitigated the impact of the company's results for the quarter both higher coupon and generic tba agency securities, under-performed lower coupon and specified agency mbs with favorable prepayment characteristics during the quarter.
since september 30, agency mbs performance relative to interest rate hedges has been flat to modestly improve. the continued flattening of the interest rate curve elevated prepayment speeds and higher repo funding rates relative to libor, had the effect of compressing net interest spread returns on levered agency mbs during the quarter. however, while these pressures continue to weigh on portfolio returns since september 30, funding conditions have eased and return opportunities on new investments have improved as yield curve has steepen, repo funding rates have declined materially and agency mbs spread widening during the third quarter is captured on new investments.
turning to our actual results for the quarter, we reported a gaap net loss of $0.23 per share and core operating income of $0.18 per share. as of september 30, book value was $7.35 per share, reflecting the modest widening of agency mbs spreads relative to benchmark interest rates. short-term recourse leverage, measured as the company's repo financing and tba commitments, less cash to total investable capital was 9.9 times as of september 30. the decline in core operating income from the second quarter was due primarily to lower average leverage and lower average asset yields, partially offset by more favorable net funding costs.
the company's average leverage during the third quarter was 10.1 times, a decrease of over 1.5 turns from the prior quarter. the weighted average cpr for our specified agency mbs was 12.85% during the third quarter, an increase from 10.16% during the prior quarter. as a result of these higher prepayment speeds, as well as the shift to lower coupon agency securities, the weighted average effective asset yield on our agency mbs portfolio was 2.96% for the quarter, a decline from 3.21% in the prior quarter. the company's weighted average cpr for october and november was 13.46% [phonetic], which we expect could result in a weighted average effective yield of approximately 2.78% for that period.
given current interest rate levels, we expect continued elevated prepayment speeds. but our transition to additional lower coupon specified pool securities with lower premiums should moderate increases in prepayment speeds going forward. the company's continued shift toward lower coupon securities that carry lower premiums and prepayment risk increase the company's agency mbs concentration in lower coupon 2.5%, 3% and 3.5% mbs to 57% of its total investment portfolio at september 30, an increase from 27% as of the prior quarter-end. the company also increased its portfolio concentration of specified agency mbs with low prepayment characteristics during the third quarter, while significantly decreasing its exposure to generic agency tba, that carry higher prepayment risk. as of quarter end, 98% of the company's agency mbs portfolio is comprised of specified agency mbs, compared to 86% as of the prior quarter-end. while repo rates were lower during the third quarter, reducing interest expense on unhedged repo, repo rates relative to libor remained somewhat elevated and above the receive rate on the company's interest rate swaps, offsetting the repo interest benefit in that period.
during the third quarter, the company's weighted average repo rate was 2.46%, an improvement from 2.64% in the prior quarter. however, as a result of the fed's actions to both lower the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, since the start of the third quarter and to provide substantial liquidity to the repo markets. current repo funding rates and conditions have improved materially. today, one month repo funding rates have improved to approximately 185 basis point versus the average rate on our repo balance at september 30, up 235 basis points.
as a reminder, the company enters into interest rate swaps, for which it pays a fixed rate and receives variable rate based on three-month libor, in order to lock-in its funding cost for a portion of its repo funding for the length of the swap. from late in the second quarter through the third quarter the interest rate swap market priced in expectations from multiple federal reserve cuts, leading to a significant inversion in the short end of the interest rate swap curve versus repo funding cost. the company took advantage of this opportunity by increasing its short-term rate swap positions by approximately $1.1 billion, during that period to effectively lock-in much of the markets previously anticipated federal reserve cuts into its net funding costs.
as of september 30, 81% of the company's repo funding was hedged with interest rate swaps. and as a result, the company's weighted average fixed pay rate of its interest rate swaps was 1.82% during the third quarter, a decrease from 2.1% during the prior quarter. while spread pressures for agency mbs do remain, the outlook for return opportunities on new investments today has improved for several reasons. first the fed's three rate cuts since the start of the third quarter of lowered current funding cost appreciably. second the fed's recent actions to stabilize the repo markets have improved repo rates relative to libor, benefiting net funding costs for agency mbs.
third, the widening of one month to three-month libor since quarter-end also benefits net hedged funding costs. fourth, the yield curve is steepened with the 2 to 10 year treasury widening over 20 basis points in september 30. and fifth, the mortgage prepayment speed expectations have begun to moderate. in summary, the company is positioned to benefit from improvements in current net spread opportunities in agency mbs, which should allow the company to deliver attractive returns to its shareholders.
operator, i would now like to open the call for questions.
",2019-Q3,AAIC

[operator instructions] we will now go to our first question. our first question comes from josh bolton with credit suisse. please go ahead.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, guys. good morning. i appreciate the disclosure in the deck around the incremental levered returns on agency versus credit. curious, do you have a target percentage of capital allocation for the credit segment? or how are you thinking about how large that bucket could grow? and then additionally, do you have any thoughts around the pace of growth that we could see in that segment over the next 12 months? thanks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, josh, the pace of investing and the ultimate exposures will depend on the market conditions as they evolve over the course of time. conditions being as they are today, we would continue to expect that the mortgage credit investment portfolio would grow as returns in that segment are at least equivalent to, if not higher than agency returns and offer other appealing characteristics that i noted in the script. and so i think that would be today the first focus. and i wouldn't put a number on it, but i wouldn't suggest anyone be surprised if they see that portfolio grow in investable capital over the course of the year on a prudent basis based on where opportunities may be and may grow as high as double over the course of time. that's an ongoing process. as you know it's dynamic, but -- and it would be a prudent process of a potential expansion in that portfolio. but we can see that it may grow materially over the course of the year to the extent that opportunities continue to be relatively more attractive on the credit side versus the agency side.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then just one on the interest rate sensitivity disclosure. looks like during the quarter, the portfolio shifted to be much more negatively exposed to higher rates. curious, if that's something intentional reflective of your macro view of rates, or just any commentary around the rate environment and how your agency portfolio is positioned would be great? thanks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i guess, my first comment to that would be that actual performance in agency's in down rate scenarios has probably underperformed versus modeled expectations that you see in these standard presentations and the opposite is true. the recent historical experience has been that they have tended to outperform in up rates, or steepening environments to a certain extent and to a certain level. so, i would say that this posture reflects the recent experience, the convexity embedded in these assets today and the difference -- observed difference between actual prepayment developments and market expectations as rate changes and curve shape changes have occurred.
i'd say it also reflects a broader commentary -- a broader observation on the macroeconomic backdrop. it is a consequence of all those things. we've driven the coupon -- the average coupon, the average price, the average pay up in the portfolio down sort of programmatically over the last couple of quarters and that's ongoing with a focus down primarily to the 3% coupon spec pool block of assets.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for the color, rock.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from trevor cranston with jmp securities. please go ahead.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
so i'm wondering, if you could provide some more color around the new credit strategies in terms of how we should expect those investments to be structured? it looks like at december 31, the assets are to show up on the balance sheet as mbs and mortgage loans. but i was curious, because you described them as co-investments, if the expectation should be that those will continue to show up as mbs and loans, or if there's potential for things like joint ventures to be showing up on the balance sheet at some point?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i think for now probably expect more of what you've seen, described in the financials that -- i suppose that could potentially change over time. but for now, for the immediate term anyway, i think, probably expect to see securities and mortgage securities and mortgage loans represented as you saw them in the fourth quarter. rich, do you have any different commentary on that?
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
no. i think that's right. literally, in our next quarter or so, down the road certainly opportunities for more of the latter what you spoke of trevor in terms of more direct investments in joint venture type of opportunities.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
we alluded to a discussions ongoing with new potential investments and partners. and some of those would be exactly along the lines of that you described, trevor, but those may take a bit of time to further develop.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got you. and then as these develop and you said that you're working with sourcing partners, should we expect there to be any additional expenses showing up on the income statement associated with the new strategies? or how is that going to play out?
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, i think, it's rich, trevor. you may see a little bit more g&a costs associated with it, but i think there's going to be offset with some savings you'll find in other places. there's certainly some more diligence costs and other types of things that we have to incur, as it relates to expanding into various mortgage credit opportunities. but again i think those costs will generally be offset in the end by savings that we'll see in other places.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's right. i think there will be higher -- somewhat higher costs around the initiation and the origination of those assets and potentially around personnel. i don't think -- i don't expect it to be dramatic at all. and i do think there are opportunities for other expenses to run down over the course of '20 as it compared to '19. and so i think in the end you'll probably, more likely than not you'll see cost savings come through on a net basis over the course of 2020, because i think the potential cost savings will exceed or meaningfully exceed and incremental expense required to initiate and originate and undertake these investments, including potential joint ventures.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got you. and then the last question on the mbs structured investments you've made so far. can you say where you've been investing in the capital structure? if it's more toward first loss-type investments, or if it might be higher up?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
it depends. it's variable. i'd say it does include sort of elements of the capital stack down toward the first loss, but in very low ltv situations, and it includes non-first loss positions in those with a bit higher ltv characteristics. and in either what we're looking for is the combination of ltv, seniority and cash coverage levels that we're entering into an investment with a higher ltv, but then we're expecting that those cash coverage levels would be quite high and other factors that may offset that.
some of these opportunities are also relatively short. and we like the short, sort of relatively short duration of that credit exposure. and some of the others that are longer have more moderate and attract lower ltvs and other characteristics. so it's a nice blend of duration and attachment point and generally low external -- very low external leverage on those and attractive cash flow characteristics attached in all of those cases.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. appreciate the comments. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann. please go ahead.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, rock. when you are on the new credit strategy, when you're discussing joint ventures and so forth, are you talking about partnering with property developer or so, and investing in equity? can you clarify that for me, please?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
with -- i think it would be along the lines of partnering with originator, servicer type folks principally for lenders, in particular, specialist fields that sort of thing rather than sort of equity and commercial real estate development, that's probably not top of the list. it's probably not even present on the list at the current time. but investments -- co-investments or joint ventures with originator, servicers and specialty lenders in their field, who have long track records and appealing asset characteristics are the kinds of things we have engaged in and we expect to continue to engage in.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. thank you. and also, with this new strategy include things like the freddie mac k-series, which would require -- into the lower tranches, would require consolidation of the securitization on your financials?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
it's something that we have reviewed the k-series. we have not participated in it down thus far. i wouldn't rule it out, potentially down the road, but thus far it's not been a principal focus to date, and i would say isn't right at the moment.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. final question. roe targets, its really...
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
we feel like, chris, that we can derive better opportunities in other comparable, but not k-series securities loans.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
okay. thanks. finally, earlier about a couple of quarters ago, you gave sort of guidance for high mid-single digits, low-double-digit roes, any update to that?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, we hit on it in the script by alluding to the fact that the returns available in the mortgage credit segment under current conditions, seem to us to be in the range of the low to mid-double digits. we stated 11% to 16%. we think that's representative. i think agency returns, on the other hand, while they have improved, the prepayment speed uncertainty is still meaningful and that creates risks that are different from the mortgage credit environment, and probably an 11% is the top end of what one might be able to achieve on a new dollar invested in agency in a lower coupon head security spec goal.
so you just -- that volatility, we feel in the present environment is lower in the credit side and the returns are the same or higher. so far, our experience has been, as i said in the script that they're higher with lower leverage and other appealing characteristics. so, we think sort of the programmatic nature of evaluating and undertaking originating these assets will be beneficial over time. and to the extent that the agency returns evolve over time from high-single digits to maybe 11% at the max today, then we'll continue to consider that. but for now, the primary focus under current market conditions and returns for credit assets would be first on the credit side, and the ventures -- and the discussions in ventures we have in progress with the potential partners as we speak.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. thank you, rock.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason stewart of jonestrading. please go ahead.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
great. thank you. rock, you talked about obviously the joint ventures. it sounds like the true business migration into credit, but at the same time you mentioned, it might have been an opportune, or it sounds like it could have been an opportune time to acquire credit assets in the fourth quarter. could you go through maybe those two different points as it relates to the commercial versus the equity investment and it sounds like sfr? just how those two played out in terms of the cadence of investing. so we could get a sense for how that might play out going forward in the return profile?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
so, we've -- i think what i tried to say in the script, jason, is that we're investigating across all these spectrums, right? so we're investigating the single asset the specialty cmbs, single asset, single borrower, small commercial in particular, direct originated tailored or sort of specialized industry-specific commercial mortgage loans that's sort of one bucket, and then on the other hand loans that are secured by residential property, i.e. business purpose residential transition loans, potentially non-qm. and right at the moment, sfr is not the top priority, but it's possible. it's in the spectrum of things we're evaluating. it's probably something that isn't top of our list right at the moment. but we are looking at it. and at some point, it may be appropriate if the returns and risks justify themselves, if that be added to the mix, but not at present maybe down the road potentially.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay. so was there any single asset opportunity that sort of [technical issues].
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
say that again, jason, i couldn't understand the question. you were breaking up.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
i'm sorry. was there a single investment, an opportunistic investment in the fourth quarter, or was this all part of the strategic thought process?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say it was -- in a way all of the above, right? this was a process that we highlighted for folks over the course of the middle and latter part of 2019, that we are investigating. we were undertaking discussions with a variety of parties over that period of time, as we completed that phase of our evaluation, we focused on these particular areas. and in the fourth quarter, we came across some opportunistic situations that are quite appealing with experienced sourcing partners, experts in their field. and that provided a particular opportunity.
it wouldn't surprise us to see that, if we were to see more of those opportunities in the course of the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. i'd say those were more in the realm of on the commercial side. and then in 2020, the focus has included the -- those loans secured by residential properties as well, i.e. the fix and flip business purpose securitization that we executed and continue to look at very, very closely and evaluate opportunities intimately in that space.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. and mr. tonkel, there are no more questions at this time.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i would just say, jason, one more thing in each of these silos what we're seeking is sort of programmatic nature of opportunities with potential partners doesn't mean we won't be opportunistic on individual situations that come to our attention, we will be. but what we're seeking to develop is a sort of a programmatic effort here across what we think are attractive credit silos with great characteristics and attractive returns and that will help overall reduce the leverage of the company, improve its returns and diversify its risk. so those are all programmatic focuses that we're seeking to have in place.
thanks everybody for your time. and if you have any further questions, we'll be happy to answer them post the call.

these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which are subject to change, risk and uncertainty as a result of possible events or other factors. these and other material risks are described in the company's annual report on form 10-k and other documents filed by the company with the sec from time to time, which are available from the company and from the sec and you should read and understand these risks in evaluating any forward-looking statements.
i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks. thank you, rich. good morning, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is brian bowers, our chief investment officer. during the fourth quarter, as improved economic outlook, as a result of federal reserve monetary policies and lower global trade uncertainty led to a risk on move in the global financial markets, which drove an increase in the 10-year us treasury rate and a steepening of the yield curve. the 10-year us treasury rate increased 26 basis points during the quarter, ending at 1.92%, and the two to 10 year us treasury curve steepened 31 basis points. in addition, swap spreads widened 8 basis points, benefiting agency mbs portfolios hedge with interest rate swaps. on the funding side, the federal reserve's 0.25 points rate cut in october along with its actions to provide substantial liquidity to the repo funding markets were significant positive steps to funding in our business. against this backdrop, price performance of mortgages were strong in the fourth quarter, as the spread between the yield on agency mbs and benchmark interest rates tightened meaningfully with pay up premiums on specified pools performing particularly well in light of the rise in mortgage rates. since the start of the new year, global economic concerns surrounding the impact of the coronavirus and other macroeconomic factors have led to a rally in the 10-year us treasury rate and some retracing of the steepening of the yield curve that occurred in the fourth quarter as well as higher market prepayment speed expectations for agency mbs. against this backdrop, agency mbs have performed relatively well in early 2020. turning to our actual results for the quarter. we reported gaap net income of $0.72 per share and core operating income of $0.18 per share. core operating income was unchanged from the prior quarter as the benefits of both lower funding costs and g&a expenses were offset by lower asset yields and leverage. as of year-end, book value was $7.86 per share, an increase of 7% from september 30, reflecting the tightening of agency mbs spreads. the company's total economic return measured as the change in book value plus common dividends declared was 10% during the quarter. as of today, the company estimates that its book value per share has increased approximately 1% since december 31. short-term recourse leverage measured as the company's repo financing and tba commitments less cash to total investable capital has moderated to 8.7 times as of december 31 from 9.9 times as of the prior quarter end. the weighted average cpr for our specified agency mbs portfolio was 12.11% during the fourth quarter, a decline from 12.85% in the prior quarter. although, our agency mbs asset yields benefited from these lower prepayment speeds, the weighted average effective asset yield on our agency mbs for the fourth quarter declined to 2.81% compared to 2.96% in the prior quarter, due primarily to a shift to lower coupon agency securities. to begin the fourth quarter of 2020, the company's weighted average cpr was 10.47% for the months of january and february, which we expect would result in a weighted average effective asset yield of approximately 2.84% for that period, a modest increase from the average yield in the fourth quarter. given current interest rate levels, we expect continued elevated prepayment speeds. however, our transition in the agency mbs portfolio to lower coupon specified pool securities with lower premiums, should moderate increases in prepayment speeds going forward and their impact. and our shift in strategy to incorporate mortgage credit investments should reduce agency mbs prepayment sensitivity in our book value and earnings over time. with its shift in agency mbs investment concentration toward lower coupon securities that carry lower prices pay up premiums and prepayment risk, the company's investment in lower coupon 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% coupon mbs was 72% of its total agency mbs portfolio at december 31, an increase from 57% as of the prior quarter end. in addition, all of the company's agency mbs investments as of year-end were in specified agency mbs with favorable prepayment characteristics as the company did not hold any generic tba securities that are more sensitive to higher prepayments. during the fourth quarter, the company's weighted average repo rate was 2.09%, an improvement from 2.46% in the prior quarter as the company's funding costs benefited from the fed's rate cuts. however, term repo funding rates were somewhat elevated at year-end, with the company's weighted average agency mbs repo rates at 2.1% as of december 31. repo funding rates have improved since year-end with the company's weighted average agency mbs repo funding rates at approximately 1.75% currently. as of december 31, 83% of the company's repo funding was hedged with interest rate swaps and the company's weighted average fixed pay rate of its interest rate swaps was 1.82% during the fourth quarter unchanged from the prior quarter. during 2019, we highlighted the company's increased focus on and evaluation of mortgage credit opportunities across various sectors. consistent with that, during the fourth quarter, the company actively shifted its investment strategy to incorporate a broadened spectrum of mortgage credit assets in addition to its focus in recent years on agency mbs. initially, the company's expanded strategy encompasses specialty mortgage assets across a limited number of selected sectors, which better leverage the company's long-standing relationships skills and resources. recognizing that the current economic and investment climate is constructive but mature, we are particularly focused on tailored or directly originated opportunities with attractive and protective credit characteristics and where possible scores [phonetic] are created in partnership with specialists in their fields with long experience originating, underwriting, financing and servicing in their investment disciplines. arlington has had lengthy relationships with these partners in many cases decades long. some of these areas of investment focus may have future branding opportunities for arlington and its partners as well. taken together, we believe a basket of these specially selected, directly originated and tailored opportunities will diversify the company's risks, reduce leverage and enhance returns and earnings as well as reduce prepayment, volatility and repo financing exposures for the company. these sectors include specialty real estate lending segments such as large single asset, single borrower cmbs transactions, small balance commercial cmbs, industry-focused and specialized direct originated commercial real estate loans, as well as residential property-backed mortgages like business purpose, residential transition and non-qm residential mortgages. these assets offer significant characteristics such as attractive ltvs, cash coverage and total debt ratios with targeted roes ranging from approximately 11% to 16%. they also offer diversified funding sources, including permanent financing in certain cases and they are generally either liquid or offer access to liquidity. the company began selectively allocating capital to these mortgage credit opportunities with potentially higher risk-adjusted returns during the fourth quarter. as of december 31, capital allocated to the company's mortgage credit investments totaled $57 million, representing 14% of the company's investable capital. the company's mortgage credit investments as of year-end consisted primarily of single-asset single-borrower commercial mortgage investments and small balance commercial mbs with attractive risk-adjusted returns. to start the year, the company has continued to evaluate and add new mortgage credit opportunities as it believes the risk-adjusted returns are higher than current agency mbs returns. during the fourth quarter of 2020 [phonetic], the company invested in an equity investment in a non-agency securitization, collateralized by business purpose mortgage loans also known as residential transition loans secured by residential homes for which the borrower holds the property for investment purposes. following these initial mortgage credit investments, we have observed overall improved returns on invested capital combined with a reduction in the overall corporate leverage by almost two turns since the beginning of the fourth quarter with this prospect of potential further reductions in leverage as mortgage credit investments expand. the company is optimistic about the return opportunities available to shareholders from a prudently executed shift to a broader and more active investment strategy, which now includes a discriminate focus on mortgage credit investments as well as agency mbs. in summary, the company's initial disciplined investments in mortgage credit opportunities totaled 14% of investable capital with roes expected of 11% to 16% and attractive credit characteristics. second, arlington has sourced or co-invested in these initial investments with a number of premier partners and is currently in discussions with additional potential partners for direct originations of credit assets. third, observed returns on invested capital have increased and overall leverage is down by nearly two turns following the company's initial mortgage credit investments. fourth, agency mbs spreads are currently attractive with spreads wider than historical averages. in addition, federal reserve actions to cut interest rates and provide liquidity to the repo markets have significantly lowered the company's current funding costs and a supportive economic landscape should be a tailwind for our mortgage credit investment strategy. and finally, cost efficiencies are available in 2020 to reduce the expense burden on capital and enhance the company's returns to shareholders. in summary, the company is positioned to benefit from improvements in current net interest spread returns in agency mbs, as well as opportunistically investing in selective mortgage credit investments at potentially incrementally higher relative returns, which should allow the company to deliver attractive returns to its shareholders. operator, i would now like to open the call for questions.

thank you. at this time, we will open the floor for questions. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from doug harter with credit suisse.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. doug, on the [technical issues] process around buyback or returning capital to shareholders, given the significant discount to book versus buying new assets?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, as you'd expect, doug, that is something we certainly spend a lot of time looking at and thinking about. naturally, the first thing that we contemplate is we think about are our larger mission. i think one of the key ingredients in that process and for us is naturally the importance of liquidity in providing opportunity for -- to absorb whatever additional challenges may come from these market circumstances as they develop in an uncertain path over time as well as to provide the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in the securities on our own balance sheet, as well as longer-term opportunities that may create quite exceptional returns over time for shareholders that are available in markets and may become available in markets including, as i said, potentially platform type opportunities that we are seeing and in discussions about right now.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then if you can just give us a little more detail about the continuing commercial loan that has leverage? kind of what are the details behind the loan and just any extra color there would be great?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
i would say it's a -- it benefits from sort of ideal location, number one. number two, it's a specialized and very sensitive critical operation type piece of -- set of real estate assets that support a critical function operation. the detail is in the 10-q as well. but i would say, overall, it's exhibited ideal behavior, reasonably ideal or ideal behavior as one might expect through this type of period of time of volatile economic circumstances.
and i think that's a combination -- that's due to a combination of its critical function as well as the credit quality built into the loan itself, the collateral, the liquidity, the coverage ratios and those sorts of things. and i think that all flows through to the bottom line in the form of no margin calls on that asset. and again, it is financed with very long-term repo. so there's not a financing risk there.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from trevor cranston with jmp securities.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
i guess -- so, when you guys were discussing the new investment opportunities and the capital you've deployed in april, i think you characterized them as discounted unlevered investments. can you provide any additional color there in terms of what you guys are looking at and buying, whether its loans or securities and kind of what the types of collateral you're looking at?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
i would say a combination. we're seeking return circumstances that reflect what i described in terms of credit and collateral protection; liquidity in most cases not necessarily every case, but in most cases, and where there's not absolute liquidity those are naturally adjusted for in return expectations. the predominant focus has been in the residential spectrum and we are -- and we continue to see very interesting opportunities there.
we are seeing front pay securitizations in rpl and other similar type assets that have cash carry in the mid-to-high single digits, discounted in nature and carry total returns that are above that in the most senior part of the cash flow stack. and then we see others that are -- maybe either a little less liquid or have a couple of other variables to them that we see generating opportunities for return in the double digits, low-to-mid double digits.
and then we're also seeing some other opportunities that carry higher returns than that, which may have a platform aspect to them over time. and so those sort of break it down, again, i think the characteristics that we illustrated in the script speak pretty well to the kinds of emphasis we're providing in our process of identifying and evaluating new opportunities, a combination, but residential primarily, senior primarily, liquid primarily although not exclusively, and very robust from a credit perspective with attractive returns that on balance are going to be in the low-to-mid double digits.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got it. that's helpful.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
taken together.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
sure. and you mentioned that some of the new investments you're looking at they were through existing and potentially new partners. is this stuff you've done so far? is that -- are those direct purchases by you guys or are there some structure with another investment partner in what you've been buying?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
today, it's more of the former. although as we speak, we're engaged on a number of situations that are -- that look more like the latter that also can provide opportunities, we think, with returns -- sort of in the higher end of the spectrum that i illustrated before.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. okay. and when you described the investment environment, it sounded like you're obviously much more positive on the credit side as opposed to the agency side. do you have any thoughts as we progress over the next two, three quarters how much of your capital you might be willing to shift into credit investments and away from agencies?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, that depends on how markets adjust and adapt to this economic shock as it develops over time. i think i illustrated our thoughts on the agency side. if that were to change materially, well, then that would suggest we should reconsider it. i would say we're always sort of adjusting to where those markets are and expected returns associated with a new dollar invested of capital and in each side, the non-agency and the agency. so -- and there may be more than one way to play the agency opportunity. so we're investigating other alternatives to be involved in the agency resi space and even other agency spaces.
and i think we'll continue to emphasize those over time as long as agency, direct agency mbs returns with what we would be comfortable in a leverage profile are yielding what we think to be single digits somewhere, whether it's sort of mid-to-high or to high single-digits, appropriately levered, in our view then we'll be focusing on these other characters -- these other assets, which on an unlevered basis can certainly compete or exceed the -- not the agency opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis over time.
keeping in mind, again, the emphasis there on the non-agency side, the credit side, would be short duration, very strong credit and collateral protection, currents in the solidly single digits, mid-to-high, maybe even low-double digits cash yields, and total returns higher than, on an unlevered basis, loss adjusted. so that competes pretty well with agency as we speak here. and as i said, there may be opportunities related to the agency space that also allow for those kinds of opportunities on an unlevered basis or low -- very -- or very low leverage basis.
for now, we continue to -- for now, we're focused on those. and to the extent markets shift and those types of opportunities in non-agency become more expensive and drive the returns down, well then we can look back to agency if that has become also less expensive in the near to intermediate term.
i don't think any of us necessarily expect the agency support from the fed to be immediately removed. but to the extent that that or other effects cause a reduction in agency prices that's material enough to widen those spreads and give us a chance to reenter with a new dollar at better returns, well, we always have our eye on that.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
alright, ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, rock. excuse me if you mentioned it earlier, but what are you targeting in leverage ratio going forward with the new strategy?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that relates directly to the question that i just answered. i think it will depend on how circumstances and markets evolve over time. and to the extent that the emphasis, given market conditions remains on the non-agency side with the approximate parameters that i described in here and in my answers and in the script, then i would expect that our leverage would continue to be on the low side and sort of reasonably in-line with what we have and what i've disclosed -- what we've disclosed in our script and in my comments.
to the extent that the investing environment shifts over time and suggest that a new dollar may get a better risk adjusted return in agency, to the extent agency conditions change over time, well then the leverage would naturally be increasing associated with that. so it's -- i wouldn't say we have a specific target. i think i try to illustrate in the script and in my comments the objectives for our investments on the credit side, which would be low leverage across -- generally across the board, low-to-no leverage across the board.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
okay. great. and then...
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
in that segment.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and then in terms of liquidity, how much you're looking to cash keep on the balance sheet going forward given everything going on?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, as a general matter, you can probably divine from my comments that we are emphasizing maintaining substantial liquidity and we think there is an opportunity to create these kinds of attractive returns, provide an attractive overall return to the shareholders and yet still keep a very significant liquidity pool available for absorbing market shocks should this economic pathway prove more turbulent over the next six to 12 months than it has been already.
so we would provide a meaningful protection layer against those kinds of ongoing or more severe shocks in markets. and at the same time that liquidity can provide positive optionality for us to take advantage of dislocations as they occur along that economic recovery pathway or a decline pathway.
and i would say that we would hope that that would include a platform opportunity along the way or one or more along the way that we could take advantage of with the substantial liquidity pool that we expect to keep in addition to making these attractive investments with the characteristics we have described.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. final question. i guess it's for rich. are these new, i guess real estate assets, are going to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value or cost and are you going to break down the cost and fair value for each property?
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, we don't have any real estate itself on our balance sheet. we're talking about if we have a mortgage loans and yeah, investments in mortgage-backed securities. so everything has been -- we've elected a fair value option for all of our investments. so everything is carried on our balance sheet at fair value.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. okay, that's it for me guys. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. our next question comes from jason stewart with jonestrading.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. on the agency portfolios, spec tabs are back to, call it, mid-february. when you think about that versus tbas, could you just describe a little bit more about your thought process given your comments on prepays and what would cause you to shift added spec pools?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'm not sure there's a lot right now that would cause us to shift out of the limited spec pool position that we have, jason. the role has experienced a lot of movement and it is subject to pretty significant forces that can emerge in short periods of time. and we all -- i think we all fully understand that the underlying quality of that pool continues to probably deteriorate over time given the circumstances from a speed and predictability perspective.
so i think we would probably emphasize -- continue to emphasize the spec pool side just simply from a predictability perspective and that we would sort of adjust for pay-up risks through adjustments -- movements along the coupon stack, but also adjustments in the size of that portfolio and capital allocation to it or away from it at a given time based on how expensive we view the basis to be and the pay-ups to be.
so i would just say keep that in mind. we might use just the overall scale of capital dedicated to it and moderate that up or down to adjust for that, the relative expansiveness of the basis and the pay-ups, and that would cause us to be potentially holding excess liquidity or moving capital to the other side of the book and as spec pay ups or the basis get cheaper, we would come back to -- we may come back to agency.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay, that makes sense. and then on the credit side, you talk about total return. if you could just link the two components of total return, cost discount accretion and cash carry to the way you think about the strategy, capital allocation and the dividend that would be helpful. thanks.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
jason, we just missed the first part of that. could you just repeat that? pardon us.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
sure. so when you think about the allocation of credit, i think probably two components cash carry and discount accretion, if you could just relate the two of those as you weigh capital allocated to that strategy and as you think about the dividends that would be helpful.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we sort of spoke to it in a way in the script, right? we see on the types of investments that we're primarily targeting, we're seeing cash on cash yields in the mid-to-high single digits to start with, some certainly in the double digits. so i'd say on balance, presently, we see a cash on cash yield that would be in the high single digits with expected returns in the low to maybe mid-double digits in total.
and i think we're comfortable -- that we're comfortable that over time as this capital is fully utilized, put to work into those kinds of investments, then we'll be able to certainly comfortably manage a dividend over time that would be acceptable and appealing to shareholders and provide for some potential upside above that as well through the non-cash component of the earnings or from upside potential from a platform or otherwise.
so i think to frame it maybe 75%, 80% of the expected return in that book is going to come from cash yield, cash -- current cash yield and the rest from either an accretion of the discount toward the loss adjusted par or spread compression if that occurs in a shorter time period. and keep in mind most of these are very short duration, so that accretion period to the extent it exists is abbreviated.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. there are no additional questions at the time.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer

good morning. i like to welcome everyone to the arlington asset first quarter 2020 earnings call.
[operator instructions] i would like to now turn the conference over to richard konzmann. mr. konzmann, you may begin.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning. this is rich konzmann, chief financial officer of arlington asset. before we begin this morning's call, i would like to remind everyone that statements concerning future financial or business performance, market conditions, business strategies or expectations, and any other guidance on present or future periods constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of factors, risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations or current circumstances.
these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which are subject to change, risk and uncertainty as a result of possible events or future factors. these and other material risks are described in the company's annual report on form 10-k and other documents filed by the company with the sec from time to time, which are available from the company and from the sec and you should read and understand these risks when evaluating any forward-looking statements.
i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rich. good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2020 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is brian bowers, our chief investment officer.
during the quarter, the global health crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic rapidly led to an unprecedented forced shutdown of large portions of the global economy. the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the economic impact of the pandemic quickly led to extreme market volatility and dislocations in the financial markets resulting in significant spread widening on most fixed income assets, interest rate volatility, a sharp sell-off in equities, substantial liquidity strains, and significantly less price transparency of financial assets.
during that period, agency mortgage spreads widened significantly until actions by the federal reserve to aggressively resume purchases of treasury securities and agency mbs, improved the liquidity and functioning of the financial markets and led to a tightening of agency mortgage spreads by the end of march. severe dislocations in the market for non-agency mbs also led to substantial declines in the market prices of non-agency mbs during the quarter.
repo funding for high quality assets such as agency mbs continued to function at relatively normal levels. however, the repo funding markets for more credit sensitive assets, such as non-agency mbs were strained, characterized by limited availability as well as increased pricing and haircuts.
repo margin calls along with fund redemptions led to selling pressure in mortgage investments, contributing to the decline in pricing during the quarter. in the latter part of february, as it began to be apparent that financial conditions were deteriorating, the company proactively shifted its focus to de-levering and increasing liquidity and the company continued this approach of prioritizing liquidity through the end of the quarter.
notwithstanding aggressive federal reserve monetary actions and policies, as well as record fiscal stimulus, market conditions continue to be constrained in certain sectors and rapidly evolving across many sectors. as a result, the company has maintained a relatively cautious stance, which prioritizes preservation and protection of the company's balance sheet through low leverage and substantial liquidity. through this volatile period the company continued to meet all of its margin requirements in the ordinary course while maintaining its strong relationships with all counterparties.
the company reported book value of $5.28 per share as of march 31st. core operating income for the first quarter was $0.17 per share, a decline of $0.01 per share from last quarter. as of march 31st, the company's investable capital was allocated to 85% to agency mbs and 15% to mortgage credit investments. book value since the end of the quarter has improved by approximately 2%.
in order to maximize its liquidity, the company did not declare a dividend on its common stock during the quarter. the company's fourth quarter common stock dividend declared back on december 13th and paid on february 3rd of this year will be applied to the company's reit distribution requirements for 2020.
this prior quarter dividend along with its tax loss carry-forwards provides the company with a great deal of flexibility in managing its reit distribution requirements this year. the company will evaluate future common and preferred stock dividends based upon multiple factors, including overall economic and market conditions, return opportunities on investments, company's ongoing liquidity needs and reit distribution requirements.
although, the financial markets have improved since the lows experienced in march through aggressive federal reserve monetary policies as well as record fiscal stimulus, market conditions continue to be constrained and rapidly evolving in many sectors. the company has continued to maintain a stance, which prioritizes preservation and protection of the balance sheet through low leverage and liquidity. accordingly, the company is taking a patient and selective approach to redeploying its capital or increasing leverage in the current environment.
steadier funding conditions and lower repo funding costs as a result of recent federal reserve interest rate cuts have provided support to agency mbs. however, after substantial widening in the mortgage bases and precipitous drops in specified pool pay-ups, during the lead up to the peak of market deterioration in mid-to-late march, prices and pay-ups since that time have elevated significantly due to substantial federal reserve purchases of agency mbs and its ongoing support for agency mbs funding markets.
with the federal reserve as the marginal and non-economic buyer, agency mbs valuations have become relatively expensive, while at the same time there continues to be great uncertainty in the path of prepayments, although they are expected to remain elevated. this has had the effect of compressing available yields below 1.5% and toward 1% or lower for some coupons, shortening agency mortgage durations further and creating the potential for material extension risk, as well as price pressure to the extent federal reserve support subsides.
notwithstanding the credit protection and liquidity associated with agency mbs with available levered returns on a new dollar invested generally in the single digits with appropriate leverage, we remain relatively cautious on levered agency mbs exposure.
the company's current non-agency investments are reasonably balanced between residential and commercial credit with about two-thirds currently dedicated to residential collateral, 85% liquid cusip collateral, 85% discounted or deeply discounted bond, 70% senior-first pay, leverage at is 0.3 time through long-term repo only with expected overall returns in the low teens and representing approximately 25% of capital currently. these characteristics reflect what we are targeting.
the recent dislocations in financial markets have laid the foundation for opportunities in mortgage related and other credit assets with attractive returns with no or low to modest leverage. for a range of residential and commercial loans and non-agency mbs, available unlevered returns currently range from the low to single digits for the most liquid and most senior assets; and high single to low double digits for other senior credits and collateral types, depending on liquidity, seniority, leveragability, funding costs, and return volatility under stress scenarios.
the company is actively identifying and evaluated various investment opportunities like these through both proprietary and non-proprietary channels with existing and new partners. as of today, we are currently well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities with our overall low leverage, substantial liquidity, zero non-agency mbs repo, and only one piece of long-term repo on a senior mortgage loan with very strong collateral and credit characteristics which has received no margin calls. we also have the benefit of our historical experience investing in assets that generate unlevered returns in the high teens through prior stressed economic cycles.
based on current conditions, we are executing a plan which focuses on investments that provide acceptable returns on capital while retaining sufficient liquidity to both sustain substantial ongoing financial flexibility through various market conditions and benefit from the optionality to capture opportunities from situations that may arise over time, but that may not yet be clearly visible during these earlier phases of this economic shock.
while the current stage of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus supporting markets may make some of these opportunities somewhat more challenging to access, we are having success identifying, evaluating and investing in them. we've capitalized on the benefit of our financial flexibility during the second quarter to make attractive investments with these characteristics and as conditions permit, we expect to continue that over the course of coming months.
in april, the company made new unlevered investments and discounted mortgage and related credit assets with attractive characteristics totaling $44 million. however, we expect second quarter earnings to reflect a period of underinvestment as the company selectively capitalizes on these attractive available opportunities over time which may not fully be reflected in the earnings power of the company immediately.
a key investment objective is the realization of double-digit overall returns on investments while retaining a low-to-modest overall leverage profile as well as substantial liquidity in order to sustain financial flexibility and to capture attractive returns with potential platform upside created by ongoing dislocations as the covid-19 related economic shock reveals its full impact over time.
in summary, with a flexible financial and liquidity profile characterized by low leverage, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that have been created from the current economic environment that should enable the company to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns to shareholders over time.

thanks. rock, can you just talk about kind of how -- obviously, you did buy back some stock during the second quarter, how you're thinking about additional share repurchase? and how the attractiveness of share repurchase compares to the investment opportunities you just talked about?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. morning, doug. i guess i'd say two things. one, obviously, capital is a precious commodity and reducing scale by repurchasing securities on the balance sheet has to be something that we're very deliberate about, given our scale. so we start with that part of the equation. having said that, i'd say secondly that as we sit here today, i don't think we're really viewing the world much differently, the markets and our stock and our circumstances versus markets much differently than we were during the second quarter.
so i'd say, generally, our orientation and our thought process would be reasonably in line with where it was while we were executing that process in the second quarter.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and can you just remind us how much authorization you have remaining on your -- under for buybacks?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
so at the end of the quarter, i think there was probably, give or take, 1 million shares left. and we've undertaken a new authorization as well, which you'll see disclosed, i think, later today or -- later today.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you, rock.
operator
and we'll take our next question from trevor cranston with jmp securities.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. you guys talked about some of the reasons why you're somewhat cautious on the agency space at the moment. but can you sort of add some color around how you weigh the fact that you think assets may be a little bit overpriced with the fed in the market versus the cost of giving up the carry income associated with relevering that book? and maybe just talk a little bit about sort of what you would be looking for to see to start adding to that portfolio again? thanks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, let's see, i think -- i don't know that i would say our thoughts are terribly outlined with maybe some others. a couple of things. one, obviously, the government is heavily involved in the net supply equation, and that's had a very powerful effect on stabilizing both sides of the agency equation, prices as well as funding.
and i think on the one hand, if one was to contemplate whether you think that bid or that influence is likely to continue to be there for a while, i think we and others would probably conclude that it probably will be around for a while. i don't think the government has probably indicated any -- given any indication that it intends to pull that support any time soon.
having said that, all of us who've been around this space know that if the government were to give any -- even a slightest hint of pulling back, that could have a negative effect on pricing. the other factor here, as i think we're all aware, is the uncertainty around speed. and so as we sit here today, let's take the low end of the coupon stack, which we'd probably find appealing at in a spec 2 at somewhere around 1.05%, but with a market expectation of maybe an 11% speed or something like that.
if it all goes according to plan, maybe you can generate a 1.25%-ish-type yield off of that, which seems like it's not, though it's reasonable. but we've also all observed that speeds, the path of speeds is -- can be pretty uncertain here recently. and so it's not outside of the room of possibility that, that could double. and if it doubles, then your yield is now probably closer to 1% or even potentially below, but it's certainly down toward 1%. and with funding and hedging associated with that, you're probably talking about cash funding that's going to be in the high teens or 20s, something like that. if you're -- depending on where you are for us, it's probably in the 20s.
and then if you're hedging half of that from a duration perspective, then you're looking at something on a blended basis, which is going to be in the 30s. and i think that tells you that, that all adds up to an roe that on an appropriately levered basis is going to be in the high single digits. and from our perspective, as we look at other alternatives, we view that we are -- we still believe we're able to generate from a selective approach to alternatives to the agency, cash carry that's going to be in the mid-single digits on an unlevered basis.
and potential upside from discounts associated with that, which gets you ideally toward double digits, but not in every case, but would likewise get you into that high single-digit category or other non-agency assets that can deliver on an unlevered basis, carry double digits without really a discount.
so, you're not likely to gain a lot of upside, but where you can generate carry on an unlevered basis that's going to be at least touching, if not more than touching the double digits. and so as we balance the equation, we're looking at agency high single digits with a significant amount of variability around speed expectations and therefore, net profitability from that asset and potential movements in capital related to that speed volatility, even as the government provides a stabilizing influence, a powerful, stabilizing influence across both sides of the key equation for agencies.
so, we balance that against the return profiles that i just illustrated in the non-agency side. and we also balance that against the securities on our own balance sheet. and i think the result is what you saw in the second quarter in which we essentially doubled the size of that alternative portfolio with those exact metrics in mind, mid-to-high single digits carry with some discount associated with it.
now, those assets have become more expensive, which is why you saw the growth in book value and the economic return at the level that we did. so that equation is a little bit less favorable today than it was two months ago, three months ago. but it still stands, and that is the equation that we are thinking about all the time. and so agency has absolutely has a place, but the other two alternatives are also have a role to play in our portfolio allocation process as well.
and sustaining a meaningful amount of liquidity and low leverage to take advantage of opportunities or dislocations as they arise is also a priority for us. so that's how we're thinking about it. that's what is the driver behind not relevering the agency portfolio, maybe up back to the levels that it historically had been or along that pathway. and i think in line with that, we view ourselves as on a very deliberate and deliberate approach of making selective asset investments in the types of asset profiles that i outlined that will occur over the coming two to three quarters or so and provide a ramp in allocation as well as a ramp in the earnings profile of the company to accompany that.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then just another question on the mortgage credit portfolio. the two new asset classes you added there, the bigger one being the msr financing and then also some of the resi mbs, looks like both of those are carried pretty close to par value. can you talk about what your expected unleveraged yield is on those new assets that you bought during the second quarter? thanks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, they're carried at fair value. and just so i'm clear on the question, trevor. you're asking about the, give or take, $75 million of incremental assets that were added from quarter-end to quarter-end. is that what you're describing?
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes, exactly.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
and you're asking what the cash carry is or the total expected return on those?
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
well, both, i guess, the sort of the yield you'll be amortizing and, i guess, what your expected total return might be?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's a blend, right? some of them are straight coupon instruments, and those are going to be in the mid-to-high single digits, call it, 6%, 6.5%, maybe some a little higher than that. and then others are going to be a combination of current and upside. and those are going to be a little bit lower currents, maybe. but with the discounts, those are going to be high single digits and some in the teens -- so i'm sorry, not teens, double-digits. but i'd say the range for those that don't have a discount upside would be 6.5%, 7% -- 6%, 6.5%, 7%, something like that. and the -- those assets that do carry discounts will be a little higher than that 7%, 8%, 9%.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, great. and then the last question, just back on the agency book. it looks like you guys have a significantly smaller hedge portfolio relative to the agency book than you have historically. can you talk about your approach to hedging right now and kind of where your interest rate sensitivity is at?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
right now, we're at 0.2 positive gaap. and that's with all the elements that i described before, it's slightly positively durated. and most of that is in the long end. that hedge is mostly in the long end. and as you can see -- you'll see it if it's not in the -- if you didn't see in the release, you'll see it in the k -- in the q. it's more of a 10-year focus.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, got it. thank you.
operator
and we'll take our next question from jason stewart with jonestrading.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. on the credit side of the investment book, what does current term financing look like? and how is that driving or impacting the opportunities that you evaluate?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, i guess first, we're not really putting financing on the credit side of the book, generally. there may be exceptions to that. but that portfolio is essentially unlevered, except for the one piece of repo on one -- on the only commercial mortgage that we have. so, we're not really focused on layering in a lot of repo financing, external financing, i should say, non-structural financing on the credit side of the portfolio. if we were, i think you'd be looking at financing rates that would be in the 300 basis point range, something like that, maybe 350 basis points on some. and depending on where they are on the credit stack, if they're really senior like a -- take a really senior rpl bond, that's going to be closer to 2%-ish.
and those that are a little bit further down the stack might be 3%, 3.5%. those are -- that would be against assets that are going to carry mid to high single digits carry. and if you're going to lever them, you'd be levering them against a 3%, 3.5% cost of funds or something like that. but we're not doing that. and i don't think we anticipate doing that soon. we don't have a need with this level of liquidity on the balance sheet.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
got it. i guess i was just thinking more down the road, if you did apply leverage what the nim would look like on it, and it sounds like it's pretty attractive.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
as a broad matter, jason, i think it'd be fair to say, if you assumed a 5% or 6% carry, something like that, it's just an example against a 3%, 3.5% net cost, that probably would be a fair assumption. we're not doing that today, but that could be possible down the road.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay. thank you, sir.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
rock, can you clarify...
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
hey chris.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, how are you doing? in your comments, and i appreciate the detailed comments you gave on the new strategy. but when you're mentioning high single-digit return for rmbs, was that unlevered?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
you mean on the credit side, on the obviously non-agencies?
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
yes.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yes? now, some of those assets, they may have some structural leverage on them. in some cases, but in many cases not. those would be unlevered, raw, either carry or a combination of carry and discount realized as upside over time.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
okay. and then i guess, i'm trying to get my hands around the strategy, given how the mbs market has evolved in the second quarter, given the decline in repo funding costs. and it seems to me just boiling it down, you're making a bet that prepayments are going to materially increase so impacting rmbs and that the u.s. economy will recover, which will enable you to keep your credit losses manageable. is that a reasonable way to look at this?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i -- possibly. meaning, prepay speeds are uncertain. and while one can fund these assets at attractive levels on a repo basis, they still have to be hedged. a 2% asset, 2% spec pool, which today would probably be the asset of choice, either a 2% or 2.5%, but let's use the 2% for now, given where rates, markets, prices and yields are, that is an asset that's going to require significant hedge. and so by placing a significant hedge on that, you're raising the cost of funding and therefore, shrinking the net spread available on that asset. and so if you get that, combined with some potential elevation in expected speeds from the number i used before, which was an 11% to say a 15%, you will realize less spread than you may believe you bargain for upfront. and it could be quite significant. so, the returns there are just less predictable than maybe they appear on the surface and maybe than they have been at points where there's been a bit wider spread opportunity.
now, others have a different view on it. and obviously, they're expressing a quite different view in their allocations. but we look at it that the combination of those uncertainties around those speeds and those net resulting spreads and the capital volatility that can occur from that, justifies an allocation that doesn't require a great deal of leverage in the agency, and at the same time, provides the opportunity to capture comparable returns. and in some cases, maybe higher returns on an unlevered or very low leverage basis on the non-agency side with liquidity, albeit less than the agency side, but some liquidity as these are cusips.
or by entering into opportunities that may not have a cusip, may not have the same liquidity, can offer double-digit returns, either in pure carry or in a combination of carry and discount upside. so, those are sort of the three sets of types of alternatives that we're looking at as well as platform opportunities that i identified in the script. but those are the opportunities that we focus on. and at the same time, we're focusing on the balance sheet -- securities on our own balance sheet as -- and balancing each of those day by day.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and also, just as a clarification, you might have mentioned it earlier. what are the -- what type of assets are you buying at a discount and hoping to collect on some discount accretion?
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
well, they're principally residential in character. they're almost exclusively residential in character. but -- so i mean they're common residential assets. we're not focused right now on the commercial side. our commercial exposure is very small. and i gave commentary in the script on the one commercial loan that we have that's performing very well and has a repo facility that extends out almost a year. so our focus is primarily residential and residential-related assets, either cusip or non-cusip. and then also, we're focused on platform opportunities that we've identified and continue to evaluate in addition to agencies.

good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to the arlington asset, second quarter 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions]. after the company's remarks, we will open the floor for questions. [operator instructions]. i would now like to turn the conference now over to richard konzmann. mr. konzmann, you may begin.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning, thank you very much. this is rich konzmann, chief financial officer of arlington asset.
before we begin this morning's call, i would like to remind everyone that statements concerning future financial or business performance, market conditions, business strategies or expectations, and any other guidance on present or future periods constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of factors, risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from the stated expectations or current circumstances.
these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which are subject to change, risk and uncertainty as a result of possible events or factors. these and other material risks are described in the company's annual report on form 10-k and other documents filed by the company with the sec from time to time, which are available from the company and from the sec and you should read and understand these risks in evaluating any forward-looking statements.
i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks.
j. rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rich. good morning and welcome to the second quarter 2020 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is brian bowers, our chief investment officer.
financial market conditions improved significantly during the second quarter, driven by unprecedented support by federal monetary and fiscal stimulus policies. despite the uncertain path of an economic recovery, risk asset prices rallied during the quarter with equity markets recovering most of their losses from the prior quarter. most fixed income asset classes also recouped some of their prior quarter losses as credit spreads generally tightened during the second quarter. and the federal reserve signaled its intention to keep short-term interest rates at their current level for the foreseeable future, leading to low interest rate volatility and a slight steepening of the yield curve during the quarter.
agency mortgage performance was mixed for the second quarter. elevated prepayment expectations adversely impacted higher coupon agency mbs, resulting in generic lower coupon bonds outperforming their higher coupon counterparts. agency mbs backed by specified pools, like those arlington owns, outperformed generic tbas as pay-up premiums for specified pools increased significantly during the quarter.
as a result of the federal reserve rate cuts and ongoing support for repo operations, repo funding for agency mbs remains readily available at lower funding costs. while the current landscape for the levered agency mbs investing has improved from last quarter, certain investment risks have also increased, including the uncertain path of prepayments in a lower interest rate environment and higher pay-up premiums embedded in the current pricing of specified pools.
with the improvement in the financial markets during the second quarter, values of most mortgage credit asset classes recovered some of their losses from the prior quarter, reflecting a general tightening of credit spreads. however, there continues to remain lack of clarity in the timing and the degree of the reopening of the economy, and its resulting financial impact on both residential and commercial mortgage borrowers.
accordingly, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of any credit losses in mortgage credit assets. despite the positive economic impact of federal monetary and fiscal policies on current market condition, the company continues to believe that the full financial ramifications from the varying degrees of shutdowns across the u.s. economy may not be appropriately priced in current investment spreads in certain fixed income assets.
as a result, the company has continued to maintain a relatively cautious stance, which prioritizes preservation and protection of the company's balance sheet through low leverage and substantial liquidity. accordingly, the company is continuing to take a selective approach to redeploying its capital or increasing leverage significantly in the current environment.
turning to the actual results for the quarter, the company reported gaap net income of $0.26 per share and non-gaap core operating income of $0.01 per share. the company's book value was $5.63 per share as of june 30th, a 7% improvement from last quarter as both its agency mbs and mortgage credit investment strategies recovered some of their losses from last quarter.
during the second quarter, the company also made accretive repurchases of its common stock, repurchasing 3% of its outstanding common stock. the company continues to maintain a low leverage profile with its short-term secured financing to investable capital ratio at 1.2:1 as of june 30th. in order to maximize its liquidity, the company did not declare a dividend on its common stock during the second quarter. the company's common stock dividend paid on february 3rd, combined with its tax loss carryforwards, provides the company with flexibility in managing its reit distribution requirements this year.
the company will evaluate future common and preferred stock dividends on a quarterly basis based upon multiple factors, including the overall economic and market conditions, return opportunities on investments, its ongoing liquidity needs and reit distribution requirements. the company was encouraged by the performance of both its agency mbs and mortgage credit portfolios during the second quarter as both positions benefited from spread tightening and attractive investments made during the quarter, while continuing to operate with overall low leverage and financial flexibility.
during the second quarter, the company increased its capital allocation to mortgage credit assets by opportunistically investing in new investments at attractive risk-adjusted returns. as of june 30th, the company's investable capital was allocated 62% to agency mbs and 38% to mortgage credit investments. although lower repo funding costs have improved current return on equity opportunities in agency mbs, pricing has become relatively expensive due to the federal reserve support through its substantial purchases of agency mbs.
within its agency mbs investment portfolio, the company decreased its allocation to higher coupon securities during the second quarter as elevated prepayment speed expectations have significantly diminished the return opportunities in this end of the coupon stack. in the agency mortgage market, the company currently sees greater return opportunities in lower coupon bonds with available levered returns in the high single digits.
notwithstanding the credit protection and liquidity associated with agency mbs, with available levered returns on a new dollar invested generally in the high single digits with appropriate leverage, we remain relatively cautious on levered agency mbs exposure. the composition of the company's current credit -- mortgage credit investments consists of a balanced portfolio of non-agency mbs collateralized primarily by residential -- commercial mortgage loans, financing collateralized by mortgage servicing rights and a commercial mortgage loan, which is performing fully in line with initial expectations.
the company is actively evaluating investment opportunities across various asset classes, including mortgage-related investments, specialized collateralized investments and other potential platform investment opportunities as they develop in this evolving investment environment.
during the second quarter, the company observed attractive return opportunities in mortgage servicing rights and financing for msrs as the values of mortgage servicing rights declined due to the elevated prepayment expectations and uncertainty surrounding servicers' ability to meet servicing advances associated with anticipated borrower default and forbearances, which then led to spreads on the financing of msr assets widening meaningfully.
msr financing investments typically consist of term senior notes securitized by mortgage servicing rights that also carry a corporate parent guarantee. the company took advantage of attractive risk-adjusted returns available in msr financing opportunities with significant collateral protection by making several new investments in this asset class during the quarter.
as of june 30th, the company held $64 million of msr financing investments. and the company is continuing to evaluate additional attractive investment opportunities related to mortgage servicing rights either through direct investments in msrs or financings collateralized by msrs. the company does not currently have significant repo funding exposure in its mortgage credit investment portfolio. as of june 30th, the company did not have any outstanding repo funding on any of its non-agency mbs or msr financing investments.
the company's sole funding exposure on its mortgage credit investment portfolio consists of $32 million of repo funding for a commercial mortgage loan with strong credit statistics, with a repo funding maturity in may '21 that has had no margin calls to date. while the dislocations in the financial markets from the covid-19-induced economic shutdowns have laid the foundation for attractive investment opportunities in certain mortgage-related and other credit assets, the company believes certain credit assets may not yet have fully priced in the effects of the economic outlook.
we are executing on a plan of a selective approach that focuses on current investments, which provide acceptable returns on capital and will enable the company to deliver a positive economic return to shareholders over time, while retaining sufficient liquidity that will provide the company with ongoing ability to capture attractive investment opportunities that may arise across sectors as economic conditions evolve over the coming quarters.
in summary, the company's high level of liquidity and low leverage ensures the company is well positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that may be created as the full economic impact of the current economic downturn materialize and should enable the company to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders over time.
we'd be happy to take questions, if you have them.

thank you. at this time, we will open the floor for questions. [operator instructions] our first question will come from doug harter with credit suisse.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, guys. this is josh, on for doug.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, rock. how are you doing? we saw the buyback activity during the quarter, i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the attractiveness of buyback versus paying out a dividend? and then when we think about the expense base for the company, can expense reduction keep up with an accelerated share buyback or how should we think about expenses as a percentage of equity going forwards? thanks.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, josh. so i think, with the stock in the neighborhood of recent prices, it seems pretty clear to us that buyback is a more compelling opportunity than dividending at this stage, particularly given that we don't have a distribution requirement for the remainder of the year. so, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it seems to us that the better path is the repurchase versus the dividend. and that's why you've seen ongoing stream of repurchases over the last couple of quarters. and we have the benefit of, as i've said, a stable financial position with strong liquidity and flexibility in the balance sheet to be able to do that.
as to the expense base, i'd say, look, there are some constraints there and how fast the expense line can come down, but we've made good progress in reducing the expense line. and i think that there is room for more of that to occur in the next year -- over the course of this year and in the next year and through next year. so i think that there are further opportunities for reductions on the cost side. whether those keep up, or don't exactly keep up with the pace of buybacks, will be dependent on what the market does with the stock.
and so at the pace that we've been on, i think expense reductions can reasonably keep pace with that sort of type activity, but to the extent there is an acceleration there that may be more challenging except over the longer term. but i do see the possibility of further expense reductions over the next 12 months. that will be helpful in reducing the burden on the capital and improving returns to shareholders by so doing.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. makes sense. and then any update on how book value is trending so far in the fourth quarter? thank you.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say so far book value is up by a point or two. we've had a couple of spots of good performance in the portfolio and some other factors that have been helpful in pushing the book value up somewhat during the course of october.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks, rock.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from jason stewart with jones trading.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jason.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
hi. good morning, rock. thanks for the question. on the agency side, i was wondering if you could give a little bit of commentary with regards to the origination environment. how you think that plays out with regard to spec pool pay ups, as we go through this seasonally slow period of time?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks. i'd say, we continue to be pretty significantly invested on the spec pool side for a pretty obvious reasons, the protection from the prepayment speeds, which have been volatile and i don't think we really expect them to -- the pattern of them to change materially. we would expect them to remain relatively high and a bit uncertain. so on the one hand we like the protection offered by the spec pools, but at the margin they have gotten to be quite expensive, and so i wouldn't be surprised if you see us be a little bit more active on the role in the fourth quarter, they -- may be than we were proportionately in the third quarter. and so i think it wouldn't surprise me, if between now and the end of the quarter, depending on how our role plays out for the rest of the year, if we were to be in the end more active on the roll side, proportionately, the portfolio and may be at the margin de-emphasize the spec side just a touch here in these conditions.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thank you. and on the credit portfolio, how much does hpa play into the thesis on the credit side?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
we're really not relying on the hpa side, terribly notch, i'd say -- if it has any involvement in that equation, it's modest. we feel like the credit investments we've made to-date stand on their own 2 feet based on where hpa -- where housing prices are today, to the extent we continue to see some appreciation grade. we'll get more protection in those assets to the extent that we're reviewing other real estate opportunities.
as i mentioned in the script, then that hpa factor will come a bit more into play. so for example, we have spent a lot of time over the last months taking a hard look at single-family rentals. that segment seems to have some compelling characteristics to it, both from a carry return, but also a total return characteristic including hpa to your point. and so, in that calculation we would expect there to be either very little or modest depreciation that really isn't the driver for our investment thesis in the single-family rental, if we were to enter that space.
but we do feel like those returns have become more compelling. i mean, we're not alone, i don't think. but we feel like those returns have become more compelling relative to some other alternatives as spreads have tightened on qsub securities and rates have remained very low. so absolute returns are more modest and therefore i think single family rental and msrs for that matter stand out as having sort of out distance return potential in this environment.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
right. i'll jump out after this last question. on the msr side have you -- can you share any details on how you think about recaptures when you enter these agreements on the msr side. with rates where they are, it seems to be that's one of the driving forces of returns is how much you can negotiate on the recapture side?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
it's a very important aspect of it and to the extent that as i said in the script, we've made progress on a potential partnership in that regard and that partner -- we'd be working very closely with that partner to maximize the recapture on that portfolio.
jason stewart -- jones trading -- analyst
okay. thank you for the questions. appreciate it.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thank you, jason.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, guys. rock, is the...
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
hi, chris.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
fourth quarter to-date is the investment mix in terms of capital allocation sort of staying weighted toward the agency investments?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say in the fourth quarter so far it's probably not much different than when we stated in the script. i think in the script, we said it was about two-thirds, one-third, and i'd say it's not terribly different at this stage versus that stage.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess the lower cprs in the quarter, is that simply just a function of going to lower coupon agency rmbs?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. exactly.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. and then, i noticed that the debt amount have, the traditional metrics you guys provide like net interest margin, funding cost and all that stuff. so in the future times, if you guys can consider putting those back, that'd be great.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and a lot of those will be in the 10-q as well.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
understood. but it's helpful before the call to have that stuff handy. final question, rock, just a clarification on outlook for a leverage. it seems to me that you're indicating that you're going to keep the leverage levels, relatively low, below 2 times, but did i hear you correctly, or do i misinterpret that?
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't -- i think generally you heard me correctly. i don't put a particular hard number on it, chris. but i think just as we saw slight migration from the third -- from the second quarter to third quarter, we may see a slight migration. but generally, as i've said repeatedly through the script, from our perspective, paramount to maintain a low leverage and high financial flexibility in the balance sheet and we will continue to seek to do that. so i think that means there may be some modest expansion in leverage, but i don't expect it to be substantial.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
all right. okay. that's it from me. thank you.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
and to the point i made in the script, we're seeking to use structural leverage where possible versus repo leverage and so we would first be -- if we were increasing leverage, it would first be done through that feature versus repo, if that were at all achievable.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
yeah. no. i think that echoes what you've said in the past quarters for this current strategy on the mortgage credits.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst

good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to the arlington asset third quarter 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions] after the company's remarks, we will open the floor for questions. [operator instructions]
i would like to now turn the conference now over to richard konzmann. mr. konzmann, you may begin.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you very much and good morning. this is rich konzmann, chief financial officer of arlington asset. before we begin this morning's call, i would like to remind everyone that statements concerning future financial or business performance, market conditions, business strategies or expectations, and any other guidance on present or future periods constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number [phonetic] of factors, risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations or current circumstances.
these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which are subject to change, risk and uncertainty as a result of possible events or factors. these and other material risks are described in the company's annual report on form 10-k and other documents filed by the company with the sec from time to time, which are available from the company and from the sec and you should read and understand these risks when evaluating any forward-looking statement.
i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks.
rock tonkel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rich. good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is john murray, our portfolio manager. continued federal monetary and fiscal support contributed to improved economic conditions and a risk on investor's sentiment during the quarter. risk asset prices rallied with the equity markets continuing to strengthen and credit spreads on most fixed income asset classes tightening against the backdrop of muted interest rate volatility during the quarter.
with low interest rate volatility and ongoing federal reserve balance sheet support, agency mortgages performed well during the third quarter. with repo funding for agency mbs readily available at attractive funding costs, investing in levered agency mbs continues to be an appealing investment opportunity for the company. however, certain investment risks continue to exist, including the uncertain path of prepayments in the low rate environment, and higher pay of premiums embedded in the current pricing of specified pools.
along with most fixed income products, mortgage credit asset values generally increased during the third quarter reflecting overall tightening of credit spreads with the improved economic outlook. supported by favorable housing supply dynamics, low mortgage rates and stabilization of delinquencies, residential mortgage credit asset prices strengthened during the quarter. commercial mortgage credit performance was mixed during the quarter as the economic impact of the pandemic has more adversely impacted certain commercial asset classes than others.
in the current environment, the company's focus is to grow earnings in the near-term and raise overall returns to shareholders over time through investments in agency mbs, credit, and other financial asset classes which offer attractive returns today. in addition to securing multiple income sources which diversify risk and improve the level and reliability of returns, the company seeks to maintain a stable financial position by keeping leverage low and financial flexibility high, while using term non-margin financing structures were available to protect against higher interest rates and simultaneously permit underlying asset values to rise with lower rates.
such a posture provides the company flexibility through volatile periods and the ability to be opportunistic and nimble in approaching potential investments. further, the company is focused on creating asset partnerships or platforms, where possible to promote predictability of investment flows, growth and compounding value creation opportunities that layer on top of the current income returns embedded in the company's investments generally.
during the third quarter, agency mbs and certain mortgage credit sector satisfied each of the company's portfolio objectives. however, as expected, future returns on some mortgage credit segments within the company's portfolio have tightened as a result of appreciation. the company is evaluating investment opportunities in msr-related investments as well as real estate opportunities and other financial asset types, which may meet the company's objectives for low leverage, robust returns, diversification of risk as well as attractive financing structures.
turning to the actual results for the quarter, the company reported gaap net income of $0.12 per share and non-gaap core operating income of $0.03 per share. the company's book value was $5.92 per share, as of september 30, a 5.2% improvement from last quarter as both its agency mbs and mortgage credit investment strategies experienced positive performance. the company maintained a low leverage profile with net repo financing to investable capital ratio at 1.5 to 1, as of september 30, and returned capital to shareholders through accretive stock repurchases during the third quarter at significant discounts to book value.
during the third quarter, the company repurchased 5.8% of its outstanding common stock at an average repurchase price of $2.80 per share. the company will evaluate future common stock dividends on a quarterly basis based on multiple factors, including opportunities to return capital to shareholders through accretive stock repurchases, overall economic and market conditions, available returns on new investments, ongoing liquidity needs and reit distribution requirements. the company does not expect to have any further reit distribution requirements for 2020.
the company was encouraged by the performance of both its agency mbs and the mortgage credit investment portfolios during the third quarter, as both positions benefited from spread tightening and attractive investments made during the quarter, while continuing to operate with overall low leverage and financial flexibility. as of september 30, the company's investable capital was allocated 69% to its agency mortgage strategy and 31% to mortgage credit investments. although, lower repo funding costs have benefited returns and levered agency mbs investments, bond prices continue to be relatively expensive due to the federal reserve's ongoing support through its substantial purchases of agency mbs.
within its agency mbs investment portfolio, the company continues to decrease its allocation to higher coupon securities during the third quarter, and as elevated prepayment speed expectations have significantly diminished the return opportunities in this end of the coupon stack. the company currently sees greater return opportunities in the lower coupon agency mortgages with available levered returns in the high-single digits.
the company's mortgage credit investments currently consists of a diversified portfolio of financings, collateral -- collateralized by mortgage servicing rights, business purpose residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans. here the company is actively pursuing investment opportunities across various asset classes that it believes will generate high risk adjusted returns with the potential for greater value creation for shareholders overtime. the company continues to see attractive return opportunities in the mortgage servicing rights sector.
current purchase price multiples for mortgage servicing rights are attractive as the company believes the future performance of msrs will exceed the implied prepayment expectations and the anticipated service or advance requirements embedded in current msr values, while also offering appreciation potential, associated with any further retracement back toward pre-covid msr multiple levels.
although credit spreads on financing and mortgage servicing rights tightened during the third quarter along with other fixed-income assets, the company continues to see opportunities in msr financing investments as well. however, in the msr asset class, the company sees higher risk adjusted returns by investing directly in mortgage servicing rights and the company made progress during the quarter toward a partnership that could lead to direct economic investments in msrs with positive implications for returns on msr investments and overall company returns going forward.
during the quarter, business purpose residential loans offered particularly attractive risk-adjusted returns. business purpose residential mortgage loans are low ltv loans to professional real estate investors that are secured by a first-lien position on non-owner occupied residential real estate that generally requires construction, repair or rehabilitation. during the third quarter, the company added to its business purpose loan portfolio with a first loss piece of a newly issued securitization for $11 million with an expected loss adjusted return on capital in the mid-teens.
as a result of the company's loss mitigation rights on the underlying loan collateral and option to purchase any significant -- any delinquent loans from the trust, the company consolidates for financial reporting purposes, the underlying mortgage loan collateral and term notes issued by the trust. however, the term notes issued by the trust have recourse only to the loan collateral of the trust with no economic recourse to the company.
the company does not currently have significant repo funding exposure in its mortgage credit investment portfolio, as of september 30, the company did not have outstanding repo funding on any of its non-agency mbs or msr financing investments. the company's sole funding exposure on its mortgage credit investment portfolio consists of a $32 million repo funding or a commercial mortgage loan with strong credit statistics that has performed better than expected at origination, as a repo funding maturity in august of '21 and has had no margin cost to date.
going forward, the company will continue to limit its use of margin of repo funding for mortgage credit investments, instead, the company will focus on financing mortgage credit investments either directly or indirectly, through long term and non-marginal financing structures. the company has made solid progress toward establishing a portfolio, comprised of multiple financial asset channels to provide diversification of risk and multiple income sources to raise overall returns to shareholders. we expect to maintain a strong financial position highlighted by low leverage, high financial flexibility and the use of term financing structures where possible.
in addition to its existing agency mbs and mortgage credit strategy, the company continues to evaluate additional mortgage credit, real estate and other investment opportunities with a focus on developing investment platforms and strategic partners where possible that will result in longer-term enterprise value creation and provide a compounding opportunity that complements the current income embedded in the bulk of the company's investments. this should enable the company to deliver a positive economic return to shareholders in the near-term, while retaining sufficient liquidity to be opportunistic and capture attractive investment opportunities that may arise across sectors as economic conditions evolve over coming quarters.
operator, i would now like to open the call for questions.
",2020-Q3,AAIC
,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from trevor cranston with jmp securities.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi. thanks. a couple of questions on the msr investments. i guess, first, as you think about deploying more capital into that asset class and the sort of benefits it has relative to an agency portfolio, i mean, how are you guys thinking about sort of a target for capital allocation? and how much of your capital you could potentially allocate toward msrs over the course of the year?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, trevor. so today, with $67 million of capital invested there, we have not yet utilized the financing facilities that are available to us. and those financing facilities enable us to borrow not quite, but almost on a one-to-one basis. i don't think we envision that we would lever that significantly. but i think we could see our way to using something along the lines of half of that leverage amount, which on the existing capital allocation would take us up to the neighborhood of not quite $100 million of total value invested in msrs.
so in the near term, that sort of feels like our horizon, our natural horizon. depending on markets, multiples, primary rate and other factors, we would consider going beyond that, but our near-term horizon is probably somewhere between here and $100 million of total investment, which would mean a modest, if any, incremental allocation of capital now. that may change over time, but in the reasonable near-term time frame, that's sort of how we think about it.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got it. and then in terms of the asset yield on msrs, the number you reported on slide 10 is pretty attractive relative to a lot of other fixed income assets in the market right now. i was curious is that nine-plus percent yield, is that something that particularly benefited from buying low coupons prior to the big increase in mortgage rates? and i was also curious if you could just comment on where you would expect economic yields on new msr purchases today to be?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so as you saw last quarter, we had initiated the partnership, during the course of the fourth quarter, i think probably in the latter part of the fourth quarter. and we had layered in, at that time, $10 million or $15 million or something like that of msrs. we added another significant amount early in the first quarter. so we sort of got the benefit of investing in those at lower multiples, say, in the neighborhood of -- three-ish, maybe a little below, a little above, between those two baskets. a little bit below or a little above 3. and so we benefited during the quarter for multiple expansion, as i said in the script.
and to your question, yields were naturally higher there because of the lower multiple that we were paying on those msrs.
today, as i said, sort of -- i alluded to in the script, we look at multiples in the neighborhood of four. and at that level, you're probably closer to something like an eight. maybe an eight and change, something like that would be a reasonable level on a bulk purchase and maybe a little higher on a flow. we would expect to be involved a little bit more going forward than we have been to date in the flow market, where those -- even at these multiples look like they're closer to nine. and so we feel like that eight to nine range today, depending on bulk or flow is probably a fair range for unlevered yield in those assets newly placed in the portfolio from here forward.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got it. and then in terms of your interest rate positioning of the balance sheet in the portfolio, looking at slide nine, it seems like you have a fairly large amount of long-duration swaps relative to the agency book. and then in addition, you obviously have the msrs and have continued to add to those.
can you say what kind of -- what's your overall net duration is? or your exposure to kind of changes in the long end of the yield curve? and also maybe comment on whether or not you've made any changes to the swap book in the second quarter as you continue to find more msrs.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
yes. great question, trevor. great question. well placed. the -- at that time, we had not yet closed on a block of msrs that we've been able to put in place in april. and so no surprise to your question, that's provided an opportunity to sort of shift our footprint a bit from a duration perspective. so you see in the charts there that we had a bit of a negative duration bias, a negative duration bias at that time. and that's left now. that's closer to flat. i'd say still slightly negative, but meaningfully less negative duration than was the case at that time, but still between 0 and one. also keep in mind that at the time you see those charts, neighborhood of $200 million of those were short swaps, two to three years.
and so that's worth keeping in mind. and then the last thing is we've actually scaled the agency balance up a bit more since quarter end with the benefit of that msr block in place that closed in april. so we've got a bit larger agency book. we've obviously got a larger msr footprint than we did at quarter end. and the net duration of that -- the net duration effect of all of that in combination with some modest shifts on the hedging side leaves us to a less negative duration more between 0 and one today than was the case then.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and trevor, this is rich. if you didn't see on slide 19, we have the calculation at quarter end, our duration gap and the interest rate sensitivity, the rate shock sensitivity to the portfolio as well.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. i had actually missed that. so thanks for pointing that out.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
so trevor, was that clear, trevor? does that clarify it? or is there more that would be helpful there?
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
no, that did answer the question. great. appreciated the comment. thank you, guys.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer

we'll take our next question from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
rock, in the second quarter, have you guys increased your capital allocation at all to mortgage credits?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
slightly. i think we have begun to see more interesting opportunities, chris, in mortgage credit in the second quarter, sort of very late in the first quarter, into the second quarter. so we've added a bit to that portfolio since the end of the quarter, and we are looking more closely at those as net roes have edged back up into the double digits from their types, which would have been high single digits. some returns on equity and credit even got to the point where they were not that far above five.
and that has now loosened up and given us some new opportunities. we were selling into those types. as you saw our balances come down in the first quarter. second quarter, we've actually been able to move that up a little bit. and without predicting that we will, it wouldn't surprise me if we were able to add some incremental volume there to the mortgage credit portfolio in the quarter, given the improvement in roes into the double digits.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and as you look at the second half of the year, where, conceptually, are you thinking you would like the capital allocation division to look like from where it is now?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's a good question. it will depend on relative risk-adjusted return opportunities. so as we've said now for a couple of quarters, we have been evaluating a number of opportunities across mortgage-related and some nonmortgage-related asset classes. we've made some progress there. i think i may have alluded in the last quarter, we were close on another one that in the end didn't work out, but we have several other initiatives that we are in process of that we're making solid progress on. we'd be hopeful that we'll have positive things to say about them this -- during the course of this quarter -- at our next quarter release. but we certainly can't guarantee that, but we are encouraged by progress in those things.
i think it'll -- that capital allocation mix will be a byproduct of the progress that we make in some of these alternative higher return risk diversifying asset opportunities that we are investigating now. for now, to my answer to trevor's question earlier, i think you'll see us incrementally dial up the capital allocation to msrs. i don't expect that, that -- in this particular quarter would be a really enormously substantial move up in the allocation to msrs relative to agencies because we would most likely use some leverage in that portfolio as our first lever.
but that will depend on where multiples are and waccs on msrs versus levered returns in agency. to the extent that some of these others develop then in the quarter, the course of the second and the third quarter, through the year, then we'd expect to see that allocation rise above a total of 25%, which was where it was at the end of the quarter to non-agency mbs capital. so moving agency capital probably in that case, closer to 50% from the 75% today and in the process, raising returns and lowering leverage.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
my final question is for the mortgages underlying your msrs, do you seek out a particular profile of the loan or borrower? and if so, what is that, please?
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
well, you can see from what i said in the script with a 2.96% wacc, we're trying to be quite focused. we're trying to be quite focused on keeping the lid on the wacc and protecting against prepayment speed escalation as best we can in that process. we're probably sitting here today at a little -- in the neighborhood of 50 basis points, i think, above our lows, our historic lows in the primary rate. and we feel like a 2.96% wacc, we're reasonably well protected. and we'll continue to try to focus on keeping those waccs low in our ongoing msr flow and bulk transactions. in the meantime, we're very, very focused on the nature of the originator.
the pattern of their prepayment experience across their assets, which we're also able to follow through our agency mortgage investing. so we're familiar with these originators, pretty intimately familiar with them, and we can -- we're aligning our msr purchase investments with our knowledge from the agency side from a prepayment perspective, and we're very focused on the recapture capability of these of these originators and servicers to recapture the prepays. so that's our focus. we've had some success here initially. we feel like we'll continue to try to keep the discipline that we've begun as we've entered into this partnership and begun to scale it to some level of critical size relative to our total capital mix.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from josh bolton with credit suisse.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. thanks. rock, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the share repurchase authorization that you guys have. curious how you're thinking about the trade-off between deploying capital into one of your target assets versus the returns you would get by repurchasing shares? thanks.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so naturally, josh -- good question, naturally, one that we're focused on every single day, as we evaluate alternatives. i think you know what the variables are, i think, pretty well in that, it is the magnitude of return on our opportunities versus the accretion that we can generate from repurchasing the stock, which is, on the one hand, substantial. but on the other hand, repurchasing the stock and reducing the capital base does have other effects, as you know, so that's an ongoing calculation.
you've seen us be quite aggressive in the past both corporately and personally, as folks saw in addition to buying back a healthy chunk of the stock last year at attractive prices and doing it accretively. i doubled my own personal stake in the company and other management members have as well. so we continue to view the stock as very positively from an investment perspective and our dynamic process for evaluating returns against that sets up in a context where we're also judging it against market volatility in the first quarter.
we did buy stock, not as much as we had in prior periods, and part of the reason for that was the level of volatility in markets as well as the very compelling nature of the quite exceptional return opportunity we felt we were facing in msrs in particular. we're -- we continue to evaluate that all the time. we view the stock as very attractive today from an investment and repurchase perspective. and when our windows open up, you could assume that we will be very closely assessing that question on a day-by-day basis.
josh bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for [indecipherable].
operator
we'll take our next question from jason stewart with jones trading.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
[indecipherable]. thank you. rock, i was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on your comment about non-mortgage, non-real estate opportunities. if it's -- how close we are to that? and sort of what realm of parameters you're looking at there? thanks.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
so a good question, jason. i think we've alluded to this in the past that within the company, we have a range of intellectual property and expertise based on our collective many decades in financial asset classes, particularly related to housing and other credit but also in other areas. and so we evaluate those opportunistically on the basis of their sort of proprietary nature and their -- and our ability to create a sort of partnership or sort of strategic-type relationship there where we can generate not only a solid flow of high-return asset opportunities, but also compounding opportunity and value creation through upside, compounding through upside value and appreciation.
and so those are part of the metrics. i'd say we're making good progress on some of those. we don't have anything further to say about it right at the moment. but we're hopeful that during the second quarter, we may have the ability to speak more about that sometime between now and our next release or at our next release.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay. thanks, appreciated all [indecipherable] questions were already tackled. thank you.

mr. tonkel, there are no more questions at this time.

good morning. i'd like to welcome everyone to the arlington asset first quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to rich konzmann.
mr. konzmann, you may begin.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you very much, and good morning. this is rich konzmann, chief financial officer of arlington asset. before we begin this morning's call, i would like to remind everyone that statements concerning future financial or business performance, market conditions, business strategies or expectations, and any other guidance on present or future periods, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of factors, risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially from stated expectations or current circumstances.
these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations, which are subject to change, risk and uncertainty as a result of possible events or factors. these and other material risks are described in the company's annual report on form 10-k and other documents filed by the company with the sec from time to time, which are available from the company and from the sec, and you should read and understand these risks when evaluating any forward-looking statements.
i would now like to turn the call over to rock tonkel for his remarks.
j. rock tonkel, jr. -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rich. good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining us on the call today is john murray, our portfolio manager. during the first quarter, risk assets continue to rise amid a progressing global economic recovery, supported by government monetary and fiscal stimulus policies, broader vaccine rollout efforts and growing expectations of a full economic reopening. with the increased positive outlook, the overriding long-term economic theme for the quarter was inflation risk. in response, the long-term interest rates rapidly rose with the 10-year u.s.
treasury rate increasing over 80 basis points during the first quarter, leading to a significant steepening of the yield curve as short interest rates remain anchored at historical low levels. the short rise -- the sharp rise in the long end of the treasury curve led to an extension of mortgage durations, particularly lower coupon agency mbs. performance of mortgage servicing rights was strong during the first quarter as prepayment speed expectations declined with the rise of mortgage rates. residential mortgage credit spreads were relatively flat during the quarter, while home price appreciation continued its strong annual growth.
the company's long-term investment strategy is to construct an investment portfolio with multiple sources of income, which complement our agency mbs portfolio, diversify risk and improve the level and reliability of returns. over time, the company expects to complement its allocation of capital and agency mortgages by deploying portions of its liquidity, currently in the form of unencumbered agency mbs into its other targeted investment strategies, including mortgage servicing rights, mortgage credit, and other asset classes. we expect to maintain a strong, stable and liquid financial position by keeping leverage low and financial flexibility high, while utilizing term non-margin financing structures where available.
in addition, the company is focused on creating partnerships or platforms where possible, to promote the predictability of investment flows, growth and the potential for compounding value creation opportunities that layer on top of the current investment returns embedded in the company's investments. during the first quarter, the company made solid progress toward these goals by reallocating capital into msr-related investments. as of march 31, the company's investable capital was allocated 75% to its agency mortgage strategy, 12% to mortgage servicing rights and 13% to mortgage credit. newly created mortgage servicing rights of fannie mae and freddie mac loans currently offer attractive return opportunities.
at purchase price multiples of just above four times, unlevered msr investments offer comparable base returns to levered agency mbs with potential upside from multiple expansion, positive correlation to duration extension, no mark-to-market financing risk and no exposure to matched hedge funding risk. significant barriers to entry exist for investing in mortgage servicing rights as an investor is required to hold specific licenses to purchase or hold msrs directly. to invest in msrs through traditional means, an investor would typically need to establish or acquire a licensed residential mortgage servicer, which requires a significant amount of time and capital to complete as well as subjects the investor to ongoing operational and regulatory oversight and risk.
on our prior earnings call, we highlighted that the company has established a strategic relationship with a licensed gse-approved servicer that enables the company to garner the economic return of an investment in mortgage servicing rights without holding the requisite license directly. under the terms of our partnership, the company provides capital to our partner to purchase msrs directly. and the company, in turn, receives all the economics of the msrs, less a fee payable to our partner. we believe this efficient, cost-effective and lower risk channel for investing in the economics of mortgage servicing rights differentiates arlington.
to date, our economic thesis for allocating capital to mortgage servicing rights has produced positive results as our msr-related asset investment portfolio generated outsized returns above expectations during the first quarter. msr cash flows performed as expected, and the portfolio experienced significant multiple expansion from approximately three times to modestly above four times. the company has not utilized any leverage on its msr investment portfolio to date, but at our option and direction, our partner has the capacity to add leverage to increase potential returns. the company's msr investment portfolio grew to $36 million or 12% of investable capital as of quarter end.
and subsequent to march 31, we have invested an additional $31 million in msr-related assets, increasing our investable capital allocation to over 20% today, representing approximately $6.4 billion of unpaid principal balance. turning to levered agency mbs. returns there continue to benefit from low repo funding costs, ongoing federal reserve support and steepening yield curve. although the rise in long-term interest rates and extension of mortgage duration have increased hedging costs during the quarter. against this backdrop, we are currently seeing available returns in the high single digits in levered agency mbs with an appropriate hedge position.
however, if the economy continues to demonstrate improvement and inflation concerns continue to escalate, market expectation that the federal reserve may taper its holdings of agency mortgage could lead to a widening of agency mortgage spreads. with mortgage spreads currently at multiyear tight, the company remains cautious about significantly increasing the leverage on its allocated agency mortgage capital. taken in combination, complementing the levered agency portfolio with msrs decreases overall risk while increasing roes. msrs tend to increase in value as mortgage rates rise and more specifically when durations on agency mbs extend.
this increase in value resulting from mortgage extension typically occurs when mismatches between levered agency mbs and hedges are highest. furthermore, msrs are a positive carry hedge for levered agency securities, replacing negative carry swaps with positive carry msrs, turns the largest drag unlevered agency mbs returns in the current environment into a carry positive. more specifically, for every $10 million in msrs we aggregate, we can invest approximately $5 million of capital in leveraged agency securities without the need for a long-dated hedge.
said another way, set against the backdrop of our agency mbs portfolio balance of approximately $615 million at march 31, the msr portfolio we now hold with unpaid principal balance of $6.4 billion, $67 million of capital invested and a wacc of 2.96%, would have eliminated the need for approximately $120 million of long-dated hedges at that time, which would have added approximately 200 to 400 basis points of roe to fully levered agency mbs returns, boosting them into the double digits from the high single digits and improving the overall risk profile in that portfolio combined.
in the current environment, the company expects to maintain a substantial capital allocation to agency mbs, while evaluating opportunities to redeploy the liquidity it holds primarily in the form of unencumbered agency mbs and into other investments in its targeted strategies over time that complement agency mbs, while offering better risk-adjusted returns and requiring lower at-risk leverage. the company is presently focused, in particular, on continuing to invest in msr-related assets as well as mortgage credit opportunities, which offer risk-adjusted returns in excess of agency mbs, while also closely evaluating opportunities in other financial asset classes, including those that may not be mortgage or real estate-related that meets the company's objectives for low leverage, strong returns, diversification of risk and term or non-marginable financing structures.
for the first quarter, arlington's agency mortgage investment portfolio with a concentration in lower coupon securities underperformed as asset prices declined due to increased rate volatility and asset duration extending in response to the sharp rise in long-term interest rates. the company was net long duration and its combined agency mbs and hedge portfolio at year-end, while the msr portfolio was not yet able to be scaled at the beginning of the year to fully offset agency mbs price decline. the company added significantly to its hedge and msr positions as interest rates first began their rise, which served to mitigate the asset price declines experienced during the quarter. the underperformance of the company's agency mbs and hedge portfolio during the first quarter was partially offset by a very strong performance in the company's msr-related assets as well as its mortgage credit investments due to strengthening credit metrics in that portfolio.
these combined investment portfolio performance results led the company to report book value of $6.12 per share as of march 31, a decline of three% from the prior quarter end. as of march -- as of april 30, the company's book value per share increased approximately one% since quarter end. the company continue to operate with low leverage and significant financial flexibility with its overall at-risk leverage ratio standing at 1.4:1 as of march 31, a decline of one turn from year-end. for the first quarter, the company reported a gaap net loss of $0.20 per share and core operating income of $0.03 per share. as we highlighted during our prior quarter earnings call, despite the strong credit performance of a consolidated trust of residential business purpose loans, we anticipated its contribution to our first quarter core operating income would decline due to the short duration and accelerated paydown of that investment.
although its contribution to core operating income was lower this quarter, the company's investment in this consolidated trust experienced a particularly strong economic return of 9% for the first quarter as its credit performance continue to exceed our initial expectations. the company did not declare a dividend on its common stock for the first quarter. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock based on multiple factors, which -- including current earnings results, overall market conditions, liquidity needs, return opportunities on investments and reit distribution requirements.
with regard to its reit requirements, the company does have the flexibility to utilize its tax loss carryforwards to reduce its taxable income and annual distribution requirements. the company will also look to continue to return capital to shareholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of its common stock at accretive prices. the company continues to have a large remaining authorization from its board to repurchase shares of its common stock. overall, the company is very encouraged by the solid progress it has made to date in a transition toward its long-term goals and is optimistic about its prospects going forward. the company took positive steps during the first quarter toward its objective of complementing its agency mbs portfolio with high-return non-commodity investment channels, which provide diversification of risk, multiple income sources to raise overall returns to shareholders and offer sustainable ongoing investment flow.
in addition to its existing mbs, msr and mortgage credit strategies, the company continues to evaluate opportunities in other attractive financial asset classes with a focus on developing investment platforms and strategic partnerships that could potentially result in long-term enterprise value creation. as the company deploys available capital to msrs and our diversified investments made through non-commodity channels, we expect higher returns from these investments to provide expanded earnings power over time, which can form the potential pathway for returning capital to shareholders.
as that deployment process occurs, we expect to maintain a strong financial position, highlighted by low leverage, high financial flexibility and the use of term financing structures where possible, enabling the company to be opportunistic and capture attractive investment opportunities that may arise across sectors as economic conditions evolve as well as the ongoing ability to utilize its sizable stock repurchase authority.
operator, i would now like to open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from trevor cranston with jmp securities.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey.
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning trevor.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
i guess, first question, a little bit bigger picture. with the progress you guys have made, building up the portfolio, improving the core earnings. can you share your thoughts on how youre thinking about potentially reinstating a dividend? i guess, i mean, im aware you guys have also been buying back shares. but just curious to get your thoughts on how youre thinking about the prospects of paying a dividend? thanks.
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. sure. so we are encouraged. by the ramp in earnings and capital deployment thats providing that ramp in earnings. we have made meaningful progress, not only in the msr side, but were hopeful that we have additional opportunities to discuss, as i referred to in the script here over the course of the coming quarter. and i think that leaves us with a positive picture and expectation over the course of the rest of the year. and i think that -- and thats something well be talking more about over the course of the remainder of the year. so i think the basis, the improved basis in earnings and capital allocation, combined with the additional partnerships that we hope to have in place here over the not-too-distant term. certainly in the coming quarter will provide us with additional ramp to deployment in earnings and set the basis for further conversation about that over the course of the rest of the year.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. got it. thats helpful and then a couple of questions on the msr assets. i guess, first, i was curious what you guys thoughts are on the continued rally in rates, which has happened in july and what the risk is of a significant pickup in prepay speeds on the msr assets, particularly if we were to get 30-year mortgage rates to drift back down meaningfully below that 2.94% note rate on the msrs.
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i think, trevor, certainly, thats something we think about daily. and were adjusting our -- our combination of agencies and our agency durations against that possibility every day. we would expect positive performance up rate from the msr portfolio, both in terms of value and in terms of cash flows, and we would expect the agency duration from a lower coupon portfolio emphasis on the agency side to provide the down rate support in value. and what weve seen is that a couple of things. one, the primary rate has been a bit more resilient to the -- and remained and not fallen as much as the underlying rate curve we also have had a reasonable, if not more than reasonable recapture experience, and we expect that to improve over time, given the tenure of this relationship as it expands and as it goes on in time, we expect that recapture capability to improve. and we really need for the prime rate. one would need for the prime rate to really translate back to the low 2s to create a significant change in the income and value characteristics of that msr book. thus far, as you, im sure, know, msrs have remained fairly resilient, both in terms of their cash flows and in terms of their multiples to the rate fall, and thats partly explained by the fact that the primary rate has been a bit more resilient and has not fallen in lockstep with the rate curve.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. okay. that makes sense. and i guess last thing, do you guys have a book value update you can give on the quarter-to-date performance?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. id say were about flat.
trevor cranston -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason stewart with jonestrading.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
hey. thanks for the taking the question and good morning. rock, i wanted to go back to the stock repurchase. i mean, obviously, with the stock where it is, its super accretive to book value, but theres got to be some limitation in your mind in terms of how much capital you can return via stock repurchases. any update you can give us there?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, what i can say, jason, is what you probably expect. one, the level and amount of buyback that were conducting is directly related naturally to the combination of other investment alternatives and the scale of the organization overall. i would say -- you also, im sure, know that we have a very significant sized buyback authorization in place. so we have great flexibility in that regard. and so i think you should expect to see us continue to be vigilant in repurchasing the stock, whether that means that its more at a faster pace and larger amounts or a slower pace and lesser amounts than we have been is completely dependent on those variables, the price level, the stock, the alternative investments and the overall scale of the organization, having added a little bit of additional capital to the investable capital of the firm over the course of the last quarter. obviously, that gives us more flexibility. so its a core mainstay of our investment strategy and intent. and the magnitude will -- changes in the magnitude will depend on the variables i talked about. but we view it as undervalued and very appealing, both corporately and personally.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
yes, i would agree. a question about...
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
i would also say that as the ramp in earnings is occurring, it gives us more flexibility on the buyback side.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
right. and we would hope that would perhaps change the valuation as well. one question on the sfr portfolio. i understand sort of the initial allocation to the loan side. but as youre thinking forward, are you looking at this sector as more an owner-operator or still as a lender?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, we have a modest position as the lender in this through our business purpose loan investments that have been very attractive, and were very encouraged by, and we are on the lookout for new opportunities in that space every day in business purpose loans, including sfr loans. and were also hopeful about a possible opportunity to expand that capability over the next -- over the coming months. but specifically as to your question about single family rentals, we would conduct this as we have on the msr side through a partnership with a highly credible owner operator, and we would be partnered with them in owning and operating a portfolio of single-family rental homes and taking advantage of that by financing it through term structures, term and nonterm, but term structures ideally, ultimately, available to institutional level investors in that asset class that have become increasingly compelling from a financing cost and advanced and term structure perspective.
so the combination of the supply demand dynamic, the funding dynamic at the home level in the housing market in the united states, and specifically, from a funding capability for institutional level investors in that space. the combination of all those things produces, we think, an attractive return profile, not just from the carry, the net carry of the rent stream versus the funding cost, but also including the potential for additional appreciation from here, obviously, we would not expect appreciation levels to continue at their recent historical levels. but we would -- but we are positive and constructive on the overall supply demand and price dynamic in the single-family rental space over time.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
okay. got it. and one last question, and ill jump out. a follow-up on trevors on the msr. i would assume that the acquisitions on the msr, the additional $14 million doesnt materially change the note rate, but lets use $2.94. i mean, youd have to see primary rates to borrowers to be $2.40 something before youre meaningfully in the money. is it your expectation that, that happens? and if its not, and rates move back up materially, where do you think this multiple based on your analysis could go from four times to what?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, a couple of things there. as i said before, an agreement with you that wed have to see -- we think wed have to see prime rates in the lower 2s in order to really create a substantial surge in that prepayment and a reduction in the cash flow features. so thats not our expectation, but we are hedged for it. so were hedging every day to that dynamic as a possibility. thats one of the compelling flexibility elements that the combination of the msr with the agency portfolio provides. is it perfect? no, it cant be perfect in every circumstance. but we are hedging for exactly that dynamic against the msr book, knowing that as rates go up, that theres a substantial opportunity for both the improvement in the cash flows as prepayment rates decline, but also the expansion in the multiple. now historically, we would have seen pre-pandemic multiples well above current levels. were not expecting that into a higher rate move, but the combination of a multiple expansion from right now, maybe in the four range, right around 4%. so something more like 4.25% or so, plus the change in the cash flows we expect would provide for a substantial surge in value in an uprate move in that msr portfolio and provide really attractive current returns, but also protection against the agency portfolio that is growing off its own set of returns and hedging the down rate protection -- down rate scenario against the msrs.
jason stewart -- jonestrading -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking the questions. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
rock, do you anticipate increasing the capital allocation msrs in the third quarter?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, weve already -- as we said in the script, chris, we already have allocated additional $14 million to that portfolio in the third quarter. and i think theres room for that to migrate up to some degree, additionally. i think that will depend on where we see relative -- where we see multiples and relative returns in that. we continue to see flow, some of -- some of which we think is attractive. and so we continue to bid tranches of that, both through the flow agreements that we have in place as well as limited bulk opportunities. i think -- so i think we would expect that, that probably would grow some during the third quarter, additionally. and keep in mind, we do have a committed facility available to us. we havent used it yet, but we do have that flexibility. so im not sure we would see the capital allocation increase that much, but we may begin to apply some leverage as we further deploy the rest of the balance sheet. and i think that would have the consequence of improving returns on the msr portfolio into the lower double digits from the high single digits.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and then is there any type of mortgages -- excuse me, for the msr book, is there any type of mortgages that youre targeting to be the receiver of the economics?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, were looking -- what were evaluating typically is a current coupon mortgage thats been originated at reasonably proximate to the current rates. so at a given point in time, were investing in a right underlying pool of mortgages that were originated in recent history at something around the then current coupon. today, that current coupon is going to be in the high 2s, and were going to -- and it would cost about four times to buy it -- youd buy it. and that circumstance to what would model to about an eight, give or take, eight unlevered return, but our experience has actually been that the model to 8s have turned in to be more like 9s and above. so thats been our actual experience is that the actual receipt of cash flows have exceeded our expectations. it generally, generically, this origination that were investing in is going to look like bank or savings and loan originated paper generically. and its all fannie -- and its all basically fannie mae back.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from doug harter with credit suisse.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. rock, can you just talk about -- given the way youre structuring some of these investments for the msrs or if you look at single families as partnerships, how much does scale matter? and just how do you think about the benefits of diversity versus kind of not being able to deploy that much capital into any one investment opportunity?
j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, i think thats one of the compelling elements of the approach that were taking, doug, is that were able to access the scale of a very significant organizations to -- and do that without the infrastructure intensity that one would have to undertake to do that directly. so in essence, thats a form of leverage, meaning its operational leverage, right? so were benefiting from operational leverage and benefit from their scale. weve seen the benefit of that now in msrs and to the extent that we proceed down the sfr path, we expect to see the same benefit. so what that means is that it allows us to invest and provide a level of diversification between complementary investment opportunities that provide together an attractive combination of returns.
can each be financed to the extent that, thats necessary to support returns, can each be financed in favorable financing structures from a cost and term perspective, and work together to offset risks in each of the others. so thats the goal. so far, the msr opportunity is playing out that way. its early days, but its playing out that way. the expectation would be that we can leverage scale of a highly credible partner in the single-family rental opportunity as well. and to the extent we can do that, we can enjoy the same benefit of an attractive return stream without the infrastructure intensity. so we think it actually aids diversity and returns and allows us as a smaller company to participate with positive and powerful economics in spaces that we wouldnt otherwise at our scale, but can do so through these arrangements.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
helpful. thank you rock.

good morning. id like to welcome everyone to the arlington asset second quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] id now like to turn the conference over to richard konzmann. sir, please go ahead.
richard konzmann -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer

j. rock tonkel -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, rich. good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2021 earnings call for arlington asset. also joining me on the call today is john murray, our portfolio manager. during the second quarter, the federal reserve struck a more hawkish tone at its june meeting, leading to market concerns that it may begin to taper its bond purchases and raise interest rates sooner than previously expected, which rallied the 10-year u.s. treasury rate, almost 30 basis points and both flatten the yield curve. against this backdrop, agency mortgage spreads widened and swap spreads tightened during the second quarter. in an improving economy, residential mortgage credit spreads tightened and home price appreciation continued its strong annual growth during the second quarter, supported by favorable supply demand dynamics. the companys long-term strategy is to construct an investment portfolio with multiple sources of income, which complement our historical agency mbs portfolio, diversify risk and improve the level and reliability of returns. over time, the company expects to complement its allocation of capital and agency mortgages by redeploying capital into its other targeted segments, including mortgage servicing rights, mortgage credit and other asset classes.
we expect to maintain a strong, stable and liquid financial position by keeping leverage low and financial flexibility high while utilizing term financing structures where available. in addition, the company is focused on creating proprietary partnerships or platforms where possible to promote the predictability of cash flows, growth and the potential for compounding value creation opportunities layer on top of the current investment returns embedded in the companys investments. during the second quarter, the company made solid progress toward these goals by reallocating capital into both its msr and mortgage credit strategies. as of june 30, the companys investable capital was allocated 39% to agency mortgages, 25% to mortgage servicing rights and 36% to mortgage credit. as discussed on our prior earnings call, the company has a strategic relationship with a licensed gse approved servicer that enables the company to garner the economic return of an investment in mortgage servicing rights without holding the requisite license directly. under the terms of our partnership, the company provides capital to our partner to purchase msrs directly.
and the company, in turn, receives all the economics of the msrs, less a fee payable to our partner. at our option and direction, our partner has the capacity to add leverage to increase potential returns to us, although the company has not utilized any leverage through its committed facility on its msr investment portfolio to date. we believe this efficient, cost-effective and lower risk channel for investing in the economics of mortgage servicing rights differentiates arlington. our msr investment portfolio has produced strong returns year-to-date through june 30, despite the significant fall in long-term interest rates and valuation multiples on mortgage servicing rights have been resilient, declining only slightly during the second quarter. during the quarter, the company made $39 million of new related msr related investments, growing its msr investment portfolio to $75 million or 25% of our investable capital as of quarter end. subsequent to june 30, we have invested an additional $14 million in msr related assets. newly created mortgage servicing rights of fannie mae and freddie mac loans currently offer attractive return opportunities and provide a strong complement to agency mbs investment characteristics at current purchase price multiples of approximately 4 times or current coupon msrs.
unlevered msr investments offer base returns in the high single digits. furthermore, msrs generally increase in value as interest rates rise, agency durations extend and/or mortgage spreads widen. turning to levered agency mbs. returns continue to benefit from low repo funding costs and ongoing federal reserve support. against this backdrop, we are currently seeing available returns in the high single digits on levered agency mbs with an appropriate hedge position. however, a reduction in support from the federal reserve could lead to further widening of agency mortgage spreads, and the company continues to believe there is meaningful basis risk in agency mbs relative to the current spread return opportunity today, and therefore, remains cautious about significantly increasing the leverage and capital allocation to its agency mortgage investment strategy. taken together, incorporating a levered agency mbs investment with msr investment combines investments with complementary characteristics, decreases overall risk while increasing roe. mortgage servicing rights tend to increase in value as mortgage rates rise and more specifically, when durations on agency mbs extend. this increase in value resulting from mortgage extension typically occurs when mismatches between levered agency mbs and hedges are highest.
furthermore, msrs offered attractive stand-alone return in the high single digits and by reducing the need for swaps as a hedge for agency mbs and their associated costs. msrs provide a positive carry hedge for levered agency securities, replacing negative carry swaps with positive carry msrs turns the largest drag unlevered agency mbs returns into a carry positive. going forward, we would expect to replace components of our interest rate swap position on our agency mbs investment portfolio with msrs as the company scales its msr investments, thereby increasing combined returns by several hundred basis points into the low double digits while improving the protection to the companys capital. the underlying credit performance of the companys mortgage credit investments produced solid results during the second quarter, supported by strong economic environment. subsequent to quarter end, the company received full repayment of its largest mortgage credit investment, one that was originated prior to the onset of the pandemic and delivered leverage returns of approximately 13%. the during the second quarter, the company made $58 million of new mortgage credit investments and continues to evaluate new opportunities that offer high risk-adjusted returns, particularly potential opportunities in residential business purpose loans.
turning to the actual results for the quarter. the company reported book value of $5.94 per share as of june 30, a decline of 2.9% from the prior quarter end. the company continued to operate with low overall leverage and significant financial flexibility with an overall at-risk leverage ratio of 2.2 to one as of june 30. for the second quarter, the company reported a gaap net loss of $0.24 per share and growth in operating income, core operating income of $0.04 per share from the prior quarter to a total of $0.07 per share. during the second quarter, the company returned capital to shareholders through accretive stock repurchases by repurchasing 2.6% of its outstanding common stock that accreted $0.05 per share to book value. since june 30, the company repurchased an additional 1.1% of its outstanding common stock that accreted an additional $0.02 per share to book value. the company has a large remaining authorization from its board to repurchase shares of its common stock, and will look to continue to return capital to shareholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of its common stock at accretive prices. company did not declare a dividend on its common stock for the second quarter. the board of directors will continue to evaluate the payment of quarterly dividends on the common stock-based on multiple factors, including current earnings results, overall market conditions, liquidity needs, available returns on new investments, opportunities to return capital to shareholders through accretive stock repurchases and reit distribution requirements.
in july, the company successfully completed a public offering of $37.8 million of five-year unsecured 6% senior notes using the proceeds to redeem its 6.625% senior notes due in 2023 with an outstanding balance of $23.8 million. the issuance allowed the company to both extend the maturity date and lower the interest rate of its debt while also raising additional investable capital at an attractive cost. company has spent considerable time evaluating investment opportunities in single-family rental that offer potential attractive long-term returns supported by favorable supply demand dynamics, a healthy u.s. home financing market, an increasingly flexible term financing structures for institutional level single-family residential investments. we expect this favorable dynamic in u.s. single-family rental homes to continue for some time as we believe the limited supply of new homes will likely not meet the growing demand of housing based on expected demographic trends. the company hopes to make significant progress toward adding this segment to our capital allocation channels and potentially investing in its asset class in the coming quarter.
overall, the company is very encouraged by the solid progress it has made to date in the transition for its long-term goals and is optimistic about its prospects going forward. the company has taken positive steps toward its objective of complementing our core agency mbs portfolio with high return, non-commodity quality investment channels, which provides diversification of risk, multiple income sources to raise overall returns to shareholders and offer sustainable ongoing investment flow. during the second quarter, the scaling of our msr channel provided improved protection to the portfolio from agency mbs rate and spread volatility and raised profitability appreciably. as the company continues to expand its diversified investment strategies, we expect higher returns from these investments to provide increased earnings power over time, which can form the potential pathway for returning additional capital to shareholders.
as that deployment process occurs, we expect to maintain a strong financial position, highlighted by low leverage, high flexibility and the use of term financing structures where possible, enabling the company to be opportunistic and capture attractive investment opportunities that may arise across sectors as conditions evolve, and very importantly, to sustain the ongoing ability to utilize its stock repurchase authority and deliver attractive returns to shareholders over time. thank you very much. operator, i would like to now open the call for questions.
