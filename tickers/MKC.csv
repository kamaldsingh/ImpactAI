lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kasey, good morning everyone. thanks for joining us. starting on slide 4, our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. we delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product, our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategy.
i am incredibly proud of the way mccormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment. we drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees in recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts.
we're also excited about the recent acquisitions of cholula and fona, two fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning mccormick for success in 2021 and beyond.
as seen on slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. the breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings it's a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile time, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. the sustained shift at consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our consumer segment demand, as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our flavor solutions segment.
on the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away from home products in our portfolio. the impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away from home consumption in each, as well as the pace of each regions' covid-19 recovery. taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering.
heading into 2021, i'm confident our operating momentum will continue. in our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the cholula and fona acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income, and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.
this morning, i'll begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements, and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. after that, i will turn it over to mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter-end fiscal year results, as well as the details of our 2021 guidance.
turning to slide 6, starting with the fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call on our top line versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. in constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase.
adjusted operating income declined 4%, as growth from higher sales and cci-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, covid-19-related costs, and higher employee benefit expenses. our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income for the partial offset from lower interest expense.
turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance, starting on slide 7 in our consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6%, or constant currency 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. our americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. our total mccormick u.s.-branded portfolio, as indicated in our iri consumption data, grew 14% which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the u.s. iri consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.
as mentioned in our earnings call at the end of september, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. to protect our top selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution, and consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and closed stores, as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.
focusing on the u.s. branded portfolio in spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. our fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraint this has double-digit growth for the year, as with spices and seasonings and the other key categories.
in the fourth quarter, we continue to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinate, and asian products.the majority of our categories, continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the mccormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as stubb's, lawry's, simply asia and thai kitchen.
and in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with mccormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. while we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home the most recent iri scanner sales data for the five-weeks ending january 17th show total mccormick u.s. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings.
consumers are continuing to come to our brand, have a good experience and buy our products again. in the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions, as planned, with the americas messaging and promotional activities focused on a holiday proving to be successful. with our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. and with the manufacturing capacity we've recently added, we're well-positioned moving into 2021, and we'll continue to drive growth with strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovations.
now turning to emea, our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region at several categories. spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets and our vahine brand in france again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. aand in u.k., frank's redhot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth.
in emea, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. importantly, for the full year, we gained total emea region's market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. in the asia-pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our consumer segment in this region.
the foodservice industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace. growth in china was also impacted by a shift to a later chinese new year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at gourmet garden and frank's redhot in australia.
turning to slide 8, our sales performance in flavor solutions return to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3% and all three regions contributed to the sales growth. in both our americas and emea regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base with the strength in the base business, as well as momentum with new products.
also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away from home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. the net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove emea's fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and then the americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice growth of 2%.
in the asia-pacific region our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by australia and china's growth with quick service restaurant for qsr customers, but we continue to see momentum at limited time offers and the core business partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.
moving from our fourth quarter results, i'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments. it's not only highlight what we've achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on slide 9, we grow 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our consumer segment led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the flavor solutions segment as covid-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurant and other foodservice customer.
we achieved $113 million of annual cost savings driven by our cci program, our fuel for growth and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings. 2020 was the ninth consecutive year with record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. we're making great progress with our working capital improvements. at year-end, our board of directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. we have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.
now i would like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. e-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding, with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties.
we expect the consumer shift increased online shopping to continue and we are well-positioned for the opportunities still ahead. we continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing at 7% in fiscal 2020. most recently, with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021.
we designed targeted media and messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. our digital leadership was again recognized, as we were ranked as the number 1 food brand with the highest designation of genius by gartner l2 research in their digital iq u.s. ranking.
this is the seventh year in a row, we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands. we continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. during 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year, as a diversityinc top 50 company. and earlier this week, corporate knights ranked mccormick in their 2021 global 100 most sustainable corporations index, as a number 1 in the food products industry for the 5th consecutive year, as well as the number 1 u.s. company overall and globally number 6 overall.
finally, during the year, we continue to invest to expand our global infrastructure. in the americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art northeast distribution center in maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. in our emea region, we began construction on the new flavor solutions' manufacturing facility in the u.k. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. in china, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive flavor solutions' growth. these investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.
turning to 2021, mike will go over our guidance in a few moments. but i'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plan.
starting on slide 11, in addition to the accomplishments i just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms with the recent acquisitions of cholula and fona. cholula, an iconic brand and a high growth category is a leading mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators. fona, a leading north american manufacturer of flavors increases the scale of our global flavors platform, with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our flavor solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration, more value-added and technically insulated products.
we're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from cholula and fona, which closed at the end of november and december respectively. for both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is under way to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth.
we have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock cholula's significant growth potential. in our consumer segment we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extended its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration.
building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum cholula carried into 2021 continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. in our flavor solutions segment with our broad presence across all foodservice channels we'll be focusing on strengthening cholula's go-to-market model.
there are opportunities to expand cholula's distribution and its existing foodservice channel, as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. mccormick's reach across customers combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends expands the recipe inspiration and flavor solutions that we offered to operators.
turning to fona, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration will be the cornerstone for accelerating our americas flavor platform. by expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offerings, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth.
with the addition of fona, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. we're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform, with additional proprietary and cancellation methods including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition product across a variety of applications.
our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of fona's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus fruit flavors. combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better for you, the consumer preferred flavor solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. our complementary customer base is a global and mid-tier customers provide growth opportunities for our collective portfolios.
bonus customer-centric culture is very similar to ours and with the combined power of our organizations we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. customer response to the acquisition has been favorable, as they recognized our combined power increases our customer value proposition.
we're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. this confidence is bolstered by our proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of our businesses, such as our acquisition of frank's and french's. acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy in both cholula and fona will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions. now, i'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plans starting on slide 14.
global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. we're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. our alignment with these consumer trends combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio sustainably positions us for continued growth. these underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
starting with our consumer segment. around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trends of consumers cooking more at home.
across our apz region, consumer demand continues to be strong. in china, consumer consumption remains strong and we continue to see recovery in foodservice within china is in our consumer segment, as well as optimism about the chinese new year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the covid-19-related lockdown and then, australia, either with restaurant restrictions eased and away from home demand increasing at-home consumption has remained elevated. in emea, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive covid-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption and we're seeing sustained levels of demand, and of course, we'd see the same in the americas.
consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their new locations is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better tasting and cost less.
and while there has been great advances in vaccine development and distribution there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. we believe, the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new product and our strong category management initiatives.
our categories across the globe experienced the sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift preference, which coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operation. the real pressure has been on our u.s. manufacturing operations where the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. we ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan.
in december, our americas' consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. currently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top selling products. we've now resumed shipping approximately two-thirds of the products, which had been suspended with the balance to be added over the next several weeks, and we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. we're continuing to work through a stabilization period and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year.
our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both of our -- both our customers and mccormick, i'd like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us on long-term solution. we're confident, we're well positioned for success in 2021, and have implemented efficient long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth.
also in the u.s. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience our spices and seasonings consumer by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. our rollout will continue in 2021, and with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and mccormick branded growth.
turning to global brand marketing, we continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high roi. we will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration. for instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and products to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy.
we expect our brand marketing investments combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020. new products are also integral to our sales growth, in 2020, 7% of our total mccormick sales were from products launched in the last three years. in our consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. our 2020 launches provides significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial.
overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovation from our flavor solutions' customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline both we and our flavor solutions' customers are carrying into the year.
in our flavor solutions segment we have a diverse customer base, we have seen various stages of recovery. from a food at home perspective our flavor solutions' growth varies by packaged food customer, but overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-covid growth rates. we're carrying our growth momentum of packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic product, as well as new product and bigger-best innovation in 2021.
our away from home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government imposed covid-19 restrictions in most markets. some areas, our restaurant customers including quick service restaurants have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. although, the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis even many customers have adapted their operating models for delivery carried out. the recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by covid-19 resurgences.
overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. as qsr customers are oriented less to dine-in their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. we have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum.
we were advantaged by a differentiated customer engagements in flavor solutions, and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. with our customer intimacy approach we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans, and importantly further strengthen our customer partnerships.
additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. with top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale our momentum in flavor categories, as well as opportunities from our fona acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
in summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our consumer segment as positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the flavor solutions' recovery and are excited about our cholula and fona acquisition, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021.
we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of covid-19 recovery, but importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth, as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary covid-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.
our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we're positioned for continued success. importantly, mccormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. during 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, now i'd like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment.
now, mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning everyone. i will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full-year results, as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.
starting on slide 19, during the fourth quarter sales rose 4% in constant currency. sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our consumer segment with volume and mix in our flavor solutions segment comparable to last year. pricing, to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.
the consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency, led by the americas and emea regions. a sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home, as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.
on slide 20, consumer segment sales in the americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands including simply asia, thai kitchen, frank's redhot, french's, lawry's, zatarain's, gourmet garden and stubb's, to name a few. partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in mccormick's branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes, as well as private label products due to capacity constraints.
in emea, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago with strong growth in all countries across the region. the most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our schwartz and ducros branded spices and seasonings, our vahine homemade dessert products and our kamis branded products in poland. consumer sales in the asia-pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later chinese new year as lawrence mentioned.
turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 23, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all three regions. in the americas, flavor solutions' constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases offset partially by lower volume and product mix. volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasoning.
in emea, constant currency sales increased 5% attributable to pricing to cover cost increases, as well as higher volume and product mix. volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies, with strength in snack seasonings partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers.
in the asia-pacific region flavor solutions' sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to qsrs in china and australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. as seen on slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction cost related to the cholula and fona acquisitions and special charges declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period with minimal impact from currency.
adjusted operating income declined in the consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. in the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. growth from higher sales and cci-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers.
in the consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth and in the flavor solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to it's adjusted operating income decline. both segments were also unfavorably impacted by covid-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation.
as seen on slide 28, gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year-ago period, as we have planned. adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors i've mentioned a moment ago, as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.
for the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by cci-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset covid-19-related costs. adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. the consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% at constant currency primarily, due to higher sales and cci-led cost savings, partially offset by 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and covid-19-related costs.
in constant currency, the flavor solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20% driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, covid-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense with a partial offset from cci-led cost savings.
turning to income taxes on slide 29, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year-ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. for the full year our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full year was comparable to 2019.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79, as compared to $0.81 for the year-ago period. the decline was primarily, driven by our lower adjusted operating income partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. for the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.
on slide 32, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record-high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. we finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle, down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end, as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. we returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the frank's redhot and french's brands.
following the acquisitions of cholula and fona, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 3.9 times, and we expect to delever to approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2022. based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and or anticipate a strong cash flow generation we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.
our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our erp business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that lawrence mentioned earlier. in 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020, as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as support our investment to fuel future growth.
we expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
now, i would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our erp replacement program first. starting with our erp replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. we're now projecting the total cost of our erp investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. as such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.
in fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million with our fiscal 2020. and at this time, we are not anticipating any significant rollouts in 2021. by the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. we are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform.
moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well-positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. in our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental covid-19 cost and the erp investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. we also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.
at the top line, we expect to grow the constant currency sales 5% to 7% including the incremental impact of the cholula and fona acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. we anticipate our organic growth will be primarily, led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans.
as lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the covid-19 recovery, but importantly, we expect we will drive our overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the cholula and fona acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and covid-19 costs. we have to make covid-19 cost to be approximately $60 million in 2021, as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year.
fiscal 2021's covid-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs, and of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations. our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased covid-19 cost and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental erp investment. this results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. this projection includes low-single digit inflationary pressure and our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. it also includes an estimated low-single digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.
our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earning by geographies, as well as factoring in a low -- level of discrete impacts. this outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind for our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 4%. our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact i just mentioned related to covid-19 cost, our incremental erp investment and the tax headwind.
this resulted an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96 compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as covid-19 cost and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year.
we have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. in summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid-19 cost and the erp investment, as well as our higher projected effective tax rate. i like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 35. we delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies.
we have a strong foundation. we're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. we are excited about the recent acquisitions of cholula and fona, which reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiments flavors growth platform. we are confident these investments further position us for continued success. our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever, our 2021 outlook reflects another year differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. we are confident, we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times. now, let's turn to your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your question.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everybody. thanks for the question.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi, there. lawrence, thank you for the additional color in consumer americas around some of the capacity and service level dynamics that you're facing over the last couple of months or quarters. i guess, first off, i'm curious if those dynamics are in such a place now where we should expect sort of shipments to start to outpace consumption sort of in 1q and 2q or if you expect still may be somewhat of a lag effect because you're still building the capacity in the service levels to where you want them to be?
so i'm trying to just dimensionalize that to our first quarter aspect, but more importantly, how to dimensionalize maybe how big of a benefit to 2001 organic growth, just a rebuilding of inventory levels to the extent that needs to happen can be to organic growth? and then, i just have a quick follow-up. thank you.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. well, andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter, both, really through the third and fourth quarter. as we talked about on previous calls, and anybody that walks into a store can see that the shelves are pretty poor condition. there are lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes that reflects the fact that we've had our secondary skus on suspension to protect the key holiday items. and it's really been those two categories have had the greatest impact.
our other product categories have had a pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. so that's been our focus area. we have -- starting at the beginning of january, begun reinstating those secondary items and so, they are coming back on. as we said in our prepared remarks about two-thirds of them has been reinstated and plus the remainder coming in the coming weeks. so i think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. we still are allocating product. there is a big bow waves of demand ahead of us, as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. and frankly everyone forgets about consumer pantries does not being a bit fair during this time as well.
so we do expect there to be probably a benefit to this fiscal year. and so, we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half, in terms of the rebuild of consumer inventories. i also want to emphasize that this is an americas problem. our manufacturing has really it's been -- able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. it's just the scale of our consumer business in the americas is so great. particularly in the fourth quarter of the year, even in normal circumstances, we have to pre-build inventories and supply there. it's the huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. and coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. that's why we were signaling that we're going to have service issues through the fourth quarter, we knew that to be the case. i won't say, just commenting on current conditions and i don't want to get too much into 202, we're almost two-thirds of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers while we're still allocating product there -- it's the -- it's a best service that we've had since the spring.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
no. thank you for that and then a super quick follow-up. i found your comments very interesting around the trends you're seeing in australia. as restrictions ease, consumption of at-home items still remains elevated at this point and some other companies have said similar things. i've also heard similar things be discussed around china for some companies as well, there as restrictions have eased and i may have missed it. are you seeing that same dynamic in your china business as well?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's not quite.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
or more not much?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. we are, but it's not quite as clean in china, because in china, they have actually reinstated some restrictions now. it's not the same as it was a year ago when there was a government lockdown. but their government is encouraging people not to travel, is encouraging people to celebrate chinese new year at-home. generally in china, when their government gives encouragement to do something you do it. and so, i think that is --- that right now for chinese new year, i'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior.
it's not quite as clean as in australia, where covid seems to be under control. restrictions have been lifted and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home. i think during 2021 chinese new year is later in the first quarter. so it will -- after that they will have a better read on it.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
yeah i think so.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
andrew, there are couple of other companies who've commented on it, and i'll just say it again, our consumer research both the syndicated information that we get on our own proprietary research says consumers are enjoying cooking more at home, three out of four consumer say it relaxes them and reduces their stress, only a quarter consumer says they actually intend to cook more at home after the pandemic than they are even now. and with that added uncertainty around vaccine timing and the take-up of the vaccine and new variance emerging, i think that there is a lot of reason i believe consumption is going to be elevated this year at least for quite some time.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, very much.

the next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks so much.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, ken.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to ask -- hey, everybody. i think you mentioned when you talked about the sales drivers --
organic sales drivers for '21, i think you mentioned volume and product mix. unless i missed it, i think i heard pricing. so i'm curious, do you expect pricing to play any major role in your growth this year? and as a corollary to that, how might you maybe describe the willingness of your customers to kind of accept price sites at this time?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. well, ken, first of all, pricing is an ongoing discussion with customers. i don't want to get too specific about pricing actions that haven't been taken because of customer and competitive reasons certainly. and so, our comments on that are pretty limited right now. i'll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are due to flavor solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on our contractual relationship for this, a pass-through of pricing. we -- i don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe some other companies.
our outlook is for low-to-single digit inflation. we have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers, but we do use cci as well. we are seeing cost inflations. freight is up, ocean freight in particular is an emerging -- a current and emerging concern, but we're really not prepared to talk about. i can't give any specific comments about pricing right now. we you have some graphs from 2020 of pricing actions and where we need to take pricing in 2021 we're confident we can take it.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you for that. and then for my follow-up you're balancing a lot of things right now that some might consider outside what might be the normal course of business, right. you're undertaking in erp implementation or at least you're starting to, right. you're integrating two acquisitions, you're navigating through covid. so can you just help us think about how you and your team are maybe balancing some of the balls in the air right now or keeping them in the air? and how you sort of allocate your time, your -- to the day-to-day blocking and tackling if you're just selling core products? there is a lot, sort of going on right now at the company?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, ken, well, there is a lot going on but i think that we can handle it. we have a strong ambition to grow, we've been choiceful about priorities, and so we suspended our business transformation and erp activity last year in order to make sure that we could focus on dealing with the crisis and keep our people safe our quality up, do all the right things for business continuity and come out stronger. but that was a pause, not a -- it's not a suspension. we paused our activity and we think we've got the resources to ramp it back up. even during that pause, we spent some time rescoping realigning partners i think and we've actually come out of it with a stronger program.
we've got a lot of data cleansing done at that those who have been through this before, know that's always an issue. and so, we feel pretty good about our ability to handle that, handle the recovery of our business and we really are actually quite thrilled about the two acquisitions that we made. we've added a great asset to each one of our segments. we think that this has been a great capital allocation decision and the integration of these are pretty straightforward i think. mike, you want to comment on that?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, definitely. the integration is going very well. i mean, with cholula obviously, is more of a plug and play. it's still like -- look like what we said. so that's a pretty straightforward one, and fona has a great business. and as i said before, it's discrete teams focusing on them and helping integrate into our business. so it's not taking away from the base focus we need on the core business if that's kind of where to go about.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. i was just curious, but that's a helpful answer. thank you, gentlemen.

the next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your question.
alexia howard -- sanford bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
morning, alexia.
alexia howard -- sanford bernstein -- analyst
hi, there. so my first question actually goes to e-commerce. i just wonder where you ended up fiscal '20 in terms of e-commerce, as the percent of sales. and has that slowed down at all in the later part of the year? i'm just wondering what the prognosis is in terms of growth on that side?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we've got tremendous growth in e-commerce. as we went through the year, we've talked about it a couple times and as i tell it everybody else. and i know our own experiences anecdotally or that many of us have shopped on the e-commerce. now if you take all three legs of e-commerce, as we think about it, dtc, pure-play, and our click-and-collect type customer brick and mortar efforts all of that was up well over 100% on a global scale. and our -- and while we don't actually disclose the total percentage of our business that is from e-commerce, on the consumer side, it's less than 10% but it's up substantially from past years and continuing a long trend of shift by consumers to shopping with e-commerce.
alexia howard -- sanford bernstein -- analyst
right. and then as my follow-up, as ken mentioned, there is an awful lot of uncertainty out there, we're still living through these unprecedented time. if you think about your outlook for 2021, what do you think the biggest uncertainties are may be positively and negatively in terms of the risks in either direction? thank you, and i'll pass it on.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i think the biggest uncertainty is i mean, it's also the most obvious one, is the pace of recovery from the pandemic, and the durability of the consumer behavior is coming out of it. and the -- and really it's more the recovery of the foodservice side that we wonder about than the whether consumers are going to continue to cook at home. i think there is just -- i don't think that there is a pretty broad range of possible outcomes, but again, vaccine take-up, huge variance that might come up. so those are some pretty -- that i'd say that's the biggest uncertainty factor out there.
i will say that we're managing through this now on a much more, let's say mandates than operational basis rather than in a crisis mode. and so -- and i think we're very well prepared for tough lockouts in the market. you want to add anything to this?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, we're prepared for any environment, we have broad and diversified portfolio, just like we showed last year to have that kind of sales growth and then performance, we can manage any environment. and i think the to lawrence's point is because we think these consumers trends will be sticky, although, people will go out more to eat as the vaccine becomes more global, but you think we've created some habits as market goes away.
alexia howard -- sanford bernstein -- analyst
wonderful. thank you, i'll pass it on.

our next question is from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your questions.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, rob.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. i wanted to know about the guidance for the first half of the year. i think you said the earnings growth is going to be back-half weighted. but when i look at the first quarter coming up, you seem to have a very easy comparison to a year ago in the core operations, which were down in sales and down in ebit. i think i and others have a pretty outsized first quarter expectation fundamentally because of inventory reloading, and i guess, improving in performance in flavor solutions as well. so can you help us think about first quarter a little bit too? you mentioned the tax rate, but other than that, is it actually going to be a strong start in first quarter?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, rob, it's mike. i'll take that one. i mean, it's a great point. i mean we did highlight the first-half, second-half story. within the first half, there are two stories also. obviously, if the ed comparison, especially from a consumer perspective in the first quarter as we expect, we're off to a strong. i'll start this year, as you would expect, as you can see from our consumption data in the u.s. primarily. we also knew we're lapping a really strong second quarter and.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
right.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think it's something as you look at your modeling, you want to adjust to that assumption. tax rate, we know, is a really tough comparison in the first quarter compared to last year, which was highlighted, but in the first half, as we talked about we're going to have covid cost that will be across those quarters primarily in the first half. significant investment in a&p, as we drive our brands, as we recover really in the first quarter too, but in the second quarter also but-yeah.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and i'll also -- just and for the second half as you think about it, our covid costs are higher in the first half but we begin to get them out of the business in the second half whereas a year ago that's when we were really ramping up on. i think things are going expensive relative to covid, and so we'll have the unwinding of that as a bit of a tailwind in the second half of the year as well.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and you'll see things like erp cost build throughout the year, sort of you again in first half, second half could be kind of more weighted to the second half.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, and a follow-up. i was surprised to see flavor solutions positive in fourth quarter and you mentioned, it's really driven by cpg. is there a way to break out how much growth you're seeing in cpg right now, and how much of a decline, you're seeing in the other half of the flavor solutions' business, which is more foodservice oriented? and would you would expect that relationship to continue in 2021?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think i'll answer that one, lawrence can add in there. i mean, we're seeing and we're not going to give you percentages because it really varies by region based on the split of our packaged versus restaurant. but in the americas, we've seen very strong cpg performance, mid-to-high single digits offset by similar ranges on the branded foodservice and restaurant side. but it's the mix of the business in regions, which give you that. but overall being positive, we're very thrilled with that. we know a lot of people were surprised by that even though consumer grew very strongly.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
if i were to point to one thing where we were -- where may be our sales performance for the fourth quarter was different than our expectations, it would be in this area of flavor solutions, it was a bit stronger across the board than we would have thought when we gave the year-end guidance.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. all right, thanks.

our next question is coming from the line of faiza alwy with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning. so first, i just wanted to ask lawrence. you'd made a comment early on about the pricing disconnect that we're seeing in nielsen. so i just -- i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that, maybe clarify. and what i'm really trying to get at is i think andrew had asked the question around the -- if there is any quantification of what the inventory reload might be in the first half? that would be really helpful.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. i think those are two different questions, but on pricing there are two things that are happening in nielsen that i think it looked like there is more pricing perhaps than there actually is. the first is that there has been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis where i'd say regular rate -- i'd say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels and it tends to carry a higher price point as a result. that comes through as pricing inflection in the nielsen data, that is really kind of artificial numbers, one of the things that i was pointing to.
and then the other is, there is still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. and not just for us, but across the board that comes through as i look at the price increase in the nielsen data. as far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there is going to be a substantial catch-up on trade stock as that we have shipped to -- we have shipped under consumption now for three quarters, and i think you can expect that we will. as our americas supply chain catches up that will -- you'll start to see our shipping above consumption. our consumption is still very strong. i mentioned that our production was up 40% in december for our u.s. consumer business and then the market took all of that and it's just -- there is still lasted through.
when we talk about the inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock, it's for us it's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. i think that, that's going to be a gradual process, as we go through the first half of the year.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, understood. and then i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how retailers are thinking about? you had mentioned shelf free alignment. last year, you'd spend a significant amount of time talking about that at cagny, and i know some of those efforts were paused. how should we think about the timing of that as we go into this year?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we do have a reinvention of the spice aisle, and it's an important category management program that is good both -- it's a a win-win. it's great for the customers and it's great for us. although, we didn't make as much progress on that last year, as we would have hoped when we were talking about it at cagny, we were able to impact a little over 5,000 stores last year. so we did continue that effort even with the pandemic going on.
and we would expect to get a like number of stores again in 2021, which is really between us, the two years is quite enough to really move the needle. and so we're continuing with those efforts that we think are important. yeah, this has also been -- had been a chance to rethink the assortment in the category and so, we've taken a look as part of this move to -- it reduces the number of items in the store for their section. we've also looked at the assortment that we offer, and we've sku rationalized out part of the early long tail of products that we have. so about 250 items in the herbs, spice, seasoning and recipe mix category to simplify our assortment as well.

adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, adam
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. i just wanted to maybe clarify a little bit of this point on channel kind of inventory kind of restocking or getting your -- the shelves restocked, not necessarily even the backward house inventories restock. at the segment level, or at the company level you're guiding organic revenue growth of about 1.5% to 3%, 3.5% a year for the full year. we've talked about kind of there being some unfavorable segment mix so presumably, we're going to have expectations of the consumer business being a little below that and flavor solutions above that baseline.
and the consumer business does have a a tailwind of -- from this restocking benefit if you think about the first half because you've been under-shipping consumption. now, i understand the consumption comps get exceedingly difficult as you get into march, april, may. but i'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that with some inventory, we're thinking about, i mean, it is hard to restock, we're thinking about kind of flat up 2% or so consumer growth. and i'm trying to make sure i understand the moving pieces within that.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'm not sure i could address each one of those points, but our expectation is for our consumer segment to grow in 2021, independent of the acquisition that we made. many of our categories have been in full supply through the whole crisis. all of this discussion about inventory stocking at ppps predominantly in herbs, spices seasoning and recipe mixes. this growth is going to vary from quarter to quarter. i think we're going to lap some extraordinary consumption. so while consumption is still running strong for us. the most recent period was still 11.5%. and that includes the fact that we've got -- we got all of those caps on the shelf. and that is -- that's really strong and quite elevated and that compares to over 50% consumption growth in q2. and i believe that it's the number 30 something.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. that was 30 some odd numbers are at the tip of my fingers right now in q3. and so, we're going to earn a lot on those some pretty tough comps for the consumer business up for the americas. and now exactly the same numbers for comparable peaks coming across emea. so that's going to be a bit of a headwind as we go pass the -- i think, we've talked about a lot of flavor solutions business being a little lumpy, because it's based on customer demand and things like that.
consumer will be lumpy this year because of the quarterly comparisons, so much happened last year by quarter is that you're going to have to -- we're going to help you through that. but we're giving broad guidance for the year, which makes it a little difficult, because most of us have already forgotten 2020.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess i have a quick follow-up just talking about low-single digit kind of raw material cost inflation, maybe this is more for mike. just maybe go through some of the key buckets in terms of there is freight packaging. any specific pockets of -- on the actual raw materials that are maybe more concerning from the inflationary side that we should be focused on there?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, as lawrence mentioned, we have a broad market basket of things, which are very different than our peers. and you have the normal big volume items in summer up and summer down, but nothing stands out particularly. i mean, we all know every one in the industry is getting hit recently by ocean freight and other freight -- that's in our market basket so we see low-single digits. we don't break it out, but 70% of our costs are really -- it's really raw material and packaging. so that's -- but there is nothing i would say that is great at this point.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think the bigger impact frankly is the incremental and extraordinary expenses for dealing with the covid crisis that are right now, running through our business that we expect to get out as we get into the second half.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. all right. so that's really helpful. i'll pass it on. thank you.

hey guys, good morning. thank you for taking the question.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, peter.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
lawrence, maybe just to go back to andrew lazar's question, around china. i guess maybe what's under-appreciated is, the idea that organic growth in consumer probably relies at least to some extent on china foodservice making a pretty remarkable come back. we've heard about some retrenchment there recently. i think in your prepared remarks, you said as well. can you just maybe give us a look into how you're thinking about that recovery of your china foodservice customers for the balance of '21? and then i have a follow-up.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well if we talk about china, i'm expecting that we're going to have a very strong recovery in china. china had a very strong response to the covid crisis with a very comprehensive lockdown, consumers, did not have a chance to shop. and so the results in china in the first and second quarter last year were really depressed. and so, i expect to see a very strong rebound from that as we lap those numbers. and additionally, i think that there is a little bit of a benefit from chinese new year being selected later this year than last year. some of our chines new year volumes that would have normally shift at the end of our fiscal year actually it's falling in the fourth quarter and so that's going to be also at the favorable comparison.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. now, that's helpful. then, mike, maybe just...
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
those are verticals for the last year.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
right, right. and mike maybe just one clean-up. i don't know, it's been in your outlook there if you had given on interest expense. but just anything there would be helpful.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i mean, obviously you can calculate. we've talked about our assumptions on the acquisitions for it is in the models so that's an incremental cost in 2021, and we've got a natural decline in some of other based parts portfolio, as we aggressively paid out that last year. but overall interest expense is up obviously.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and peter, it's related to your question. we spent up on a&p in the fourth quarter in every region of the world, including in china to make sure that our consumer business was off to a strong start that a&p is not just for immediate business performance, but for long-term brand building and china was one of the markets that we invested additional a&p and in the fourth quarter of last year that will help us to get the good start on 2021.

lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kasey.
good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.
starting on slide 4. our first quarter results were outstanding. as we said in our year-end earnings call in january, we have confidence in our strategies and are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021. following an extraordinary year in 2020, in 2021 we expect strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary covid-19 cost and business transformation investments highlighting our focus on profit realization. during the first quarter, we delivered double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth. we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of covid-19 recovery. but importantly, we have started the year with outstanding first quarter performance, giving us confidence in an even stronger outlook for 2021.
as seen on slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. the breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance, as evidenced again by our first quarter results.
the sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home continued to drive substantial increases in our consumer segment demand in all regions as well as increases in our packaged food company customers in our flavor solutions segment. on the other hand, in our americas and emea regions, we continued to experience reduced demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers given the pressure on away-from-home consumption driven by continued covid-19 government imposed restrictions which in several areas increased during the first quarter. notably, our apz region had substantial growth in both segments, driven not only by lapping the significant disruption last year caused by the covid-19 related lockdown in china, but also by the sustained increase in at-home consumption and an increase in away from home consumption as restrictions have eased and the recovery momentum is building. finally, with the addition of our cholula and fona acquisitions, we have further extended the reach and breadth of our portfolios, with new product offerings, channels and customers and are excited about their contributions to our first quarter and beyond. these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident our balanced portfolio will continue to differentiate mccormick and sustainably position us for growth.
this morning, i'll begin with our first quarter results, share some comments on business performance and then discuss our 2021 momentum and growth plans. after that, mike will go more in depth on our first quarter results and provide an update on our 2021 guidance.
starting with our outstanding first quarter results, as seen on slide 6. total sales grew 22%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency. in constant currency, we grew total sales 20%, with increases in both segments. base business growth, new products and acquisitions, our three long-term growth drivers, all contributed to the increase. in addition to our top line growth, adjusted operating income increased 35%, including a 3% favorable impact from currency, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points. growth from higher sales, favorable mix and cci-led cost savings more than offset covid-19 related costs and higher planned brand marketing investments. our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 compared to $0.54 in the prior year, driven by our strong operating performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate.
turning to our first quarter segment business performance. starting on slide 7. in our consumer segment, we grew sales by 35%; on constant currency, 32%, with double-digit increases across each of our three regions. our americas constant currency sales growth was 30% in the first quarter, with incremental sales from our cholula acquisition contributing 5%. the momentum cholula carried in from last year continues to be strong, with consumption growing at twice the category rate. excluding cholula, our total mccormick us branded portfolio, as indicated in our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 15%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continued to cook more at home.
for the first time in several quarters, our sales increase was higher than our us iri consumption growth. we are realizing the benefit of our capacity expansion at the end of last year. the difference between shipments and consumption is attributable to beginning to catch up on the undershipment of consumption across all quarters of last year that resulted in depleted retailer and consumer pantry inventories. demand has remained high as the steps we've taken to increase supply are beginning to show. as we mentioned in our january earnings call, after experiencing real pressure on our us manufacturing operations throughout 2020 due to elevated demand levels, we ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity and restoration plans for products which had been suspended. throughout our first quarter, we removed products from suspension and continued to see service levels improve, which, combined with our overshipping consumption, indicates we are beginning to rebuild the inventory pipeline. as we've said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. we continue to work with all our customers on improving shelf conditions and estimate more than half the suspended products are now back on shelf. the level of restoration is very customer specific.
focusing further on our us branded portfolios. in spice and seasonings and all other categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew first quarter consumption at double-digit rates and again increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. in the first quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including snacks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinates and asian products. the categories most impacted affected by supply constraints, spice and seasonings and dry recipe mix, we know there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. products that have had strong supply and remained on shelf have performed well, and as suspended products are restocked on shelf, we're seeing similar performance. we anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve.
all of our key categories continued to outpace the center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the mccormick brand, but smaller brands as well such as stubb's, lawry's, simply asia, thai kitchen, zatarain's and kitchen basics. and in e-commerce, we had strong double-digit pure-play growth, with mccormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. we continue to use our strong category management capabilities in working with our customers as inventory is replenished throughout the supply chain to optimize category shelf sets, drive both growth for our customers and for mccormick. i'd like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us on long-term solutions. we are well positioned for success in 2021 and have implemented efficient long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency to support continued growth.
now turning to emea, which continued its momentum with outstanding performance in the first quarter. our constant currency sales rose 26%, with broad-based growth across the region. each of our markets drove double-digit total branded consumption growth, with market share gains across the region. spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, driving market share gains across total emea region. and our vahine brand in france again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. in the uk, both frank's redhot and french's mustard also had strong consumption and gained share. since the beginning of the pandemic, our emea supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and this has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region.
in emea, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyer increased again in the first quarter for the fourth consecutive quarter across our major brands and markets compared to last year, and we continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that elevated consumer demand will be met, even obtaining incremental placement for our branded portfolio as other manufacturers and private label faced supply challenges. we're excited with our growth trajectory in emea following challenging market conditions in the past.
in the asia-pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 55%. during the first quarter of last year, china's consumption was disrupted by the covid-19 related lockdown. recovering from that disruption increased sales in the first quarter of 2021 versus last year. notwithstanding that recovery, the region still had double-digit growth, driven by strong china consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially fueled by the chinese new year holiday as well as strong consumer consumption in the rest of the region. for instance, in australia, we continued to see elevated consumption in the brands where we gained household penetration last year such as frank's redhot, gourmet garden and grill mates.
across all regions, we know second quarter consumption will start to be compared to the highly elevated levels from last year. and while we do not expect consumption at those same levels, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers' cooking more at home.
constant currency sales in our flavor solutions segment grew 3%, driven by our americas and apz regions. in the americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 2%, driven by our fona and cholula acquisitions as well as growth with our consumer packaged food customers or our at-home base. with strengthened base business as well as new product momentum, we continued to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products, not only with the combination of fona's flavor portfolio, but also with considerable growth from snack seasonings in the us and mexico as well as flavors from both savory and beverage applications. demand from our away from home customer base, the branded foodservice and restaurant customers declined and continue to be impacted by the covid-19 environment.
sales in our emea region were comparable to the first quarter of last year for flavor solutions, with demand declines in our away from home customer base, offset by strong sales for our consumer packaged food customers. this growth was driven by a significant increase in new product growth versus last year as well as continued strength in the base business, partially from our customers' promotional activities. our sales growth in the asia pacific region was outstanding, up 18% in constant currencies. both china, excluding the recovery impact from last year's lockdown, and australia delivered double-digit growth from quick service restaurants or qsr customers. this growth was driven by significant momentum in limited time offers as well as strength in the core business.
i mentioned our results related to cholula and fona. and now i'd like to provide a brief update on their integration status., for both acquisitions, our integration activities are progressing according to our plan. we continue to deliver on opportunities quickly and aggressively to drive growth and are pleased with our momentum on capturing our synergy opportunities. we remain on track to achieve synergies according to plan.
starting with cholula. as expected, our integration of the business has been straightforward. as of march 1, all functions have been integrated into our mccormick processes, and importantly, we are now servicing customers from our mccormick us distribution center. from a consumer commercial perspective, we are expanding distribution and are fueling growth, with robust brand marketing investments. we'll be activating both digital, where cholula was underpenetrated, and in-store merchandising in the next few weeks for our exciting cinco de mayo campaign. in flavor solutions, we're also expanding distribution with new and existing branded foodservice customers and are leveraging cholula's authentic mexican flavor for increased menu participation, particularly in cinco de mayo menu offers.
moving to fona. the employees of fona have been part of building a great business, and we are excited to be working with them to collectively integrate the business and drive plans to capitalize on growth opportunities. our functional integration is very much on track and is using a best of both approach to ensure we optimize our operating model, similar to the approach we have with our rb foods integration. the alignment of our organization is well under way, and we have had significant commercial collaboration yielding quick wins and identifying long-term strategic opportunities. customer reaction has been extremely positive. they were impressed with our early collaboration and excited about the increased customer value proposition created by the combination of mccormick and fona, a more comprehensive product offering, broader technical platform, deep technical and flavor talent and best-in-class customer collaborations. and we were excited with fona's performance starting the year, with great results and a robust momentum across the business.
for both cholula and fona, we are pleased with our progress so far and our contribution to our results. our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our acquisition plans, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only increased over the last few months.
now i would like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plans, starting on slide 10. local demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. we are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic, and our alignment, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. these underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plans position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
turning to slide 11. starting with our consumer segment, around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. across our apz region, consumer demand continues to be strong. in china, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which, in china, is in our consumer segment, with approximately 90% of restaurants open during the chinese new year period. in australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away from home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. and as i mentioned earlier, we are retaining households that came into our brands last year. and we're also realizing growth with our away from home customer.
in many of our largest markets in emea, restrictive covid-19 measures are still in place, further fueling at-home consumption, and we are seeing sustained levels of demand. in the americas, as restrictions are easing and vaccinations are continuing, consumption remains elevated. consumers are continuing to come to our brand, having a good experience and buying our products again. consumers are cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend which has accelerated during the pandemic. as we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data, supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience as it provides a creative outlook, reduces stress and connects the family. and consumers feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better tasting and cost less. in our recent consumer survey from february, these positive sentiments are not only still true but have strengthened.
consumers' interest in cooking has increased in recent months versus the end of last year because they want to cook versus have to cook. for example, approximately 50% of the consumers surveyed indicated they are cooking more now because they want to try new recipe, ingredient, cooking method or tool or simply just cook from scratch, and approximately 40% also indicated they're trying to recreate restaurant meals at home. importantly, over two-thirds of consumers surveyed claim they would maintain or increase their current level of cooking at home even if life were to return to normal next week, whatever normal may be.
we continue to believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond, fueled by robust brand marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. our category management initiatives are designed to continue to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both us and our customers. in the us, in 2020 we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration, transforming and at times confusing shelves with three shoppable sections. our rollout has continued in 2021, with plans to implement in thousands of stores, and the early indication is positive, with the category and mccormick branded growth outpacing the rest of the market in transformed stores.
we are also investing in e-commerce to drive mccormick and category growth. in the first quarter, we delivered over 90% global e-commerce growth, with particular strength in omnichannel. we are investing in content, retail research and innovation specifically for e-commerce, trialing new items of packaging in the direct-to-consumer channel first. for example, in the americas we've launched unique flavor inspiration products such as frank's redhot everything bagel seasonings, and in china we are launching a ready to eat chili paste on our direct to consumer platform. in emea, following the successful launch of the innovative street food seasonings the last year, we are now accelerating online growth with variety, bundle packs and multi-buy offers on our main e-commerce channels.
turning to global brand marketing. we continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio as evident in our 17% increase in the first quarter and plan for another significant increase in the second quarter. our investments have proven to be effective, and we will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into actions by targeting messaging focused on providing information and inspiration. we expect our brand marketing investments, combined with the valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.
highlighting some of our first quarter investments in the americas and emea regions on slide 12. starting with the americas. we continued our advertising campaign, it's gonna be great, with a focus on consumers' continuing traditions and preparing the families' signature holiday dishes even if their celebrations look different. our frank's super bowl campaign integrated across digital, social, online, video and tv featured fan favorite eli manning promoting frank's redhot as approachably hot and was our best super bowl campaign yet garnering record high impressions. as part of our zatarain's bold like that campaign, we partnered with new orleanian author and poet cleo wade to promote virtual mardi gras celebrations with authentic new orleans flavors, #zatarain'sporchparty, and recognizing virtual celebrations replace live mardi gras events, we supported culture aid nola, an organization which distributes food to hospitality workers impacted by pandemic restrictions.
turning to emea, where we have invested a substantial portion of our brands' marketing, our digital marketing and promotional activities included our holiday campaign featuring a festive gold cap limited edition packaging which drove strong holiday results in our major markets. in the uk, with our new year flavor resolutions campaign, we inspired consumers with recipes and products to flavor their healthy kick, whether it be through the heat of frank's or spicing it up through schwartz. and in france, we're giving families another reason to celebrate in 2021. in 2020, birthday celebrations were not just a piece of cake. so with the inspiration of our half-py birthday marketing campaign, consumers can celebrate their half birthdays, complete with vahine's launch of a decimal comma-shaped candle to top their cakes made with our vahine baking products.
looking at just a few of our second quarter plans, in the americas we'll inspire restaurant quality cooking with our it's gonna be great campaign. our vahine brand in emea is sponsoring a prime-time french baking program which will showcase our homemade dessert line. in both regions, we launched easter campaigns, bringing the family together with baking and crafting ideas. and moving to grilling season, we will acknowledge the importance of connecting through outdoor grilling occasions through campaigns targeting products such as french's and grill mates in the us and frank's in the uk. finally, our plans include support of our robust new product launches. new products are integral to our growth. in our consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. our 2020 launches have made exceptional trials and are providing significant momentum into this year. and in 2021, we have a robust global pipeline of new product launches, and i'm happy to share some of our first half launches as seen on slide 13.
we're meeting consumers at the intersection of flavor and health. we're launching just 5 dry recipe mixes in the us, dips and dressing mixes in flavors like french onions and homestyle ranch, the clean and short ingredient statements, five simple ingredients delivering a classic flavor experience. and in france, we are expanding our range of organic products in our vahine homemade dessert line.
when it comes to heat, we're continuing to broaden our french portfolio globally. in the us, we're expanding french green sauces, with a milder tangy buffalo flavor and a garlic buffalo flavor or combining savory garlic with spicy eats. also in the us, we have just launched cholula wing sauces in two flavors: mexicali cilantro lime and caliente spicy arbol peppers in a unique bottle with the iconic wooden cap. and in the uk, we're launching frank's craft additions, capitalizing on interest in frank's heat with differentiated flavors such as roasted jalapeno and raw [phonetic] habanero.
we are responding to consumers' demand for convenience and flavor. in the us, our launch of frozen appetizers, providing hot chicken bites and buffalo chicken dips with frank's flavor that are ready in minutes is gaining momentum with one of our best new product starts. we're excited at the launch of new grill mates all-purpose grilling seasonings for consumers who want to respect the need. simple course ground seasonings for the open flame that cling to the meat and lock in juiciness.
finally, our innovation is not only all about flavor but also staying relevant with our consumers through our packaging innovation. we're continuing the rollout of our first choice bottle with its consumer preferred transparent and functional design, modern look and a reinforcement of fresh flavor into our eastern european markets. these markets have predominantly been sachet markets for spices and seasonings and perceive the bottle packaging as a premium offering. and in canada, we're beginning the relaunch of our gourmet line in the first choice bottle as well as adding new flavor varieties. in the uk, not only are we building on our schwartz recipe mix momentum with the introduction of flavorful line extensions. we're also advancing on our sustainable packaging commitment with sachet packaging that is 100% recyclable. schwartz will be the first brand in the uk dry recipe mix category with recyclable packaging. and in france, with the redesign of our ducros grinder. its appearance not only has greater consumer appeal, but it also reduces our carbon footprint.
turning to flavor solutions. in this segment, we have a diverse customer base, and have seen various stages of recovery. from a food at home perspective, our flavor solutions' growth varies by packaged food customer. overall, we are carrying our growth momentum with these customers into 2021, driven by strength in their iconic core products as well as new products and bigger-bet innovation in 2021. overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovations from these customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on shelf. there are still new product launches, and in many cases they are smaller expansions of the core and more channel oriented.
moving into 2021, we're excited about the momentum of the 2020 launches, but even more excited about the robust 2021 pipeline. our customers have bigger bet innovations in their plans. i would look forward to collaborating with them and driving growth from those launches. the key enablers driving our success and developing winning flavors for our customers is our insight on consumer and culinary trends. we've been at the forefront forecasting emerging flavors for 21 years. through the mccormick flavor forecasts, we have a history of identifying the top trends in ingredients, catering to future of flavor, many of which have stood the test of time, whether it was ma turmeric or pumpkin pie spices, the flavor of chipotle or dishes with [indecipherable]. in april, we'll be launching our newest addition that will shake up the way we cook, flavor and eat. we'll feature new trends, flavors and recipes that will not only flavor our consumer segment innovation, but also drive wins with our flavor solutions' customer. in our away from home portion of this segment, as i mentioned earlier, we are seeing growth from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in our apz region as restrictions have eased. the qsr demand momentum continues to strengthen, particularly as they continue to expand their menu options with limited time offers and are increasing promotional activities.
branded foodservice demand as it relates to entertainment, stadium for hospitality venues, for instance, is recovering at a slower pace. in emea and the americas, during the first quarter our restaurants and other foodservice customers were still impacted by government imposed covid-19 restrictions in many markets. there is now optimism with many of these customers related to restrictions' easing and reopening plans. focus has shifted from adapting operating model to the supply chain preparedness for the second half of the year. we're collaborating with our customers to ensure a strong recovery with pent-up demand being met. we expect the recovery of some of our branded food customers will start to begin, similar to what we've seen in apz. as qsr customers are oriented less to dine-in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. we have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum.
across our entire flavor solutions portfolio, we were advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. with our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and, importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships. when we collaborate with our customers and our technical innovation center, we have a high win rate. since we could not connect in person during 2020, we adapted to new ways of collaborating through creative, digital and virtual solutions. the interactive experience for our customers build their excitement, awareness and confidence in our unique capabilities in an engaging and inspiring way.
we continue to not only strengthen our engagement in 2020, but we also proved we could maintain a high win rate whether physically in our innovation centers or not, and have carried that momentum into 2021. in our flavor solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. the top-line opportunities gained from our investments to expand flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our fona acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
lastly, we continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet, our purpose-led performance. following being named by corporate knights in their 2021 global 100 most sustainable corporations index as number one in the packaged food and processed foods and ingredients sector, mccormick was also recently named to barron's 2021 100 most sustainable companies list for the fourth consecutive year. as we continue our sustainability journey, i'm excited to announce that later this week we will begin using 100% renewable electricity in all our maryland and new jersey-based facilities. this includes our manufacturing operations, distribution centers, offices and technical innovation center and will result in an 11% reduction in our global greenhouse gas emissions.
moving to slide 16. in summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our consumer segment and with our flavor solutions' at home customers, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the flavor solutions away from home recovery and are excited about our cholula and fona acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum and the breadth and reach of our portfolio reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary covid-19 costs and our business transformation investments which highlights our focus on profit realization. our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we're positioned for continued success. importantly, mccormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success, and i would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement.
now i'll turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone.
i'll now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. as lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding.
starting with our top line growth. as seen on slide 18, we grew sales 20% in constant currency during the first quarter. our volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributed to the increase. our organic sales growth was 16%, driven by our consumer segment, and incremental sales from our cholula and fona acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. the consumer segment sales grew 32% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in all three regions. the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our consumer product, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives and resulted in higher volume and mix in each region.
on slide 19, consumer segment sales in the americas increased 30% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2020, with 5% of the increase from the acquisition of cholula. the remaining increase from higher volume and product mix was broad based across majority of categories and brands as well as private label products, with particular strength in the mccormick, frank's redhot, french's, zatarain's, lawry's, simply asia and gourmet garden brands.
in emea, constant currency consumer sales grew 26% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in all countries and categories across the region. the most significant volume and mix growth drivers were schwartz and ducros branded spices and seasonings. vahine homemade dessert products, packing products and our kamis branded products in poland. consumer sales in the asia pacific region increased 55% in constant currency, driven primarily by the recovery from the disruption in china consumption last year, as lawrence mentioned. excluding that recovery impact, the region had double-digit growth due to strong china consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially driven by the timing of chinese new year and related holiday promotions as well as continued strength in australia.
turning to our flavor solutions segment on slide 22. we grew first quarter constant currency sales 3%. in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 2%, driven by the fona and cholula acquisitions, a 7% increase, as well as pricing to offset cost increases. volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies, with particular strength in snack seasonings and savory flavors.
in emea, constant currency sales were comparable to last year as pricing actions offset cost increases. volume and product mix declined due to lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies, with strength in snack seasonings. in the asia pacific region, flavor solutions sales rose 18% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to qsrs in china and australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as the china recovery impact from last year's covid-19 related lockdown. as seen on slide 26, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the cholula and fona acquisitions as well as special charges, increased 35% or, in constant currency, 32%, in the first quarter versus the year ago period.
the consumer segment adjusted operating income grew 59% to $190 million. the 54% constant currency growth from higher sales, favorable mix and cci-led cost savings more than offset covid-19 related costs and a 17% increase in brand marketing. in the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 4% to $73 million with minimal impact from currency. higher sales and cci-led cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs.
as seen on slide 27, adjusted gross profit margin expanded 60 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period due to favorable mix, both within the consumer segment and due to the sales shift between segments. in addition, cci-led cost savings were partially offset by covid-19 related costs. our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year. leverage from sales growth drove the decline, partially offset by the increase in brand marketing i mentioned a moment ago. with the gross margin expansion and sg&a leverage, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2020.
turning to income taxes on slide 28. our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 18.4% in the year ago period. the first quarter adjusted tax rate in 2020 was significantly impacted by a favorable discrete item related to a refinement of our entity structure. income from unconsolidated operations increased 28% in the first quarter of 2021 due to strong underlying performance of our joint venture in mexico.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide 30, first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share were $0.72 as compared to $0.54 for the year-ago period. the increase was due to our higher adjusted operating income performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate.
on slide 31, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. our cash flow from operations was an outflow of $32 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to an inflow of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. this change was primarily due to a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. in february, we raised $1 billion through the issuance of five year 0.9% notes and 10 year 1.85% notes. we took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following our cholula and fona acquisitions. we also returned $91 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $49 million for capital expenditures this quarter. we expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow, driven by profit and working capital initiatives, and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash: funding investments to fuel growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
now i would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on slides 32 and 33. with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. in our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid-19 costs and erp investments as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. we also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.
at the top line, due to our first quarter results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 6% to 8% compared to 5% to 7% previously, which continues to include the incremental impact of the cholula and fona acquisitions at the projected range of 3.5% to 4%. we anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. as lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the covid-19 recovery, but importantly, we continue to expect we will drive overall organic sales growth with the full year in both of our segments.
we're now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be comparable to 2020 due to increasing inflationary pressure, mainly due to transportation costs. but our inflation expectation for the full year remains a low single-digit increase. our adjusted gross margin projection reflects margin accretion from the cholula and fona acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix in both segments and covid-19 costs. our estimate for covid-19 costs remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. as a reminder, fiscal 2021's covid-19 costs are largely from third-party manufacturing costs. reflecting the increase in our sales outlook, we are also increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth.
our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 11% to 13% constant currency growth compared to 10% to 12% previously. this is partially offset by a 1% impact from increased covid-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% impact of the estimated incremental erp investment. this results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 7% to 9% in constant currency, increase from 6% to 8% previously. this projection reflects the inflationary pressure i just mentioned as well as our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. we also continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in first half of the year.
we also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. this outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 4%.
we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a favorable impact from currency. this increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long-term financing, which i mentioned earlier. our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02 compared to $2.91 to $2.96 previously. this compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. this growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 11% to 13% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts i just mentioned related to covid-19 costs, our incremental erp investments and the tax headwind. based on the expected timing of some expense items such as covid-19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year.
our first quarter performance was a strong start to the year, and we are optimistic for the balance of the year, though we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020 while also making investments to drive growth in 2021.
in summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid-19 costs, the erp investments as well as a higher projected effective tax rate.
i'd like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike.
now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i would like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on slide 34. our first quarter results, with double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth bode an outstanding start to the year and bolster our confidence in a stronger 2021 outlook. we have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. we are confident the sustainability of higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and we are well positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends as well as prepared for away from home consumption recovery. cholula and fona have both started the year with strong momentum in results. our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our plan has only strengthened over the last few months. our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. we are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond.
now let's turn to your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your questions.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning, everybody.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, andrew.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi there. i guess, first off, sounds like you are making, as expected, good progress on getting many of those suspended items and skus back on the shelf as your capacity comes on stream. it sounds like there is still some more to go as you move through the year, i guess particularly in 2q. is there any way you can maybe dimensionalize that a bit on how significant that refill might be in 2q, even if it's like versus the magnitude of what you saw in 1q, just to try and put some context around it? and have you had any challenges in getting some of those suspended items back on the shelf at all? because i know that in europe you mentioned you had actually benefited from incremental shelf placement at the expense of some competitors that had some capacity issues. i didn't know if the reverse had been an issue for you here. and then i've just got a follow-up.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, andrew. well, as we've gone through the covid crisis in 2020, we undershipped consumption every quarter because we were not able to keep up with the extended elevated levels demand overall, and in order to keep our best selling items or core items and in particular as we got to the holiday items we did suspend a substantial number of items. and as we've added capacity, we've been steadily restoring them as we've gone through this -- this first quarter of this year. and i'd say that right now, we probably are around the halfway point in terms of getting items back on the shelf. but you or anyone on this call and certainly my friends and family who hecker me about this endlessly can walk into any store and find that there are a lot of holes on the shelf and a lot of our products that are not yet in full distribution and even within a given account the store by store situation, it might be different. there is a -- there is a supply chain aspect to it, there is a retail work aspect to getting on the shelf. and i think that this is going to be a steady rebuild as we go through the rest of the year. we've made a good start on it in q1, but we have quite a long way to go. and i would hesitate to get overly precise about it. i would expect to see the shelf getting restored as we go through the year.
i think one of the big variables for us, andrew, is just the strength of the consumer demand. consumer demand has been higher than we originally planned. so we're actually not as far along in our restoration plans as we would have hoped. that's because as fast as we supply the market, consumers are pulling the product through. but i do think that it's hard -- i'd say it's hard for us to dimensionalize. i will emphasize it's an americas problem. most of the world we are shipping to, consumption in our supply chain is well caught up or service levels are solid. it's in the americas where we've got some catching up to do. and in most categories here in the americas, we're also shipping to consumption as well. it's primarily herbs and spices and our recipe mixes, particularly. i think you're going to see a big change in the tdp as we go through the coming weeks. and i think -- i'm sure we've hit bottom on that and have already turned the quarter just because of the restoration efforts there.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think i'll just add to that too. we're being a little bit -- we're optimistic but prudent. i mean, the second quarter of last year, as you remember, we grew total consumer sales 28%; 36% in the americas. so it's a tough comp as we look forward, but we're optimistic.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
okay. understood. and thank you for the tdp comment. that leads into just a quick follow-up, which is, where do you -- what's your best guess at where tdps might end up like once we get to a steady state, let's say, versus 2019. i'm assuming they will be down a bit just as you have come through this and maybe in a more efficient shelf going forward even though i know they probably reached obviously more depth during the actual pandemic and then as you recover. but would you expect tdps to be down maybe a couple of percent going forward as sort of steady state...
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, that's a very astute observation. as we've gone through this, we've not only suspended skus, but we've also rationalized skus and we've eliminated a couple of hundred skus that were slower moving. the items that we have now are much higher velocity on average. we're also continuing the aisle reinvention program and setting store shelves. in spite of the covid situation last year and all of the restrictions ramp working itself, we were able to reset over 5,000 stores. we expect at least that many this year. and we're definitely getting a lift from that, and at the same time, it does reduce the sku count, so it's an efficient set.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much, everybody.

our next question is from the line of ken goldman with jpmorgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. you have a unique perspective because you see broadly across so many retail and foodservice categories. i'm curious, in the us, restaurant sales, they're doing better, right. americans are traveling much more. but at the same time, we're seeing overall food at home takeaway really remains strong and i think probably better than what some may have expected. obviously down on a weekly basis, but still better on a two-year. so i'm just curious, are you surprised and how do you reconcile the improved foodservice sales that we're seeing across the entire industry with what i would consider still impressive at home trends? i never want to bet against the simplest explanation which is that americans are just eating more. but i think the total implied increase in food numbers is notable. i'm just curious for your thoughts there.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
great. hey, ken, thanks. and by the way, you won the award for the best headline on your screen. that was awesome.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
all the shorts are mad at me for overstating it. so it works both ways.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. well, i would tell first of all, the food-at-home consumption really is strong. i mean, we're seeing that ourselves in our business, of course, and also in our flavor solutions business where other cpg companies are our customers and we see -- we're seeing a lot of strength there. i think on restaurant, it's actually a mixed bag. the quick service restaurants are doing well. i think during the first quarter, there were a lot of -- because everyone thinks about the state we're in today, but think about december and january. there were a lot of new lockdowns that were put in place, restrictions that had been lifted were reinstated. so i'd say that the branded foodservice side that of the restaurant customers might be off to a little bit slower start to the year than everyone maybe thinking. i do think there is a lot of optimism among restaurant operators as we go into -- into second quarter and as the vaccination rates go up and many of these restrictions are lifted. and i think that that group will come back -- come back stronger. but certainly for the beginning of the year, they're off to a little bit slower start.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thank you. and i know we're running a little long but i wanted to sneak one more in, which is, it's always dangerous to ask about math on earnings calls but back of the envelope, it seems you're implying now that for the last nine months of the year, right, 2q through 4q, organic sales growth is actually going to be a little bit less than what you anticipated a few months ago, and i'm just basing this on some of your guidance items. so is it fair to say that the first quarter overshipment was so strong that it maybe pulled forward some of your expected shipments ahead or am i really parsing that info too finely and you're not really making any implied changes to that?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i know. it's our intent was to reflect the sales growth overdelivery that we got in the first quarter but which was -- which was high. but we really did not change our outlook for the rest of the year...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
year to go, for the total constant organic as we call it is basically the same, plus or minus 1% for the year. so we caught our base off the range of 2.5% to 4%, up 1%. but you're right, year-to-go is basically what we've said before. we haven't called it down. i know and as you and others -- the two-year cagr was really an impressive part that as we start measuring that i'm looking at lapping things. so those are actually above our organic growth guidance long-term that we're seeing now.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and it is during the first quarter. so we're trying to be both -- express our optimism because, i mean, the business is very strong, but also be a bit prudent...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're lapping a big second quarter.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we're lapping a big second quarter.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst

our next question is from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
all right. thank you.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi robert.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. i don't think you are in the practice of giving us your covid costs, but i was wondering if they now need to be higher this year than expected because you need to rely on third parties more than you thought. and if you can maybe compare that to 2020. i'm also wondering if i could look at second quarter in a different way. i know the year-over-year is difficult to look at, but sequentially you typically have higher sales in 2q than you have in 1q and higher first -- and higher profit, but i think consensus is assuming that that won't happen. so, i know you've given us first half, second half guidance, but i'm wondering for a little more clarity on how 2q compares to 1q maybe sequentially. thanks.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, this is mike. on the covid cost, we said previously, and we haven't changed from that -- we spent about $50 million last year, and we're going to spend about $60 million this year, so up about $10 million. now, the timing of that's a little different. it's going to be first half heavily weighted in 2021. a lot of that's the co-man costs we called out before. kind of leading to your second question. co-man was coming in the first quarter wasn't a full impact of the co-man costs as we ramped things up. so really the second quarter is where kind of every month, we'll have the full co-man costs. that's a little bit of the headwind in the second quarter. we talked about the first quarter, our consumer a&p was up around 17%. we're going to have another investment of a&p in the second quarter to drive sales as we said to -- again, that's part of the first half-second half story. so i think q2 has a bit of a headwind from an expense perspective in a covid and a&p cost perspective. and also the tax rates, they're going down to the eps line.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. i'll leave it there. thank you very much.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd say, maybe to summarize this. we've talked about the year being a first half-second half story. within the first half, there was a first quarter and a second quarter story, think of it that way.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. and again first half eps still up versus year ago?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.

next question is from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your question.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, alexia.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
hi there. so you mentioned commerce briefly in the prepared remarks. could you give us a little bit more color region by region? you talked about strong double-digit growth, and i'm just wondering how that varies in the various parts of the world. and are you seeing a slowdown in some of those areas at this point as the reopening happens? and then i have a follow-up.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. well, first of all, e-commerce is strong everywhere. we talked last year about triple digits, and at the end of the year we said e-commerce total was around -- i think it was 136% increase year-on-year. it's not quite triple-digit but it's -- but it's a very strong double digit increase in the first quarter, again, on top of the strong performance last year. so, i mean, i'd say that that's still pretty explosive growth and we have no disappointment about that. i'd say the omnichannel particularly is very strong. and i don't -- i think that while the numbers may be slightly different region to region, but the trend is the same direction globally.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think consumers have had a good experience shopping online.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think as a habit, they're going to continue using [indecipherable] according to some of our consumer research.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and then in terms of new product launches, it sounds as though you've obviously got an impressive lineup for 2021. is your percentage of sales from new products trending upwards? i imagine it was slower last year because of the pandemic. i don't know whether you can quantify exactly what percentage of sales from new products you're anticipating this year and how that compares to maybe where you were a year ago.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'll let mike speak to the numbers if...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think it's a more -- think of it as a more normal year. and in a normal year, we're talking about 7% or 8% of our products introduced in the last three years to make up our sales base. it would have been less last year because of the pandemic, but kind of the strong ramp of new products into 2021, as you've seen that we get back to more than normal longer-term numbers.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
a number of the items that we launched last year we got -- we got less placement on it because of the focus on core items, not just by us but by the retailers. on the other hand, where we did get into distribution, they got an extraordinary amount of trial. so some of the items that we did launch last year are our best performing new items in a while. and we're really treating 2021 as a continuation of the launch year for the [indecipherable] introduced last year. so it gives us quite a pipeline for this year.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

our next question is from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi, adam.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so i just wanted -- two clarification questions. first, relative to the earnings call in january, the expectations on raw materials and cost inflation were unchanged. just to be clear just in terms of what you're seeing in terms of freight, packaging, variety of raw material ingredients. is that something where you've had enough contracted and not exposed to the spot market to insulate you for fiscal '21 or is it just year-over-year aggregate commodity basket really hasn't moved that much because more broadly, it seems...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. this is mike. i mean, we haven't changed our guidance for the year. so low single digits. obviously, a lot of commodities in packaging, to your point, is already contracted. and freight is a variable that we've talked about, and one of the reasons we said while we've had really great growth in mix and things like that and the long-term debt optimization, we didn't drop it off through to the bottom line because some pressure from increased inflation for transportation, just like every other company has been seeing recently. and we recognize that in our forecast and our guidance. but we are still low single digits generally.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. that's really helpful. and then the second clarification, just, you talked about overshipping america's consumption growth of 15%, and i'm just trying to make sure in the slides, the americas volume price mix, or product mix is up 25% -- 24.5%. is that apples to apples versus the 15% or what's the -- just trying to understand the magnitude of how much you were actually overshipping in the period.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
in the year ago -- this is lawrence -- in the year ago, in the first quarter of last year, it still seems like a long -- a lifetime ago, in the americas, actually undershipped consumption in the first quarter a year ago. and so, at the time we said that about 4% impact on the americas. and so i think you should factor that out. and so the overshipments versus consumption might be a little bit less than it kind of seems. again, we hope actually to build -- rebuild stocks in the trade more than we did, and the consumption was very strong.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. that's all. that's all really helpful. i'll pass it on. thank you.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you.

we're nearing the end of our question-and-answer session for today and have time for one additional question, which is coming from the line of chris growe with stifel. please proceed with your questions.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi, good morning.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, chris.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi. i just -- i'll make it quick here. i know we're at the end of this. real quickly, just to understand, as we think about those third-party co-manufacturing costs and a bit of weight on the gross margin, do those continue all through the year? just to understand, like are you using third parties just to rebuild inventory and then you kind of shut that down or is this something that will be ongoing in terms of your sort of supply of product in the future?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, chris, it's mike. one, we're always using co-manufacturers. that's a part of our supply chain. as we've talked about, here we've really stretched some of those strategic co-packers that help us out shorter-term, really focused on the first six months of the year, very volume-dependent. so the way we're thinking now is, again, the second quarter will be the heavier spend. there'll be some probably growth in the third quarter or so, but, and we'll see what volume is too, what consumption continues. that's something we would assess, as we always do. and as our supply chain continues to recover, so that's another variable that could speed it up or slow it down. so those are all considered in our guidance stuff.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. thank you. and just a quick one on -- as i think about what's happening in china, you saw double-digit consumption in consumer sales and i think that even excludes the branded foodservice who sells the products you sell as well as a really strong recovery in foodservice. i guess i just want to understand, make sure those numbers are accurate. and then to the degree to which that is somewhat of a predictor of what can happen in the us as we sort of lap the tougher comps on the consumer side with the easy comes in the foodservice side. are you learning anything from what's happened in china as an indicator for the us?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i think the interesting thing in china is that even though they are well past that the covid impact and are very far along in recovery, consumption of food at home remains strong even as foodservice has recovered. i think it's interesting to look around that region also because what we're talking about is the asia-pacific region. it's not just china. that's the biggest market there. but markets like australia, which is also pretty far along in recovery. even though foodservice has rebounded, it's not back to the same level that it once was. and consumption of food at home has continued to be very strong.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it goes to the point we have been making which is that this has been a long-term trend anyway for consumers. once you cooked more at home and more from scratch [indecipherable] they do, and the covid situation reinforced that behavior. it's helped a whole new generation of cooks learn how to cook their family recipes that maybe they relied on mom or grandma or new eating occasions...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
like lunch.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
whole new eating occasions like launch as people work remotely. i think there are a lot of reasons to believe that consumption at home is going to continue to be elevated.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst

lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kasey. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth performance and people strategies, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning mccormick to emerge stronger from the crisis. we continue to execute from a position of strength with the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made and capabilities we've built as an organization. our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on and the effective execution of those strategies as well as our recent acquisitions of two fantastic businesses, and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year.
our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflect our robust growth momentum on a two year basis, as seen on slide 4. we delivered significant double-digit two year growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins. even considering increased covid-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments, we are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategy, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities. we are emerging stronger.
as we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. as seen on slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. the breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings, creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced again by our second quarter results.
during last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers' cooking and eating more at-home, at-home consumption, resulting in a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food customer -- food company customers in our flavor solutions segment. last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio. our second quarter results reflect the lapping of these year ago comparisons as well as the sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels and the robust recovery from away -from -home customers.
our second quarter results also included strong contributions from our cholula and fona acquisitions, which further extended the breadth and reach of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers. taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident in our balanced portfolio that will continue to differentiate mccormick and sustainably position us for growth.
now let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results. turning to slide 6. total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year ago period and constant currency sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our flavor solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our consumer segment, both impacted by the factors i've mentioned a few moments ago. the considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income decline of 1% or 4% in constant currency. at the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 in the year ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate.
as we stated in our march earnings call, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of covid-19 recovery. importantly though, we started the first half of the year with outstanding performance. year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income 16% and 14% year-over-year respectively, both of which include 3% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share 10%.
while mike will provide more details in a few moments, i'd like to comment on our outlook. with our first half results and our robust operating momentum, we are increasing our 2021 outlook for sale, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. we are operating in the dynamic cost environment and we're certainly not unique in experiencing cost pressures. we're seeing broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs.
to offset rising costs, we are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there are the lag times associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. therefore, most of our actions won't go into effect until late 2021. as pricing discussions are ongoing, we can't provide further specifics. we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary period with the combination of pricing and cost savings.
now let's turn to our second quarter segment business performance, which will include comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as we believe these to be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year ago period.
starting on slide 7, with our consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by 2% or in constant currency, 5%. our consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two year basis was up double-digits, highlighting how sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products, and importantly, outpaces pre-pandemic levels.
our americas constant currency sales declined 7% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. our total mccormick u.s. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, declined 26%, following a 55% consumption increase in the second quarter of 2020.
the difference between year-over-year shipment and consumption changes is attributable to two factors. first, we under-shipped consumption in the second quarter of last year. second, we continue to replenish retailer and consumer pantry inventories that were completed throughout last year, demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our u.s. manufacturing capacity expansion.
throughout our first half of the year, we restored products which had been suspended at the end of last year and continue to see service levels improve, and we are refilling the inventory pipeline. as we have said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. through working with our customers on improving shelf conditions, we estimate approximately 90% of suspended products are now back on shelf.
we know the categories most impacted by supply constraints, spices and seasonings and dry recipe mix, there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. products that had strong supply and remained on shelf performed well. and as suspended products are restocked on shelf, we are seeing improved performance. this improvement is somewhat masked due to the lapping of significant overall share gains in the second quarter of last year. importantly, we continue to anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve.
focusing further on our u.s. branded portfolio, our iri consumption data, combined with unmeasured channels, indicates consumption of the portfolio grew 18% versus the second quarter of 2019 led by significant growth in spices and seasonings and hot sauces, and also includes triple-digit pure-play growth in e-commerce with mccormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories. this is the third consecutive quarter our u.s. branded portfolio consumption grew double-digits in the mid -to-high-teens versus the two year ago period, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our categories. our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the mccormick brand, but smaller brands as well. household penetration and repeat buyer rates have also growth versus 2019. and when our consumers shop, they are buying more of our products than they were pre-pandemic.
and finally, for the americas, our initiative to reinvent the in-store experiences for spices and seasonings consumers with new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration is yielding great early results. where implemented, the category and mccormick-branded growth is outpacing the rest of market as we plan to implement this in thousands of additional stores in the third quarter.
now turning to emea, which has continued its outstanding momentum. we had strong market share performance in the second quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share in our core brands and markets following the strong gains in the second quarter last year. notably, both schwartz and ducros spices and seasonings as well as frank's redhot grew consumption during the second quarter against a strong comparison to double-digit growth last year. and not only are we retaining new households we gained last year, but we are also continuing to increase household penetration for the fifth consecutive quarter.
our investments in brand marketing in the emea, which significantly increased in the second quarter compared to last year, are proven to be effective as evidenced by the metrics i just discussed as well as are achieving above benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click there for instance in our digital marketing. additionally, the creativity of our vahine half-py birthday campaign received national media attention in france as well as the prestigious award for its excellence in advertising the design.
on a two year basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019, we drove double-digit consumption growth and market share gains in our core categories and markets, including total emea region spices and seasonings, vahine homemade desserts, france, and both schwartz recipe mixes and frank's redhot in the u.k. since the beginning of the pandemic, our emea supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region.
in the asia pacific region, second quarter sales growth was strong. during this time last year, china's hubei province, where our wuhan operations are located, remains in lockdown in part of the second quarter. and our results reflect the recovery from that as well as the recovery of branded foodservice sales in china. china's foodservice has almost fully returned to pre-pandemic levels with restaurant home delivery increasing at popularity. our consumer product demand declined due to lapping significant growth last year.
in australia, we continue to see elevated consumption and share gains versus the second quarter of 2019 with frank's redhot and stubb's consumption growing triple-digits and gaining share. the gourmet garden, mccormick and keen's spice and seasonings outpacing the categories with double-digit consumption growth.
across all our regions, our new products continue to be integral to our growth, and we're gaining significant momentum with our recent launches. for instance, our grill mates all-purpose seasoning and our frank's frozen appetizers are driving growth in the americas as consumers have shifted their thinking about convenience from no cooking to cooking easily. and in emea, the rollout of our first choice glass bottle into the eastern european market is going very well, increasing our relevance with consumers and driving share gains, as they perceive the glass bottle as a premium to sachet.
moving forward, while we know we will be lapping challenging year-over-year consumption comparisons in the second half of the year, we are confident that we continue to capture the momentum in our consumer segment. we have more consumers than pre-pandemic. they have come into our brands, are having a good experience and are buying our products again. we are excited about our growth trajectory and expect continued and long-lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, new product and category management initiatives as well as growth from our cholula acquisition.
turning to slide 8. our flavor solutions second quarter results include not only recovering from the significant curtailment of away-from-home dining during last year's second quarter, but also the growth momentum we are gaining with our restaurant and other foodservice customers as well as the continued strong momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. in the second quarter, our sales rose 39% or 34% at constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions. and on a two year basis, our sales also increased double -digits in all three regions.
in the americas, our fona and cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant growth in the second quarter, and we are executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. we continue to see strong growth in our consumer packaged food customers, while executing on our portfolio migration through new products and base business strength.
compared to last year's second quarter, snack seasonings grew double-digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products, and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. consumers' rising global demand for hot spicy flavors is driving growth for our customer snacks and for our seasonings that flavor them. and with the flavor hard seltzer trend accelerating, we are winning new business and growing our flavor sales for beverages considerably, up triple-digits in the second quarter.
demand from our americas away-from-home customer base or branded foodservice and restaurant customers increased significantly due to the recovery i mentioned a few moments ago. our away-from-home rebound in this region is at a slower pace as our customer base is more skewed to branded foodservice. we anticipate our demand from this channel will strengthen as the year progresses and more dining options reopen.
in emea, as we cycle the significant decline in last year's second quarter from regionwide shutdowns, our growth was substantial. our sales to quick-service restaurants or qsrs more than doubled from the second quarter of last year and increased double-digits from the same period in 2019 with particular strength in the u.k.
turning to our consumer packaged food and beverage customers. we had strong second quarter performance on top of last year's strong growth. the growth in flavors for sweet beverages and the hot and spicy trend fueling both base and new product growth in snack seasonings. our sales growth in the asia pacific region was partially due to the recovery from lockdowns, closures and curfews in countries outside of china during the second quarter of last year as well as continued momentum in australia from qsr customers' limited time offer. additionally, china, where qsrs were open in the second quarter of last year, delivered double-digit growth due to significant momentum and limited time offers as well as strength in the core business.
across all regions, we recognize a large part of our second quarter flavor solutions results were due to the comparison to abnormally low away-from-home demand last year. importantly though, our growth also includes contributions for fona and cholula, strong growth with packaged food and beverage customers both in the base business and the new product wins, driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with qsrs, partially from their limited time offers and promotional activity. while we know a portion of our second half growth will still be impacted by recovery, our second quarter results and our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence in returning to our robust pre-pandemic growth trajectory in our flavor solutions segment.
now for a brief update on how we're driving growth with cholula and fona, starting with cholula on slide 9. in our consumer segment, cholula continues to outpace category growth and gained share, growing consumption 54% since the second quarter of 2019. we're using our category management expertise to expand distribution points, including with the two ounce bottle size and expansion into new channels, optimize shelf assortment and placement and gain momentum in e-commerce where cholula has been underpenetrated.
we are increasing awareness through brand partnerships such as with hellofresh and doordash as well as through brand marketing investments and by leveraging promotional scale across mccormick brand, including cholula's best ever cinco de mayo promotion with double the merchandising as 2019 and scale with mccormick's taco seasoning. our initiatives are yielding results. we have grown total distribution points 11% and household penetration 5% since the second quarter of 2020. we recently launched cholula wing sauces and also relaunched the green pepper in chipotle flavors with cleaner formulas.
and in our flavor solutions segment, we're using our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends to grow our back of house foodservice penetration by increasing cholula's menu participation. since the beginning of the year, we've driven a 63% increase in u.s. national chain restaurant locations, activating a cholula-branded limited time offer. we are winning in foodservice.
now moving to fona, we are excited by year-to-date double-digit sales growth compared to last year. beverages with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category continue to drive significant growth for fona, 14% on a year-to-date basis. we're driving growth with our global footprint. for example, by leveraging giotti's infrastructure, we are expanding flavors for top fona customer into the emea region, with the first order being manufactured this month. we are also leveraging mccormick's sustainability leadership to create new opportunities with fona customers.
combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to bid on customer breeds that capitalize on core strengths across mccormick and fona, including mccormick's culinary focus and fona's speed to market. fona's year-to-date new product wins and its pipeline potential has hit record highs fueling future growth. we have also identified longer term opportunities to optimize our combined assets and technologies across the network to expand our capacity and drive further solutions for our customers.
customer reaction has been extremely positive. they are impressed with our early collaboration, and excitement about our increased customer value proposition continues to build. our enthusiasm for cholula and fona and our confidence will deliver on our acquisition plans, accelerate growth with these portfolios and drive shareholder value continues to strengthen. in fact, we're now projecting the incremental sales contribution of these acquisitions to be at the high end of our 3.5% to 4% guidance range.
now i'd like to share some of our insight of long-term consumer trends. as seen on slides 11 and 12, global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. we are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as they have been in the past with the younger generations continuing to fuel the demand for flavor at a greater rate.
as we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data, supported by external research, tells us that consumers are enjoying the cooking experience. it provides a creative outlet, makes them feel adventurous, reduces stress and connects the family, and they feel home-cooked meals are healthier. in our recent consumer survey from may, 68% of u.s. consumer survey state they are cooking more today than pre-pandemic and 78% claims they would maintain or increase their level of cooking at home as things return to normal next week with no meaningful difference between those vaccinated and those not. research indicates a continued increased level of cooking in other countries as well.
consumers have formed new habit. they invested in new kitchen appliances and want to try new things. they want to cook versus have to cook with the majority of food from restaurants being consumed at home and over 70% of u.s. consumers are adding their own spices, seasonings and condiments to further flavor their takeaway or deliver food, channels have become orders and lunch is the new meal to prepare at home with hybrid workplace models more common post-pandemic, allowing employees to split time between the office and home. research indicates, at-home lunch occasions increasing up 30%. we believe consumer behavior and sentiment driving accelerated and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic. and combined with the effective execution of our growth strategies, will further drive consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond.
moving to slide 13. we are making transformative investments which will enable us to sustainably meet increasing demand both for our products and our customers' product. we are investing in our supply chain to expand our capacity and capabilities as well as increase our resiliency. for example, we are increasing our condiment and seasoning capacity. we plan to optimize our distribution network for the new northeast u.s. distribution center, our largest in the world. and we are in the final stages of building a new u.k. flavor solutions manufacturing facility, which is on track to become mccormick's first net zero carbon building. these investments will enable us to remain agile and scalable and deliver the future growth that we expect.
now for some summary comments. first, i'm pleased to share an important milestone for mccormick. with our overarching focus on growth and successful execution of our strategy, we have consistently driven industry-leading revenue growth, resulting in mccormick being named to the latest fortune 500 list of companies by fortune magazine. we are proud of our sustained performance and being included on this prestigious list. we take pride in delivering our industry-leading financial performance of doing the right thing with responsibility for the long-term vitality of people, communities and the planet we share. in may, we were named the diversity inc. top 50 company for the fifth consecutive year. this recognition is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally as well as our broader esg efforts.
in summary, our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook continue to be stronger than ever. our alignment with long-term consumer trends, the breadth and reach of our portfolio and a robust operating momentum combined with the successful execution of our strategy, bolsters our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary covid-19 costs and our business transformation investments. our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we are sustainably positioned for growth.
i would like to recognize and thank mccormick employees around the world for their dedicated efforts and engagement. they've done a tremendous job navigating this past year's volatile environment and ensuring we emerge stronger. with their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor and winning, they drive our momentum and success.
now, i'll turn it over to mike. mike?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone. for the reasons lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. our second quarter performance was very strong. starting with our top-line growth, as seen on slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year with incremental sales from our cholula and fona acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments. higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with flavor solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment. versus the second quarter of 2019, we grew sales 18% in constant currency.
during the second quarter, our consumer segment lapped exceptionally high demand for our products driven by the surge in consumers cooking more at home at the onset of the pandemic. as such, versus last year, our second quarter consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the cholula acquisition. compared to the second quarter of 2019, consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency.
on slide 18, consumer segment sales in the americas, lapping the demand surge in the year ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of cholula. compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency with significant broad-based growth across the mccormick-branded portfolio.
in the emea, constant currency consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. notably, this decline includes growth in our u.k. and eastern european markets on top of their significant growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. on a two year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region.
consumer sales in the asia pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in wuhan last year with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in india, resulting from a slower covid-19 recovery.
turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 21. we grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our fona and cholula acquisitions. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher sales of away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. compared to the second quarter of 2019, flavor solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency.
in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with fona and cholula contributing 13%. volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers as well as growth to packaged food and beverage companies, with particular strength in snack seasonings and beverages. on a two year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business.
in emea, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to qsrs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019 driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and qsr customers.
in the asia pacific region, flavor solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year led by growth for qsrs in china and australia, partially due to new products and our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from covid-19 lockdowns in countries outside of china in the year ago period. sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019.
as seen on slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the cholula and fona acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency 4% in the second quarter versus the year ago period. adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency 26% driven by -- primarily by lower sales.
in the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales. both segments were favorably impacted by product mix and cci-led cost savings with a partial offset from cost inflation, including transportation costs. covid-19-related costs were comparable to the year ago period. additionally, in the consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% in the second quarter of last year.
as seen on slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points with the increase in brand marketing partially offset by leverage from sales growth. adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margins declined by 200 basis points. in addition to the factors i just mentioned, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both margins. importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points even considering incremental covid-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments.
turning to income taxes. our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year ago period. both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year due to discrete tax item related to the refinement of our entity structure. adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021. at the end of march, we completed the sale of our minority stake in eastern condiments, one of our joint ventures in india. for 2021, we now expect a low-single-digit decline in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, partially due to the elimination of ongoing income from eastern. previously, we were projecting a low-single-digit increase.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide 29, second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year ago period. the decline was primarily driven by a higher adjusted income tax rate. as compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
on slide 30, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021 compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020. this change primarily resulted from a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. we returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. we expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on slides 31 and 32. with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. for 2021, we are projecting top-line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid-19 cost and the erp investment as well as the prior projected adjusted effective tax rate. we expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage points favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously. and for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates.
at the top-line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously. this includes the incremental impact of the cholula and fona acquisitions, projected to be at the high end of the 3.5% to 4% range. we anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and our customer engagement growth plans. pricing, taken to partially offset cost inflation, is also expected to contribute to sales growth.
we are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020. our previous projection was comparable to 2020. we are increasing our inflation expectation for the year to a mid-single-digit increase as compared to a low-single-digit increase previously. overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, covid-19 costs and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing as well as margin accretion from the cholula and fona acquisitions. as a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. we do not margin up. our estimate for covid-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted through the first half of the year.
reflecting the changes in our sales and gross profit margin outlooks, we are increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased covid-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental erp investment. this results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency. this projection includes the inflationary pressure i just mentioned as well as our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. it also includes an expected low-single-digit increase in brand marketing investments.
we also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. this outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 4%. we are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. this increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, as i mentioned earlier.
our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously. this compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. this growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact i just mentioned related to covid-19 cost, our incremental erp investment and the tax headwind.
i'll now turn it back to lawrence.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i would like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on slide 33. in the second quarter, we drove exceptional growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. we delivered significant double-digit year-to-date and two year growth rates for sales and profit, reflecting a robust growth momentum. we have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. we expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic. and we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term consumer trends, which accelerated during the pandemic, while continuing the momentum we are gaining in away-from-home consumption.
our enthusiasm for cholula and fona and our confidence we'll deliver on our plans has only strengthened. our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance, while also investing for the future growth we expect. we are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond.
and now, let's turn to your questions.

good morning, everybody.

hi, andrew. good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. one question to start off with. i know that the last couple of quarters you've talked about how some markets that have recovered more fully, so let's say china or in australia, you had still elevated consumption trends for the at-home business even as the away-from-home business has essentially fully recovered. and i just wanted to get a sense of, do you still believe or do you believe that that represents a reasonably good gauge for how we should expect trends to play out here in the u.s. or maybe there are some discrete differences between these markets in that regard that you would want to highlight? and then i've just got a quick follow-up.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, andrew. well, first of all, we do continue to expect consumer demand for at-home cooking products to remain elevated coming out of the pandemic. we're certainly seeing that all over the world. our research and survey data with consumers that we commented on just a few minutes ago, all points in that direction. and the behavior seems to be bearing it out.
of course, in this quarter, in many developed markets, we're lapping extraordinary consumption when lockdowns were heavily for the -- placed for the first time. but even in these markets, and at this time, if you look at the stack two year, you can see consumption is still up very dramatically versus then. and just all indications are that that's going to be the case. we are seeing foodservice recover. and it is a bit of a paradox that consumer consumption at-home seems to be remaining high and foodservice is recovering. we don't believe that people are eating more, but we do believe that they are cooking more, and that benefits our more ingredient-based flavor products.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for that. and then just focusing in, i guess, specifically on the part of your flavor solutions segment that is -- that our sales to other cpg companies. i guess, i'm curious, if we think toward the back half of the year, would you anticipate that part of your business to be up year-over-year just based on the elevated consumption levels that we're continuing to see for some other cpg names in the packaged food and beverage space?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. well, without trying to dissect flavor solutions too much, yes, first of all, that part of the business had largely returned to its normal growth rate toward the end of last year. it has been strong through this year. but within our portfolio, you can't miss the fact that we've done a big acquisitions in that flavor solutions space. we're seeing a different mix of products as well. tremendous growth of beverages and innovation around the hard seltzers and things like that.
with fona in particular, we tapped into a whole new addressable market around nutrition and health products. so the portfolio migration is a big driver of our ongoing results in that part of the portfolio as well.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's really part of our long-term strategy to migrate the flavor solutions portfolio to this high growth categories like beverages.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the status of inventories in u.s. consumer. i think you talked about them being relatively high or low rather last quarter and the rest of the year there will be a little bit of a build there. i'm just curious, where do you think those inventories stand now? did the rebuild help a lot in 2q? i didn't necessarily hear you quantify that. so i just wanted to -- a little bit of an update there, if possible?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure, ken. and i'm glad to do that, and i'll try to quantify it as well here in q2. well, first of all, this is an americas consumer issue. we're shifting to consumption and have been in the rest of the world. so our flavor solutions isn't impacted by this. in the americas consumer, we weren't able to keep up with the sustained demand, and so trade inventories and perhaps the consumer pantries have been depleted. and so there has been a need to do a rebuild.
you all saw on the shelf that especially as we came through the end of last year, the shelves were pretty rough. a number of you on the call, and ken, i think maybe you also have written about pdps and so on. but we're about 90% of the weight of restoring the shelf. we've ended suspensions. we still have a few products on allocation and demand has continued to be really strong. so in some cases very much hand to mouth on some product. old bay is a product that requires a lot of blending capacity. and so we're bit hand to mouth on that one, believe it or not. but in terms of restocking the shelf, honestly, we have done a little bit more in the second quarter. i said, we're at 90%, we would really hope to have it all done, and there is still more work to do because the demand has just continued to remain high through this period.
if you just do the math, there is a lot of noise in the year ago numbers. and so if you take it back to '20 and then year ago, consumption was up tremendously, but we couldn't ship to that. our shipments flagged a lot. so if you compare back to 2019, our consumption is up in second quarter 18% versus 2019. our organic sales stripping out acquisitions are up 22%. i would suggest there's about a 4% inventory rebuilding impact in the second quarter on our americas consumer business. so it was a factor. it's not as big as i think a lot of people have in their minds.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you for that. and then i wanted to ask -- that was helpful. i wanted to ask on flavor solutions. the margin did improve nicely year-on-year. it's still down over 100 basis points versus 2019 even though your organic sales are up over that time. i realize we're a little bit apples-to-oranges here, you've added some businesses. but just curiously, how are you thinking about, i guess, the drivers of the margin recovery from here and maybe the pace of margin recovery over the next couple of quarters?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, as you say -- ken, this is mike. i mean, we had a large recovery on the margin last year, but it pretty much lapped what we did in the second quarter of the prior year. i think the reality -- and this -- as some costs go up, as we pass through pricing, you're going to have a natural compression in the flavor solutions business, which we've seen in the past. yes, we passed through penny cost, as we said.
covid costs obviously hit us in the second quarter, although we were comparable to last year overall, but there were some segment mix there. we do feel that within the flavor solutions category, the one we're filling out, that's a nice margin bump. but even within the product portfolio, we see some margin positives as we migrate the business. so as we grow sales more and get that -- get more leverage the rest of the year, we're lapping a pretty soft second since six last year, we're hopeful that will improve too.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey, rob.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. i wanted to know, in the americas, we've heard in the industry that it's a little bit more difficult to negotiate with retailers on merchandising and pricing if you'd had continued supply problems. maybe your category is different and because of your leadership it's different. but what have the conversations been regarding that with your retailer customers? has it compromised you at all in getting done what you need to get done?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i don't want to get too specific about our conversations with customers on pricing. there is always the amount of commercial tension in our pricing discussions, but we're really confident that we're going to be able to get through the pricing that we need. we take a long-term perspective with our customers. they know that we are fair, that we are transparent in our cost. there is broad-based inflation that's recognized by everybody. it's not just us that's going up in isolation, the whole industry is moving. and so we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to take the pricing that we need. we're going to use all of the levers that we have to address costs.
so pricing certainly has to be part of the solution. but cost savings and revenue management are going to factor into dealing with the inflation issue. and i think we have pretty strong confidence that these discussions are going to be positive. i think we're continuing to invest in our brand where most of the share of voice in the category which our customers know that, and you saw year-to-date we're up nicely on a&p, and again, into the third quarter. so that is supporting their business too.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and a follow-up question, maybe just for modeling, mike. can third quarter profits still be up year-over-year? because you mentioned that there's going to be a lag effect on inflation, i just want to make sure we're getting the phasing right. and then i would imagine, fourth quarter, do you have a very easy comparison to a year ago because of the inventory -- because of the supply chain shortages a year ago?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you're right. we're lapping a third quarter -- a strong third quarter last year with about 8% total growth, 5% constant currency and the consumer business was stronger compared to flavor last year. so from a segment mix perspective, it's a little bit of a headwind in the third quarter. and you're right, the lagging of pricing does help the fourth quarter. we're also, as i just mentioned, higher brand marketing in the third quarter. if you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we had a -- i think it was around 20% a&p increase which we've continued in q1 and q2. so it would an easier fourth quarter comparison from an a&p perspective. and a little bit from the sales of sales in the fourth quarter for the company were below that 9% constant currency, i mentioned before.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think mike is talking about kind of the shape because we try to avoid giving too specific guidance on any particular quarter. these are our biggest quarters of the year coming up. so part of our thinking as we set guidance for the year.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. well, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your question.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hello, alexia. good morning.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
hi, there. so i guess, picking up on some earlier questions, are you able to sort of quantify what your input cost inflation outlook looks like at the moment? are we talking about mid-single-digit cogs inflation, perhaps including the freight component as well? i just want to get a sense for the order of magnitude there. and then i have a follow-up.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, alexia. yeah, our previous guidance was low-single-digit. we've moved that to mid-single-digit. and as we said on the call, i mean, the three components, obviously, the freight -- and the ocean freight we've talked about which is hitting everyone. we source a lot of our products from the asia market. so those rates are up. but also packaging due to resin costs and things like that going up. and then thirdly, commodities. but yeah, low-single-digit to mid-single-digit outlook this year.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. and then i'm just curious about the market share trends that we're seeing in the u.s. nielsen data. it looks as though there is some shell off happening on the core herbs and spices area, am i right in that? and do you expect that to correct going forward or is it just because of strange comparisons from the year ago period at this point?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a little bit of both. and so first, yes, we do expect that to turn positive. in the year ago period, we had heavy supply. through second quarter, we were in a great stock position. we were building inventories for an erp pilot. and so we had unusually high stock levels of finished goods ourselves going -- when the crisis hit, which enabled us to have extraordinary supply in the early weeks of the pandemic that we'll see by the end of second quarter. so it's a very different situation, but we're going into the quarter strong.
and so our shelf position was really advantaged. and then, of course, we went through a long period where we weren't able to meet the demand and our shelf position deteriorated, we had to suspend items, put them on allocation, stop promotion and so on. and our total distribution points declined as a result. and so we're comparing against the period of unusual strength at retail. and in the year ago period and in this period, we've got a time when we are rebuilding our shelf position pretty much everywhere where we've been able to have good supply and good service to our customers. our share has grown not declined. that's the case across our markets in europe. that's the case in some categories here in the u.s. the real pressure point has been herbs and spices and recipe mixes. there were just an extraordinary demand ran down the shelf. and as we restore it, we are confident that our share position is going to improve.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. [indecipherable] maybe think a little bit longer term and some of the kind of key takeaways and points you've been highlighting on the call, talked about the increases in at-home consumption could have some staying power and that uniquely benefits your portfolio. i'm wondering how, if at all, that makes you think about the long-term organic sales potential of the business. i mean, you have a long-term 4% to 6% kind of sales growth algorithm that encompasses a little bit of m&a over time. so 2% to 4% -- 2% to 5% organic embedded in that. do the changes in consumption post-pandemic make you think that that long-term organic sales growth potential could be higher? and if not, why?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so i don't think we're going to raise our long-term guidance today. so that's -- we are confident in that long-term guidance is really reinforced by what we're seeing. there's been a lot of talk about changes in consumer behavior, but really is an amplification of trends that were already in place that we believe are long-term secular trends that underlie our growth and that our strategies are designed to capitalize on.
the global demand for flavor has been growing steadily for -- i don't even know how long, it's tremendous amount. euromonitor projects global flavor demand to grow at 6% rate going forward for the next five years, and that is really the foundation for our sales growth. i mean if you just think about compared to 2019, underlying global demand for flavor growing in the absence of the pandemic, 6% cagr, you would expect us to be up 12%.
so i think that the performance that you're seeing is really more of a bleed through of what you're going to see in a post-pandemic world. consumers were cooking at home more before the pandemic. we believe that that was accelerated that people currently are lot of lapsed cooks, had the opportunity to cook. everyone learned their grandma and their mother's secret recipes and how to prepare them. someone in every household has become a very proficient cook, and it's been a positive experience for people. so they have -- it's been an outlet for creativity, it's brought families together and we think that this is a behavior that is going to chippy.
younger consumers in particular have leaned toward healthy, flavorful, more scratch cooking. and in particular, among gen z, a return to trusted brands and brands with some nostalgia. we think that these are really long-term demographic trends are going to benefit us for a long time. so our confidence in our long-term guidance is reinforced what we're seeing right now. mike, do you want to build on that?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think too. maybe another testament to our broad -based differentiated portfolio. but if you -- adam, to your question about our 4% to 6% constant currency long-term growth, of which a third of that is m&a. so bolt-on m&a, you take that out. so you're kind of highlighting a 2.5% is our long-term guidance. last year, constant currency organic growth was 5%. this year, the midpoint of our guidance is around 5% too. so we're seeing -- and i think the lines that -- the acceleration of those trends is reinforcing our belief on that organic growth of our long-term guidance.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then a follow-up, just a modeling question, trying rob's question a little bit differently. just remind us the $30 or so million of erp expenses, headwind year-on-year, how much of that's been already incurred in the first half of the year? and $50 million of covid-related expenses that you expect in fiscal '21, how much has been already incurred year-to-date just so we're thinking about the first half, second half?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the erp is mostly going to be a second half headwind and had very little impact year-on-year in the first half. from a covid perspective, we had guided to $60 million for this year versus $50 million last year, and that's mostly been occurred in the first half.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. okay. that's really helpful. all right. thank you.

mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, peter.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
mike, the gross margin, just wanted to go back there, the commentary or the new guidance on kind of 80 to 100 bps lower. it sounded like in your comments that actually mix or sales mix moving back to flavor solutions might have been a bigger impact actually than cost inflation. so i just kind of wanted to clarify that comment and just see if there's kind of a way to break out those two, kind of how they impact between mix and the cost inflation?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. really in the second quarter, it was mainly segment mix, as we said. the costs have been rising, but we have taken some pricing. but it's really around segment mix in q2. it changed a little bit in the second six, as we've guided, our gross margin, probably between 90 and 120 basis points. if you do the squeeze on the gross margin, two-thirds of that is really -- we're raising sales due to some pricing, offsetting inflation and then fx piece is not dropping through the profit. so that's about two-thirds of that compression. the other third is some of the lag in the pricing. costs are coming through in the third quarter. we got pricing a little later. so it's a little bit of that. but it's basically two-thirds due to math and third due to kind of the timing of the pricing.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, ok. no, that's helpful. and then maybe just two more quick modeling questions. i didn't see in the guidance anything on capital spend for the year or interest expense as well.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we don't -- i mean, you'll see in the q coming out today, capital hasn't changed from last quarter. and so we don't still give interest guidance.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst

kasey jenkins -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, this is kasey jenkins, vice president of mccormick investor relations. thank you for joining today's third quarter earnings call. to accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mcvcormick.com. we will begin with remarks from lawrence kurzius, chairman, president and ceo; and mike smith, executive vice president and cfo, and we'll close with a question-and-answer session.

i will now turn the discussion over to lawrence.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, kasey. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. our third quarter performance demonstrates again that the combination of our balanced portfolio with the effective execution of our strategies to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends and strong engagement with our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth. remarkably, we delivered an 8% sales increase versus last year and 17% versus 2019.
our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum, as we delivered organic sales growth on top of our exceptional third quarter performance last year. our third quarter results also included strong contributions from our cholula and fona. sales growth in our flavor solutions segment was broad-based, with the at-home products in our portfolio, flavors and seasonings growing at approximately the same rate as our away from home products, which was primarily driven by a robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers attributable to covid-19 restrictions and consumers' reluctance to dine out.
our consumer segment results reflect the lapping of the year-ago elevated demand in the lockdown phase of the pandemic, from consumers eating and cooking more at home, as well as the sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels. taken together, these results continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, the breadth and reach of our portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels creates a balanced and diversified portfolio that enables us to drive consistency in our performance even in a volatile environment.
turning to slide 5. total third quarter sales grew 8% from the year-ago period or 5% in constant currency. substantial constant currency sales growth in our flavor solution segment more than offset a slight constant currency sales decline in our consumer segment, driven by the factors i just mentioned. adjusted operating income was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher cost inflation and industry logistics challenges as well as by a shift in sales between segments. on the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 in the year-ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures.
as we have stated previously, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021. importantly, we have delivered outstanding year-to-date performance. sales and adjusted operating income are up 13% and 9% year-over-year respectively, both of which include a 3% favorable impact from currency and we've grown adjusted earnings per share of 8%. year-to-date versus 2019, we've driven sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of nearly 20% across all three metrics.
i'd like to say a few words about the current cost environments impact on our third quarter results as well as our outlook, which mike will cover in more detail. we stated in our july earnings call we are operating in a dynamic cost environment and like the rest of the industry experiencing cost pressures, we're seeing broad-based inflation across our raw and packaging materials as well as transportation costs to partially offset rising costs, we have raised prices where appropriate, but as usual, there is a timeline associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating and therefore the phasing of most of our actions has taken place during the fourth quarter. those pricing actions are on track and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment.
in the last few months, inflation has continued to ratchet up, mainly with packaging and transportation cost. we are experiencing the highest inflationary period of the last decade or even two. we, along with our peers and customer are also facing additional pressure on our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity and labor shortages and distribution. these pressures not only impact costs but also negatively impact sales as the addition of further supply chain complexity makes it harder to get order shipped and received by customers. and this pressure is amplified by continued elevated demand. overall, we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary period with a combination of pricing and cost savings and we expect to manage through this period as we have in the past.
now let's turn to our third quarter segment business performance, which includes comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as we believe these will be more meaningful than the comparison for 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away from home experienced in the year-ago period.
starting on slide 7, consumer segment sales grew 1%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency and incremental sales from our cholula acquisition compared to the highly elevated demand levels of the year-ago period. our consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpaces pre-pandemic level.
our americas constant currency sales declined 1% in the first quarter, with incremental sales from our cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. our total mccormick u.s. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined 10% following a 31% consumption increase in the third quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a two-year basis. and that has remained high and we are realizing the benefit of our u.s. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stressed by sustained high demand. shelf conditions are improving and we're seeing sequential improvement in our share performance. that said, as i mentioned a moment ago, the current issues related to logistics pressures continue to make it challenging for market leaders like mccormick to keep high demand products and stock, which has prevented us from making further progress in replenishing both retailer and consumer inventories in the third quarter. importantly though, we are better positioned than we were last year entering the holiday season and are confident in our holiday merchandising plans.
focusing further on our u.s. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the third quarter of 2019 was led by double-digit growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauces, both cholula and frank's redhot, and barbecue sauce, as well as our asian frozen product. in pure play e-commerce, we delivered triple-digit growth compared to 2019, with mccormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. this is the sixth consecutive quarter our u.s. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the same period two years ago, which reflects continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands.
our key categories continued to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the same period of two years ago, favorably impacting not only the mccormick brand but our smaller brands as well. household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. and when our consumers shop, they're buying more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. mccormick continues to win in hot sauce. across our brands, mccormick grows to be the number one hot sauce manufacturer globally earlier this year. in the third quarter, frank's redhot, the number one brand in the u.s., was joined at the top of the category by cholula, which we have driven to the number two ranking.
now turning to emea, which has continued its outstanding momentum. we had strong market share performance in the third quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share across the region and key categories following our strong gains in the third quarter last year. compared to the third quarter of 2019, our total emea region we drove double-digit consumption growth in herbs, spices and seasonings. and turning up the heat, frank's redhot has grown consumption 75% and had gained a significant share versus the two year-ago period. across the region, our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two year-ago period. our year-to-date higher brand marketing investments in emea are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics i just discussed, as well as our achieving above benchmark rates, the reach, engagement and click-through for instance in our digital marketing.
in the asia-pacific region, third quarter sales were strong, reflecting our continued recovery from china's lower branded foodservice sales last year. our consumer product demand in the region declined due to lapping significant growth last year. the region is also experienced supply chain challenges with ocean freight capacity constraints impacting the quarter's growth. in australia, we continue to see strong consumption growth versus 2019, with key brands recently turning back toward 2020 levels, with frank's redhot already higher than the last year's elevated consumption.
across all regions in our consumer segment, we are continuing to fuel our growth with our strong brand marketing, new product launches and our category management initiatives. we're making brand marketing investments across our portfolio to connect with our consumers, particularly online. early in the third quarter in the americas, we began our search for the first director of taco relations. this was a dream opportunity for the over 5,000 applicants to showcase their taco expertise and enthusiasm for our product and their video application. to date, we have garnered over 1 billion earned impressions related to our search, and these will continue to grow upon the announcement of our new director of taco relations next week, on october 4th, in celebration of national taco day.
we are not only creating buzz through our digital marketing, but also with our e-commerce direct to consumer new product launches. in the americas, we drove new passionate users to our brands and digital properties with the launch of sunshine all purpose seasoning, a new product developed in partnership with social media influencer tabitha brown, inspired by her joyful personality and health and wellness focused recipes, the salt-free and gluten-free caribbean inspired blend sold out in just 39 minutes, generating record sales from e-commerce driven innovation and over 700 million earned impressions.
our new product launches differentiate our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. and with our global leadership position in our sauce, we are in the perfect position to capitalize on consumers' rising demand for hot and spicy flavors through a global heat platform. our recent launches of frank's redhot frozen appetizers and cholula wing sauces in the americas, as well as frank's redhot craft flavors in emea have made strong contributions to growth in the third quarter. just in time for halloween, emea is introducing dead hot gift sets for e-commerce, featuring frank's redhot. and in china, our recently launched ready to eat chili paste as the highest 30-day repeat rate of all mccormick direct to consumer products on tmall.
turning to category management. our initiatives are designed to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both mccormick and retailers. these initiatives include simply changing shelf placement. for instance, increasing cholula velocity over 30% or changing the tile [phonetic] placement at a large retailer, to reinventing the spice and seasoning of shopping experience. in the u.s., we are anticipating a cumulative implementation of our spice aisle [phonetic] program, so it began in 2020 at 10,000 stores by year-end versus 2019 to remove year over year noise, sales in the beginning of august show retailers that have adopted the spice aisle changes are growing the category faster than those who have not, and mccormick branded spices and seasoning portfolio is growing solid mid-single digits faster in implemented stores versus stores which have not the adopted the changes.
and in eastern europe, the rollout of our first choice bottle, which has perceived this premium and what was predominantly sachet only market is elevating the spices and seasoning category and driving increased share in our eastern european market. moving forward, we are confident that we will continue the momentum of our consumer segment. we have more consumers than pre-pandemic. they have come into our brands, are having a good experience and our buying our products again. we are excited about our growth trajectory and expect long lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives.
turning to slide 9, our flavor solutions segment grew 21% or 17% in constant currency, reflecting both strong base business growth and contributions from our fona and cholula acquisition. our third quarter results includes the robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers, many of which are lapping the curtailment approach of away from home dining, as well as strong continued momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and the away from home products in our portfolio. on a two-year basis, our sales also increased double digits, with strong growth in all three regions.
in the americas, our fona and cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant third quarter growth, and we're executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. we continue to see outstanding growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers to new products and base business constrain. consumers' rising global demand for hot and spicy flavors is driving growth for both our customer and for our seasonings that flavor them. compared to last year's third quarter, snack seasonings grew high single digits with strong growth in core iconic product as well as new products, and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust.
our confidence will accelerate our global flavors platform continues to be reinforced by their excellent performance with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. beverages are driving significant growth with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category. and finally in the americas, branded foodservice contributed significant growth for the quarter and our [indecipherable] channel has continued to strengthen as more dining options reopen.
in emea, we had strong growth versus both last year and 2019 across all markets and channels. quick service restaurants or qsrs are driving growth through increased promotional activities and limited time offers. our branded foodservice sales with easing restrictions in the hospitality industry increased at a double-digit rate versus the third quarter of last year and as packaged food and beverage companies our performance was strong on top of last year's strong growth, but the hot and spicy trends fueling growth in snack seasonings particularly through new product innovation.
our sales growth in the asia pacific region was partially impacted by the timing of our qsr customers strong limited time offers and the promotional activities in the third quarter of last year, which increased restaurant traffic as covid-19 restrictions lifted. as we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities and cause some sales volatility from quarter to quarter.
we recognize a part of our third quarter flavor solutions results were due to the comparison to low away from home demand last year. notably, our growth also includes strong contributions from fona and cholula, robust growth with packaged food and beverage customers both in the base business and the new product wins, driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with qsr. year-to-date versus 2019, we delivered 13% constant currency growth, including fona and cholula and 6% constant currency organic growth. these results combined with our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence and a continuation of our robust growth trajectory in our flavor solutions segment.
now on slide 10, i'm excited to share some important purpose-led performances. just a few days ago, we were named as a global compact lead company by the united nations for our ongoing commitment to the un global compact and its 10 principles for responsible business. we are honored by this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and to be one of only 37 companies in the world and the only u.s.-based food producer to be included on this prestigious list. sustainable sourcing is the top priority and we've been actively working on initiatives such as our sustainability-linked financing partnership with ifc and citi, which provides our urban spice suppliers in indonesia and vietnam with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability, as well as our partnership with heifer international on the launch of the cardaforestry project, which aims to increase smallholder farmer resilience and improve the quality of cardamom and all spice in guatemala. in addition, latina style, inc. recently named us as one of the top 50 best companies for latinos to work in the u.s. we are thrilled to be recognized for our continued efforts for our diversity and inclusive.
we are committed to the long-term vitality of the people, communities and the planet we share and are proud of our impact in these areas. we look forward to sharing more about these accomplishments as well as many others with you through our purpose-led performance report, which will be issued early next year. before turning it over to mike, i'd like to make some qualitative comments regarding 2022. to be clear, we are not providing 2022 guidance at this time. we are a growth company and we expect to grow in both of our segments next year. at the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor, fueled by younger generations. we've intentionally focused on great categories that are growing and generating a long-term tailwind. we are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic and for successfully executing on our strategies and initiatives.
in this dynamic and fast-paced environment, we are ensuring that we remain focused on long-term sustainable growth. recently, cost pressures have rapidly accelerated and we are preparing for that to remain in 2022. we plan to mitigate these costs, which we expect to fully offset over time through a combination of cci-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and pricing actions as needed. in addition, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. we also expect the impact of covid-19 to persist into 2022, which will create continued broad-based supply chain challenges. we successfully demonstrated in the past our ability to manage through inflationary environment and cost pressures. importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence that our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation to top line growth and margin expansion. we have a strong foundation and remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. around the world, mccormick employees drive our momentum and success and i thank them for their hard work, engagement and dedication, particularly in such a volatile environment.
and now, i'll turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, and good morning, everyone. for the reasons lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. starting on slide 13. our top line growth continues to be strong. we grew constant currency sales 5% during the third quarter compared to last year with incremental sales from our cholula and fona acquisitions contributing 4% across both segments. higher volume and mix drove our organic sales increase with flavor solutions growth offset any decline in the consumer segment. versus the third quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency with both segments growing double-digits.
during the third quarter, our consumer segment continued to lap last year's exceptionally high demand. versus 2020, our third quarter consumer segment sales declined 1% in constant currency, which includes a 3% increase from the cholula acquisition. compared to the third quarter of 2019, consumer segment sales grew 14% in constant currency.
on slide 14, consumer segment sales in the americas declined 1% in constant currency, lapping the elevated lockdown demand in the year-ago period, as well as the logistics challenges lawrence mentioned earlier. incremental sales from the cholula acquisition contributed 3% growth. compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 17% in constant currency, led by significant growth in the mccormick, lawry's, grill mates, old bay, frank's redhot, cholula, zatarain's, gourmet garden, simply asia, stubb's and [indecipherable] branded products, that's a lot of brands, partially offset by a decline in private label.
in emea, constant currency consumer sales declined 11% from a year-ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. notably, this decline includes strong growth in our eastern european market, on top of their significant volume growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. on a two-year basis, sales increased 10% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our kamis, schwartz, and frank's redhot branded products.
consumer sales in the asia pacific region increased 11% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year-ago period. sales increased 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in india, resulting from a slower covid-19 recovery.
turning to our flavor solutions segment and slide 17, we grew third quarter constant currency sales 17%, including an 8% increase from our fona and cholula acquisitions. the year-over-year increase, led by the americas and emea regions, was due to strong growth with both packaged food and beverage customers and in away from home products. compared to the third quarter of 2019, flavor solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency.
in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 19% year-over-year with fona and cholula contributing 12%. volume and product mix increased, driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers together with growth for packaged food and beverage companies, with strength in snack seasonings. on a two-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019, with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business.
in emea, constant currency sales grew 19% compared to last year due to increased sales to qsrs and branded foodservice customers, as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. constant currency sales increased 23% versus the third quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and qsr customers.
in the asia pacific region, flavor solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2019, was driven by qsr growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers limited time offers and promotional activities.
as seen on slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the cholula and fona acquisitions as well as special charges, was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 10% to $180 million or in constant currency 12%, driven by the cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges, partially offset by cci-led cost savings. these logistics challenges not only impacted cost, but also negatively impacted sales.
in the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 32% to $84 million or 27% in constant currency. higher sales, cci-led cost savings and favorable product mix as we continue to migrate our portfolio more than offset the cost pressures in this segment. across both segments, incremental investment spending for our erp program was offset by lower covid-19 costs compared to last year.
during the quarter, we invested in brand marketing ahead of last year and notably we have increased our investments 11% on a year-to-date basis.
as seen on slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points, driven primarily by the cost pressures we are experiencing and the lag in pricing. our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 110 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. these impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin declined 150 basis points. in addition to the factors i mentioned a few moments ago, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both gross and operating margins.
turning to income taxes. our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 14.1% compared to 19.3% in the year-ago period. both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with the larger impact this year due to the favorable impact of a reversal of a tax accrual. adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 5% versus the third quarter of 2020. based on our year-to-date results, we now expect a mid single-digit increase in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations for 2021, up from our previous projection, but a low single-digit decrease. this improvement is driven by strong performance from our mccormick de mexico joint venture.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide 25, third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 for the year-ago period. the increase was primarily driven by lower adjusted income tax rate. as compared to the third quarter of 2019, our 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by sales growth.
on slide 26, we summarize highlights for cash flow in the quarter end balance sheet. through the third quarter of 2021, our cash flow from operations was $373 million, which is lower than the same period last year. the decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction integration costs and higher use of cash associated with working capital. this includes the impact of planned higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues, as well as buffer against cost volatility. through the third quarter, we returned $272 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $190 million for capital expenditures. our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on slides 27 and 28. with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and underlying performance, tempered by the higher inflation ahead of pricing and the logistic challenges we previously mentioned. for 2021, we are projecting topline and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid-19 costs and erp investment, as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. we continue to expect an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales. and for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a 2 percentage point favorable impact with currency rates.
at the topline, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 9% to 10%, which is the high end of our previous projection of 8% to 10%, and includes a 40% incremental impact from the cholula and fona acquisitions. we had initially projected an incremental acquisition impact in the range of 3.5% to 4%. we anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing and new products, as well as pricing.
we're now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 150 basis points to 170 basis points lower than 2020 due to the increase in cost pressures i mentioned earlier. while we continue to expect a mid single-digit increase in inflation for the year, it has moved higher and is now approaching a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter. overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impact from sales mix between segments, cost inflation and covid-19 costs, partially offset by pricing and margin accretion from the cholula and fona acquisitions. as a reminder, we price to offset cost increases, we do not margin up. our estimate for covid-19 costs remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020, and is weighted to the first half of the year.
reflecting the change in gross profit margin outlook, we are lowering our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 8% to 10% constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges and partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased covid-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental erp investment. this results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 4% to 6% in constant currency. this projection includes the mid-single digit inflationary pressure as well as our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. it also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments.
considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items, we now project our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 21% as compared to our previous projection of 23%. this outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 1%. we are lowering our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 5% to 7% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. this reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income tax rate, as well as the higher adjusted income from unconsolidated operations.
our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02. this compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020 and represents 8% to 10% growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to covid-19 costs, our incremental erp investment and the tax headwind.
i'll now turn it back to lawrence.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
now that mike the shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 29. our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we drove strong sales growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. year-to-date versus 2019, we have driven significant double-digit growth rates for sales, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. we have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio which drives consistency in our performance. we expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and are continuing the momentum we are gaining in away from home consumption. we're are confident the growth and momentum of our business is sustainable.
as a reminder, mccormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of short-term pressures. our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term growth algorithm to drive continuous value creation to topline growth and margin expansion. we're driving mccormick forward and building value for our shareholders.
now let's turn to your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your questions.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi, andrew.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi. maybe to start out -- at our recent conference and then again this morning you alluded to costs and supply chain disruptions likely continuing into fiscal '22, others have made very similar sort of comments. of course, you'll have more pricing kicking in among other actions to mitigate some of the challenges. i think you also had mentioned that erp costs could be offset by covid expenses coming down. so i guess things remain very fluid, of course, and you're not obviously giving specific '22 guidance as of yet, but i'm trying to get a sense of whether on algorithm year, particularly on the profit side would be too much to ask in fiscal '22 at this stage. all things considered, particularly given what i assume will be continued margin pressure at least through the first half of next year?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
all right. well, first of all, andrew. thanks for the opportunity to talk about the pretty high level question, right, out of the -- out of the gate. in your question you included a couple of my points that i would actually make to answer it. beginning with this, just to be clear i'm not going to give guidance for next year. there are a lot of moving parts, things are fluid. we are right in the middle of putting together our budgets for next year right now. as we said in the call, our long -- we are very confident about our algorithm over the long-term. i'm just not ready to talk about it in 2022 specifically just yet. but in our prepared remarks i did say we expect growth in both segments and so i'll start there and then i'll bring it back to profit.
mccormick is unique and that we've been differentiated by strong growth. the underlying trends that support our business includes the demographic tailwind from younger consumers that has nothing to do with the pandemic and then many of the consumption trends we believe were reinforced and accelerated by the pandemic. so we believe that going into the pandemic our growth was differentiated already through it. it's been differentiated and coming out, but it continues to be differentiated. we made investments, including during the time of the pandemic, both organic and through smart acquisitions that put our portfolio more and more into high growth categories like hot sauce and and flavor. and on top of this, we're going to have the topline benefit of pricing in 2022. so we have good confidence in strong growth going forward.
for operating profit, there are a lot of puts and takes. over the last few years we've had rising erp investment. over the last two we've had the shock of extraordinary covid cost and right now as everyone else, not just in our industry, but across business in general are wrestling with decade high inflation and that's in everywhere, we're not unique. now the first two of these, rising european investment versus the covid cost should largely offset in 2022, and i think that given the magnitude of the cost as we've described previously, everyone should have an expectation around those largely offsetting. and first is that cost pricing is going to kick in. pricing has lagged. we have our pricing in the u.s., largely going into effect in the fourth in particular and so i would expect that we would see -- where you should expect to see the benefits from that not just on the topline, but running through the p&l. but remember the math says that margins compress when we take pricing.
our approach is to take pricing to pass through costs and so that both the numerator and the denominator go up and so the fraction gets a little bit smaller. so while we do expect that pricing to come in, it would be reasonable to expect some level of margin compression. nonetheless, with the pricing action and other steps will take to offset cost and the topline growth that we expect, i think it's very reasonable to expect solid operating profit growth next year. i'm not ready yet to say if it's exactly on algorithm.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
right. i appreciate that color. that's helpful. and then one very quick follow-up and it may be tough to parse out in the quarter though, are you able to sort of break out what impact some of the supply constraints may have had on overall sort of company organic growth? i think organic growth was up about 1%. i mean, if some of the supply constraints were significant enough that it would have meaningfully changed what organic growth looked like in the quarter. thanks so much.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it actually did have an impact on in the fourth quarter. i think we're in -- sorry, let's say fourth, i misspoke there, but it's third quarter. and we haven't quantified that and i'm not prepared to. but it was material. we normally would not have a backlog at all. they had the idea of having a backlog of orders is unprecedented. we have backlog that's measurable indeed and so it did have a -- it definitely had an impact. it would have been our hope to actually continue to rebuild trade inventories as we went through the quarter, which has not yet been fully recovered and we were not able to do. we've really wanted and planned to ship more, these logistics challenges are very real. we've got from a very -- from a very strategic discussion that's now are very tactical one, but just simply getting the product out there has been a challenge in the face of the, but it is still very high demand at the same time that we are having these logistical challenges. i'd say that the trade channels are still a bit starved for inventory.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we did narrow our range on sales to the high end of the range, so we had very strong confidence in the fourth quarter.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your questions.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. just on pricing, are there any geographies or categories or brands where maybe getting the pricing you hope for has been a little more challenging than in others? and i guess i'm curious where are you in your, i guess journey, so to speak of taking incremental pricing to offset some of the newer or more severe headwinds you're facing? i'm trying to figure out if you're still having conversations with customers, do you feel most of the heavy lifting is done there for maybe some of the second rounds that'd be helpful. thank you.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you know, first of all i won't say that there is a particular problem. these actions always have some degree of commercial tension in them and so i don't want to get too specific there. first, i must say there are ongoing conversations with customers. i think that there are some new conversations that we had. all of our actions on pricing are on a track, particularly for the u.s., the price increases that we talked about earlier in the year have been sold. there is a time lag though, especially with how quickly costs have gone up. inflation has accelerated since we launched those pricing point and so there is more work to do in that area in 2022. that most of our actions is happening in q4 and we would expect to see the benefit of that in 2022.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i think i'd point that, ken, to historical perspective here. we had higher inflationary periods in the past in the 2008-2009 timeframe, 2011-2012, where we successfully put in pricing. it's actually performed to my u.s. consumer during one of those time periods and we're able to pass through the pricing. we also put a lot of other level levers, whether it's cci, discretionary spending to get andrew's point about getting back on algorithm from a profit perspective.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great, thank you. and i'll pass it on there.
operator
next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. i think this question will sound like ken's question, maybe a different tack though. is the conversation different with retailers on how to take pricing or how to think about pricing in the latest -- in relation to the latest acceleration, because i think some retailers out there consider the supply chain disruption to be temporary, the labor challenges will go away and as a result, does that mean if you have to shift more toward, i don't know more variable actions on promotions or packaging changes rather than a straight up list price increase?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, again i'm going to say that i can't get specific about any one particular customer, certainly the pricing actions that we just took, we had a lot of company going out there. and so i think retailers -- what they heard from us was similar to what they heard from from others. i'm not so sure. we have not gotten that kind of feedback that retailers think that these increases are transitory. there's been some discussion about inflation not continuing to escalate, but there hasn't been any discussion about this not being a reset of pricing levels. and i think that there is broad recognition of that and i will say that i was on a call with chairman, jerome powell, yesterday, where he was saying very much the same thing. and so i think that the outlook is that these costs are not transient, there are here to stay and they are potentially going to have to find a way through in the form of pricing that gets to the consumer and the belt tightening across the entire supply chain, including us as a supplier to our customer.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. so you're saying is it's similar types of conversations, there is no different types of push back on the second round compared to the first round, its a similar conversation?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm not, i'm not -- not differentiating between the two right now. i think if i go much further than that i'm getting into specifics that are bit too granular and too perspective.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. anything else you want to, tell us about what jerome powell said or do you want to leave at that?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, just like -- you've got to do it in a public forum, so it's all out there.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
the next question is coming from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so i guess on the inflation dynamics you've highlighted specifically logistics and packaging and i just want to be clear that -- is that more on the ocean freight side, is it domestic trucking, all of the above? and beyond those two discrete buckets is there anything notable in terms of your own wage rates and are you seeing pressures in your own labor force domestically given the rise in -- given the broad-based labor pressures you're seeing?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
adam, it's mike, i'll take this and lawrence may add a few comments. i mean, like we said on the call, it is -- you're right, it's 80% to 90% of this is really logistics, transportation, packaging, things like that. so we have really good line of sight to our commodity costs in the fourth quarter obviously. it's really both ocean freight, but also domestic freight and you've actually seen after hurricane ida some of the domestic rates have gone up again. so that's part of the new news that i think we're all experiencing in the u.s. in particular. you've seen globally in the u.k., natural gas challenges and things like that too and trucking challenges. so it's both. it's both getting it here and getting it to customers. and from a wage rate perspective, we've taken actions just like other companies have to aggressively attract talent in our manufacturing facilities and dcs with retention bonuses and other actions like that. so i think it's lawrence's point, these labor rates aren't going to go back down. there have been a reset of cost level that it may not escalate further, that's to be seen, but it's not -- we're not going to have deflation on labor rates.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and i'll tell you, i'll just add to that, that the cost increase that we're talking about are not -- these are not things that are unique to mccormick at all. the biggest increases have been on packaged materials and on transportation costs followed by raw material and labor, and i'd say that that we'd look a lot like everybody else in that regard.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then if i could ask more longer-term margin question and it's really in the flavor solutions business. and i guess i'm thinking to kind of a couple of years pre-covid in that business and you've done through acquisition and internal initiatives have done a lot of heavy lifting to get the margins in that business to the kind of 14%, 15% level from about 10% back in 2015, 2016 and we're now back in the 13% to 14% range. i'm just trying to think about where that business can go from here once we maybe get through some of these price cost and balances in the near term? do you think there is a lot more room on mix to really push that business higher, their investments in technology and r&d on the flavor side that you've got to accelerate to temper that? i'm just trying to think about that being a driver of earnings growth maybe beyond some of the shorter term inflationary pressures that we're experiencing right now.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
[indecipherable] i have to bring you in to help write some of our ir materials. we have great confidence in the margin trajectory of our flavor solutions business. we're really changing in the portfolio. the big driver of our margin improvement over time has been the shift in the portfolio to more value-added technically insulated products we would organic investments and that part of the fitness we've done acquisitions in that part of the business to accelerate the growth. and as the portfolio continues to shift in that direction, that's going to drive a structural improvement in margin. those are just categories that command a better margin and it's going to mix the business up. and at the same time, we've made decision to get out of some of the lower margin stuff, some of which is really low margin and we found graceful ways of exiting some of that without getting on the wrong side of those customer relationships. so i'd say our long-term outlook for continued expansion of our flavor solution is one of the things that underpins our confidence in our long-term algorithm.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think like the fona acquisition has even given us more confidence and continuing to migrate that portfolio with really combining their technical expertise with ours.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and i'll just -- there has been a number of the notes we're going to try and parse it, organic sales from acquisition and so on. yeah, we're going to -- we're reporting a 100% of what we sell of fona as the acquisition related. but we have grown that business tremendously since we bought it and we're very [speech overlap] but your question specifically was about flavor solutions and that's really part of that portfolio migration.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, that's helpful color. i'll pass it on. thanks.

our next question is coming from the line of chris growe with stifel. please see with your question.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi, good morning.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi, i just had a question for, if i could, in relation to pricing. just understand, would you expect that your pricing would offset your inflation once all your pricing is in place?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i was going to say that all of the levers that we're going to pull...
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
yeah, fair enough.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
part of cci does is offset inflation to an extent, part of it offset cost increases and part of it we bring into reinvest in the business in other ways and part of it makes its way to the bottom line, that's need to. so i'm expecting that over time we'll recover all of the cost, all of the levers. it won't be 100% through pricing.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay, i understand, yeah thank you. i understand. the other question i was going to say was just, as you get into -- is it expected that you would have a lot of these levers pulled by say first quarter of 22? i know you've got some pricing going into place in the fourth quarter. i'm not trying to get to an exact time or guidance for next year. just to understand the timeframe around pulling all these levers?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think that -- i don't want to get too deep into talking about 2022. i did want to give guidance for the year and i don't want to give guidance for any of the quarters. yeah, but i do think -- i think that this is something that's going to unfold over time. we've taken pricing actions. we've said that inflation has continued to accelerate, so there's more to go, and i think that -- to think that's all going to be in place in q1 is probably not.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and also you realize that there is lot of focus on the u.s. timing, but this happens around the world at different indecipherable] local. so we'll have a lot more to say in the january call.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
understood. okay. and i had just one other question and it's just more to understand kind of this inventory situation will call it, i guess in rebuilding. we can debate iri or nielsen data, but it shows like your u.s. sales down 11% and again we can debate that number. i see your americas business, again not a perfect representation totally the u.s. being down 4%. is that gap the sort of inventory build you expected for this quarter year-over-year, knowing that you were shipping below inventory -- below consumption a year ago or is there more inventory build to come i guess? so i'm trying to get to.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
if you do the math -- looking back two years, so it look at the undisturbed 2019. last year, you're right, we weren't shipping to consumption, demand was extraordinarily elevated. and if you strip out the acquisition, you have demand. consumption is up 19%, our shipments are up 13% so just this right math on that would suggest we under shipped by about 6 percentage points, which is very substantial. we did that same math in q2 and it was -- we were ahead by 4% so, it looks like we've unwound some of the -- some of the inventory build that we did. but in 2019, we have a holiday terms program in place, which we normally would do, i mean normally in the third quarter. we're starting to build trade inventories from a heavy fall season. and so that would have been part of the underlying demand. so when you net that all out, we think we're pretty close to even on shipping versus the true change in consumption. but, so, that includes not being able to build for the trade inventories for the holiday as we would have hoped, and so we do think that we're a bit -- we're like as the federal, one of the questions earlier the trade channel right now is a bit starved for inventory in the us. we think of that as really sloshing between third and fourth quarter. and that still will end up getting captured within the year. so, it doesn't much change our outlook for the full year. it makes us anticipate a pretty strong -- a pretty strong fourth quarter. but to bring it back to where we are in rebuilding, we're not as far along as we would have hoped.
chris growe -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay, that was good color. thanks for the time.
operator
our next question is from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank. please proceed with your questions.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. hey, thanks. and you might have just -- i think you sort of addressed this in response to chris's question, but just to play it back. so when we think about your intention to fully offset pressures over time and appreciating that there is a rolling process to this, i think, i don't know if you were speaking to chris's response, specifically on pricing or just all the offsets. but i guess what i'm trying to get a sense for is just on that -- on those rolling offset, when do you think you hit run rate -- your run rate achievement of those assets? is that a middle of next next year type of timeline or is it more realistic to think that it progresses all the way through and it's not until the closer to the end of '22 where you hit the full offset run rate? just trying to get a sense or the magnitude pacing of your effort?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean obviously, i mean a lot depends on the future cost environment to on this. i mean, we put in the pricing in the u.s. to -- this is going to partially hit in the fourth quarter, like we said last quarter. the full impact is going to be in 2022. now if cost continue to accelerate, we'll have to address that with other actions. but i think it's speculative at this point to try to call '22, and the timing by quarters and by halves.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, ok, fair enough. can i ask just a cleanup on tax and appreciating the three benefits you've now realized in '21 and i'm not asking for '22. on a normalized basis, how should we think about your the tax run rate for the business going forward? if there is any color on the cash taxes versus versus gaap taxes that would be great as well?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, it's a great question obviously, and we talked about the facts here at our 10-q disclosures amount. we talk about kind of underlying rate of 24% to 25% based on the country mix, underlying tax rates that we have and our expectations for the year. and generally what happens and what happened this quarter, they are discrete programs our tax team runs. there are acquisitions in the past that we clean up some of the assumptions or estimates or there's stack due to limitations that drop off where we've tended to realize in discrete tax benefits. so that is what happened this quarter. but under the current tax regime with [indecipherable] all these things, globally it's 24% to 25%. obviously, we're all waiting to see what happens in washington to see what future rates are. and i'd say our cash taxes are pretty close to that too. we pay our fair share.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much.
operator
our next question is from the line of rob dickerson with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you. just wanted to touch on private label for a second, given i think you still operate that side of the business a bit as well as brands, obviously there's been terms ongoing discussion kind of where state of that overall industry and as we trying to get through the pandemic, so i'm just curious that given some of the comments around let's say trade inventory not exactly where you want it to be going for date and did a pricing forthcoming, i'm just kind of curious what you've seen or heard in the retailers as of late around demand for kind of your private label products versus brands and then just kind of how you think about price gaps as you kind of enter this pricing phase? that's my first, thanks.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
generally across all categories private label has lost share through the pandemic [technical issues] as the group have gained and in the recent results that we just announced our brands were strong, private labels were the soft point. when it comes to pricing, that costs are going up for every raw materials, packaging, labor and transportation, and that applies to private label as well. and so the pricing actions that were going forward [technical issues] include the private label products that we've been factoring. and i would expect that in many cases just because they are priced at a lower price point that they may see a higher percentage inflation rate because the same is our cost flow through. it's going to be a bigger percentage.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and then just quickly. we've obviously heard from a lot of food companies that so far u.s., typically measures look great relative to history given some of this elevated demand. i'm just curious, again i know you're not giving '22 guidance, but you have to have some thoughts that sort of what you might be baking in on the elasticity side? kind of what i'm hearing is if there is growth expected in both segments next year and pricing come in, i'm kind of assuming that the answer here is that there could be some incremental distribution gains to offset some elasticity, demand remains elevated. but just kind of any comments around that kind of volume side versus the price side where you think elasticity could shake up? thanks.
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. the demand remains elevated. our categories that we're already growing before the pandemic and need to grow through it and there is -- we've talk endlessly about the underlying demand for flavor growing, the younger consumers are fueling that and as we gone through the pandemic, we've gained household penetration, the usage rates are up and we haven't talked about it much but we -- i think we had a comment about it in the prepared remarks that the purchases per purchase occasion are up a lot and so consumers are buying more of of our products and we expect that to continue to be the case. so let's say our [technical issues] continues to be positive for the strong sales growth and if you look at consensus sales for next year that are out there, they're pretty anemic. and i guess we're trying to gently suggest that there is a reason to reconsider that.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right, thank you. it's very helpful, lawrence. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our final question is a follow-up from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your questions.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, just very quickly. lawrence, i think you quantified on a two-year basis americas shipments up 13%, consumption up 19%. and doesn't that also include your private label business being down in that two-year period, so therefore the gap isn't really 600 basis points, it might be a little bit less?
lawrence e. kurzius -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a very small number overall compared to our branded portfolio, the change is definitely less than 1% differential.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
less than 1%. okay, thanks for the math.
operator
thank you. at this time, i will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.

lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, kasey. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. starting on slide 4.
our fourth quarter completed another year of robust and sustained growth. in 2021, we remained focused on growth, performance and people, driving another year of strong results and continuing our momentum. we drove record sales growth by executing on our long-term strategies, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities, all while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing global environment. the profit driven by our strong sales growth in 2021, while tempered by the well-known headwinds of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, was also strong.
our 2021 operating performance underscored the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. we have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures and did so again in the fourth quarter. and we expect to do the same through this inflationary environment using pricing and other levers to fully offset cost pressures over time. the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio ideally position us to fully knowing demand for flavor around the world and drive continued differentiated growth.
this has never been more evident than over the last two years as consumers adapted to the ever-changing environment. our compelling offerings in our consumer and flavor solutions segment for every retail and customer strategy across all channels create a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive growth and consistency in our performance. it also gives us significant flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, wherever they may arise, and continue on our growth trajectory. this is a significant differentiator in the dynamic environment in which we currently operate.
we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion regardless of whether the occasion is consumed at home or away from home through our products and our customers' products. we are end-to-end flavor. now turning to slide 6 and our fourth quarter results. our performance was at the high end of the guidance range we provided for sales and adjusted operating profit on our last earnings call and exceeded the guidance range we provided for adjusted earnings per share.
on our top line versus the year-ago period, we grew fourth quarter sales 11%. both of our segments delivered strong growth with contributions from base business growth, driven by higher volume and pricing actions as well as new products and acquisitions. our fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share both increased 6%, driven by growth from higher sales and cci-led cost savings, partially offset by cost inflation. let's turn to our fourth quarter segment business performance, which includes some comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which we believe are meaningful, given the level of demand volatility from quarter to quarter experienced in 2020.
starting on slide 7. consumer segment sales grew 10%, including incremental sales from our cholula acquisition. the increase was driven by strong volume growth and the impact of pricing actions phased in during the quarter as we discussed on our last earnings call. our consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpace its pre-pandemic level.
our americas sales growth was 13% in the fourth quarter, with incremental sales from our cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. our total mccormick u.s. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%, following a 17% consumption increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a two-year basis. as we previously discussed, in the year-ago period, elevated demand challenged our supply chain whereas in 2021 with the actions we took to add capacity and increase resilience, we were far better positioned and able to ship in line with consumption.
demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our u.s. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. shelf conditions are improving as is our share performance with another sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, as we expected. we continue to see further improvement in our recent performance as we begin 2022.
importantly, and as i just mentioned, we are better positioned than we were a year ago and are confident in our continued momentum. focusing further on our u.s. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the fourth quarter of 2019 was the seventh consecutive quarter that our u.s. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the two-year ago period.
our key categories also continued to outpace the center-of-store growth rates versus the two-year ago period. household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. and when consumers shop, they are buying and therefore using more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. now turning to emea.
during the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. for the full year, we gained market share in key categories and across the region. similar to the u.s., our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the two-year ago period. and when consumers shop, they are buying more than they were pre-pandemic.
and in the asia pacific region, our fourth quarter performance continued to reflect the recovery of china's lower branded foodservice sales last year as well as consumer consumption growth across the region. turning to slide 9. our flavor solutions segment grew 14%, reflecting higher base volume growth in new products as well as pricing actions to partially offset cost inflation and contributions for our fona and cholula acquisitions. on a two-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions.
in the americas, our fona and cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our fourth quarter growth. additionally, we continued to see robust growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers as well as the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers as more dining out options are open versus a year ago. we continued to execute on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products in the region, both through the addition of fona and cholula to our portfolio as well as the exit of some lower-margin business. turning to emea, which has continued its strong momentum.
we are winning in all channels with double-digit fourth quarter growth to quick-service restaurants or qsrs, branded foodservice customers and packaged food and beverage customers. recovery has been robust in the away-from-home part of the portfolio, and growth in our at-home offerings has been outstanding. notably, for the full year, on a two-year basis, we have driven 19% constant currency growth across the portfolio. in apz, our momentum with our qsr customers remained strong, driving double-digit growth versus 2020 as well as on a two-year basis.
as for the fourth quarter and in line with what we have said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter to quarter. moving from our fourth quarter results. i'm pleased to share highlights of our full fiscal year, including an update on our cholula and fona acquisitions, starting on slide 10. we drove record sales growth in 2021, growing sales 13% to $6.3 billion with strong organic sales growth and a 4% contribution from our cholula and fona acquisitions.
notably, on a two-year basis, we grew sales 18%, reflecting a robust and sustained growth momentum in both of our segments. our consumer segment sales growth of 9% was driven by consumer sustained preference for cooking more at home fueled by our brand marketing, strong digital engagement and new products, as well as growth from cholula. versus 2019, we grew sales 20%, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands. our flavor solutions segment growth of 19% reflected the strong continued momentum with the at-home products in our portfolio, including a record year of new product growth and a robust recovery from last year's lower demand for away-from-home products as well as contributions from fona and cholula.
notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and away-from-home products in our portfolio. on a two-year basis, we grew sales 15%, driven by the at-home part of our portfolio with demand for the away-from-home portion recovering to pre-pandemic levels. we have consistently driven industry-leading sales growth resulting in mccormick being named to the latest fortune 500. we're proud of our sustained performance and for being included in this prestigious group of industry-leading companies.
at year end, our board of directors announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our 36th consecutive year of dividend increases. we have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. finally, we continue to be recognized for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. during the year, mccormick was named the united nations global compact lead company and awarded the inaugural terra carta seal from his royal highness, the prince of wales, for our industry leadership in creating a sustainable future.
and just last week, corporate knights ranked mccormick in their 2022 global 100 sustainability index as the world's 14th most sustainable corporation, and for the sixth consecutive year, no. 1 in the food products sector. moving to the one-year anniversary of our two fantastic recent acquisitions. cholula and fona are creating value, achieving synergies and delivering results according to our plans.
importantly, we've achieved our one-year sales and earnings per share accretion expectations for both cholula and fona. i'd like to share some comments about the successful execution of our growth plans. and then in a few moments, mike will cover in more detail our delivery on acquisition plans. starting with cholula on slide 12.
the addition of this beloved iconic brand with authentic mexican flavor is accelerating the growth of our global condiment platform. in our consumer segment, we're unlocking cholula's significant growth potential by using our category management expertise, leveraging e-commerce investments, launching new products, and optimizing brand marketing spend. we executed on initiatives this past year, including optimizing shelf placement and assortment; expanding into new channels; gaining momentum in e-commerce where cholula had been under-penetrated; increasing awareness, both through brand marketing investments and brand partnerships such as with doordash; and leveraging promotional scale across mccormick brands. we are excited about the results our initiatives are yielding.
during 2021, we gained significant momentum on top of lapping elevated growth in 2020, adding over one million new households and growing cholula's consumption 13% in 2021 versus last year. cholula is continuing to outpace category growth and gain share. combined with 19% total distribution point growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, it is clear our plans are driving accelerated growth. and notably, we drove cholula to the no.
2 hot sauce brand in the u.s., joining frank's redhot, the no. 1 ranked brand, at the top of the category. we are just as excited about cholula's performance as part of our flavor solutions portfolio. with our broad presence across foodservice channel, we have strengthened cholula's go-to-market model through 2021.
we continued to build on cholula's strong front-of-house presence, which builds trial and brand awareness beyond foodservice with significant double-digit growth of portion control packs as more restaurant meals are now consumed as delivery or takeaway. leveraging our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, we've also driven double-digit growth in our back-of-house foodservice penetration through recipe inspiration and increasing cholula's menu participation. we are growing with big national accounts and smaller independent restaurants, as well as expanding distribution through leveraging the strength of our distributor relationships where cholula was less developed. we are succeeding with new menu items, including both permanent ones and limited time offers.
our momentum with cholula is very strong. and we are confident our initiatives will continue to build on consumers' growing passion for heat and drive further growth of this fantastic brand. now turning to fona. the addition of this leading north american flavor manufacturer is accelerating the growth of our global flavors platform.
we are thrilled our first year of owning fona has been a record year for the business, with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. beverages, with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category, continued to drive significant growth for fona up 15% compared to last year. fona's new product wins and its pipeline potential have also hit record high, fueling future growth. we are continuing to drive growth and create new opportunities with our global footprint.
we are leveraging giotti's infrastructure to expand fona's flavors into the emea region. in our apz region, the combination of our infrastructure, which includes our recent flavor capability investments in china and fona's local application and flavor creation talent is unlocking further potential to accelerate flavor growth in that region. and just a few months ago, we began our expansion of fona's footprint to increase our americas flavor manufacturing capacity, an investment we planned as part of our acquisition model, enabling us to deliver the future growth we expect. by expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale as well as increasing our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our collective customers with a more comprehensive product offering and fueling more opportunities for growth across our entire portfolio.
we are cross-selling products across our customer base, and we've also realized the benefit of our combination within our own portfolio. for instance, with fona now leveraging mccormick's usda savory flavors and developing flavors for pet food applications. the combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to participate on briefs that capitalize on core strength across mccormick and fona, enabling us to build a robust pipeline of opportunities, and importantly, win and grow with our customers. we are thrilled with both cholula and fona.
our enthusiasm for these acquisitions, as well as our confidence that we will continue to achieve our plan, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only continued to strengthen. in summary, for 2021, we continued to capture the momentum we have gained in our consumer segment and the at-home part of our flavor solutions segment. we have successfully navigated through the pandemic-related disruption in the away-from-home portion of our flavor solutions segment, and cholula and fona have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. all of this reinforces our confidence for continued growth in 2022.
global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great, fast-growing categories and will continue to differentiate our performance. we are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio, and the successful execution of our strategies, sustainably positions us for future growth.
in this current dynamic and fast-paced environment, we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. as i mentioned earlier, we continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges similar to the rest of the industry. to partially offset rising costs, we raised prices where appropriately last year and began to realize the impact of those actions in our fourth quarter sales growth. as costs have continued to accelerate, we are raising prices again where appropriate in 2022.
these pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our cci-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. throughout our history, we have grown and compounded our growth regardless of short-term pressures and plan to do so again in 2022 as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. across our consumer segment, our 2022 plans include continuing to build consumers' confidence in the kitchen, inspire their home cooking and flavor exploration, and accelerate flavored usage, including delivering on the global demand for heat.
we also plan to strengthen our consumer relationships at every point of purchase as well as create delicious, healthy, and sustainable future. with our investments in brand marketing, category management and new products, we expect to drive further sales growth. for our flavor solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2022. our plans include targeting opportunities to grow with our customers at attractive, high-growth categories, continuing to leverage our broad technology platform to develop clean and natural solutions that taste great and strengthening our leadership in heat.
with our culinary-inspired innovation and our passion for creating a flawless customer experience, we plan to continue our new product momentum and drive further sales growth. our achievements in 2021, our effective growth strategies, as well as our robust operating momentum, all bolster our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. we're looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2022 growth plan in just a few weeks at cagny. in summary, we have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate through this ever-changing environment, responding with agility to volatility and disruptions, while remaining focused on the long-term objectives, strategies, and values that have made us so successful.
we are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. a combination of our strong business model, the investments we've made, the capabilities we've built, and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top line growth and margin expansion. our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever.
mccormick's employees around the world have done a tremendous job of navigating this past year's volatile environment. their agility, teamwork, and passion for flavor drive our momentum and success, and i want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. now i'll turn it over to mike.

thanks, and good morning, everyone. before i provide additional remarks on our fourth quarter and full year results, i would like to build upon lawrence's comments on cholula and fona and highlight how we have delivered on our acquisition plans now that we have completed the first year. starting on slide 19. as lawrence already shared, we have created value by driving sales growth according to our plans.
in addition, cholula was margin accretive to the gross and operating margins in both of our segments and fona was accretive to the margins in the flavor solutions segment. we are delivering against our synergy and onetime cost estimates, in fact, doing better than our acquisition plan. starting with our original synergy targets. for cholula, we have achieved the targeted $10 million to be fully realized by 2022.
for fona, we are on track to achieve our targeted $7 million by the end of 2023. we are also achieving revenue synergies as expected. our transaction and integration costs for cholula and fona are both lower than our acquisition plans. early in 2021, we took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following the acquisitions, raising $1 billion through the issuance of five-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes, and therefore, realized lower interest expense than we originally projected.
additionally, our ongoing amortization expense is favorable to both of the acquisition models. in summary, we executed our year one acquisition plans in line with, and in some areas, better than our modeled including the adjusted earnings per share accretion we expected. successful acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy. importantly, we have a proven track record of driving value through acquisitions and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, and cholula and fona are adding to that history.
now for our fourth quarter and full year performance, starting on slide 20. our fourth quarter capped off a year of record sales growth. during the fourth quarter, we grew constant currency sales 10%, with higher volume and product mix. acquisitions and pricing each contributing to the increases in both segments.
our organic sales growth was 6%, driven by strong growth in both the consumer and flavor solutions segments. and incremental sales from our cholula and fona acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. versus the fourth quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency with both our consumer and flavor solutions segments growing double digits. during the fourth quarter, our consumer segment sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix, pricing actions and a 2% increase from our cholula acquisition.
the year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the americas and asia/pacific regions. compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales grew 14% in constant currency, led by the americas. on slide 21, consumer segment sales in the americas increased 13% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as the sustained shift to at-home consumption continues to drive increased demand as well as lapping last year's capacity constraints. pricing actions and a 3% increase from the cholula acquisition also contributed to sales growth.
compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales increased 19% in constant currency, driven by broad-based growth across branded products as well as an increase from the cholula acquisition. a decline in private label sales partially offset the branded growth. in emea, constant currency consumer sales declined 5% from a year ago due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. on a two-year basis, sales increased 5% in constant currency driven by growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauce and mustard.
consumer sales in the asia/pacific region increased 11% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales in china or away-from-home products and higher sales of cooking at-home products across the region. compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales were flat with growth across the region offset by a sales decline in india due to the exit of some lower-margin business. turning to our flavor solutions segment on slide 24. we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 12%, including a 7% increase from our fona and cholula acquisitions.
the year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the americas and emea regions. compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, flavor solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency. in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 13% year over year, with fona and cholula contributing 11%. organic sales growth was driven by the recovery of demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies, with strength in snack seasonings and pricing.
on a two-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019, driven by higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business in other parts of the portfolio. in emea, constant currency sales grew 16% compared to last year due to increased sales to qsrs and branded foodservice customers, as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. constant currency sales increased 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and qsr customers. in the asia/pacific region, flavor solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, both driven by qsr growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities.
as seen on slide 28, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the cholula and fona acquisitions as well as special charges, increased 6% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period with minimal impact from currency. adjusted operating income in the consumer segment increased 14%, or in constant currency, 13%. the higher sales and cci-led cost savings more than offset cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges. brand marketing investments, as planned, were 10% lower in the quarter, following an 18% consumer segment increase in the fourth quarter of last year.
for the full year, we increased our brand marketing investments 3%. in the flavor solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 16% or 15% in constant currency. higher sales and cci-led cost savings were more than offset by the cost pressures in this segment, unfavorable product mix and costs related to supply chain investments. across both segments, incremental investment spending for our erp program was offset by lower covid-19 costs compared to last year.
as seen on slide 29, adjusted gross profit margin declined 150 basis points, driven primarily by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the phase-in of our pricing actions. our selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 70 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth and the reduction in brand marketing i just mentioned. these impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 80 basis points, as we had expected. for the fiscal year, adjusted gross profit margin declined 140 basis points, primarily driven by the cost pressures we experienced in the second half of the year and the lag in pricing.
adjusted operating income grew 6% in constant currency with the consumer segment's adjusted operating income increasing 1% and the flavor solutions segment 23%. both segments were driven by higher sales and cci-led cost savings, partially offset by cost pressures and incremental strategic investment spending. adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points for the fiscal year, driven by the adjusted gross profit margin decline. turning to income taxes.
our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3%, compared to 22.9% in the year-ago period. both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.1%, comparable to 19.9% in 2020. adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5% for the full year.
the elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest impacted both comparisons unfavorably. our adjusted income from operations was also unfavorably impacted by the elimination of ongoing income from eastern condiments following the sale of our minority stake earlier this year. for the fiscal year, this was partially offset by strong performance from our mccormick de mexico joint venture. at the bottom line, as shown on slide 32, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.84 from $0.79 in the year-ago period.
and for the year, adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $3.05 for fiscal year 2021. the increases for both comparisons were driven by higher adjusted operating income attributable to strong sales growth. on slide 33, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. our cash flow from operations for the year was $828 million.
the decrease from last year was primarily due to the higher use of cash associated with working capital and the payment of transaction and integration costs. the working capital comparison includes the impact of higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues as well as buffer against cost volatility. we've returned $363 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $278 million for capital expenditures in 2021. our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe.
for example, our new u.k. flavor solutions manufacturing facility, our erp business transformation, additional hot sauce capacity in the u.s. and our new u.s. northeast distribution center.
in 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2021 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. we expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. now turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 34.
we are well positioned for another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. we are projecting strong top line and operating performance with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. we also expect there will be an estimated one percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. on the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%.
as lawrence mentioned, we are taking further pricing actions in 2022, and as a result, expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth. we expect volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by our pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio.
our 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. this adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and cci-led cost savings. as a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. we do not margin up.
this has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. we expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in covid-19-related costs and our continuing investment in erp business transformation. this projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid-teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. our cost savings target reflects the challenges of realizing commodity and packaging cost savings in the current inflationary environment.
importantly, we believe there continues to be a long runway to achieve cost savings in 2022 and beyond. based on the expected timing of certain items, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. our additional 2022 pricing actions are expected to be phased in during the second quarter. cost inflation will have a more significant impact in the first half of 2022 as cost pressures accelerated in the back half of last year.
we also expect our erp investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021. as a reminder, we are also lapping a very strong business performance in the first quarter of 2021. our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. this outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3%.
our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating profit growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind i just mentioned. this results in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22 compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. in summary, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies to drive another year of strong growth and performance.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 35. we drove record sales growth in 2021. our strong operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the resilience of our employees. we achieved our one-year cholula and fona acquisition plans.
cholula and fona have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. we have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures on driving growth, as we did in the fourth quarter. mccormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of the environment. we have a strong foundation, we are in attractive categories and we're capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor.
we are confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum, and effective growth strategies, we will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. now let's turn to your questions.

we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your questions. 
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, everybody. good morning. i guess to start off, mccormick is essentially guiding to an on-algorithm year in what has obviously been described as a still pretty difficult industrywide operating environment.
i was hoping you could walk us through maybe some of really the key puts and takes in a little more detail that provide you with the visibility to achieve this. and maybe what i'm getting at is more detail on the dynamics still very much at play, as you mentioned, some of them in your first quarter. i think, basically, investors are trying to get a better handle on sort of the achievability of the full year in light of all of the difficult dynamics that are playing out in 1q to try and get a sense of just how back end loaded the year is, and again, your level of visibility there. so any more detail on that would be helpful.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
great. thanks, andrew. well, first of all, i don't think anyone should be openly surprised by the top line guidance. i think at the end of the third quarter, we indicated that we expect it to grow in 2022 and tried to indicate that we thought everyone's outlook for us was a bit pessimistic.
and you can see that we have a pretty upbeat view of where our sales are going. the underlying trends that support our business that we talked about in our prepared remarks are strong. the demand for flavor is not cyclical or obsolesced or pandemic related, but it's undergirded by real demographics with older generations fueling that demand. and we think that the consumption -- the shift in consumption at home that has happened in recent years is just a continuation of a long-term trend that supports our business from an underlying standpoint.
and all the things that we do in our strategies for brand building and so on continue to be supportive of growth. the year also includes a significant impact on the top line from pricing, which may be underestimated previously. and so that's going to factor into it. i guess the shape of the year, our fourth quarter is always the strongest part of the year.
the first quarter is also always the smallest part, and that may be compounded a bit this year by the fact that really the full impact of our pricing actions won't have gone into effect in the first quarter. the pricing actions that we took last year, of course, are in effect now, but the next round of pricing won't go into effect until as we -- till as we go through the second half -- till as we go through the second quarter and that's going to affect both the top line and the bottom line. i'll pass it over to mike now for some comments on operating profit.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. just to highlight a little bit to getting that on sales in the first quarter, we're really comparing against a really strong first quarter of last year, where consumer was up really dramatically. so there's going to be a bit of a segment mix challenge in the first quarter. talking about the first half also, cost -- as pricing will grow during the year, costs, though, which we talked about in mid-teens increase will be in effect in the first quarter.
there will be a tough comparison there, too, because the pricing won't offset that. if you remember back to last year, we had low single-digit inflation earlier in last year that rose to the high single digit at the end of the year. now at mid-single teens, that's a tough comp for the first quarter primarily and a bit in the first half. the other thing we have also is the erp spend we talked about, and we can talk about that later a little bit.
but the timing of that -- last year, we had some minimal spending in q1 also. so a bunch of drivers that we think the profit will be back loaded in the year would be a bit of a tough comp in q1.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then i guess, lastly, with mid-teens inflation expected for the full year, sort of would suggest maybe, call it, high single-digit pricing would be needed to sort of protect profit dollars. and i guess that would imply maybe closer to maybe a mid-single-digit decline in volume for the year. is that kind of broadly the right way to think about the balance? and what does that suggest in terms of elasticity and sort of comparing to historic levels? i think you mentioned you're building in some elasticity, of course, as more pricing kicks in, but maybe not to the extent that you've seen historically.
if you could just give us a sense of what's driving that thought process?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. sure, andrew. i think that you've got the, at a high level, the shape right, but maybe too extreme on the end. i think that to characterize pricing, including the wrap from last year, to be more in the mid- to high range and for the volume impact at a total company level to be more flattish to low single-digit decline.
we have modeled in elasticity, but not at the rates that we have seen historically. but i do think that we're in new and uncharted territory versus all of the elasticity models, at least from the actions that we've taken so far. we assumed lower price elasticity and that's what we seem to be experiencing. if anything, we may be seeing slightly even less elasticity than we've assumed.
but we're conscious that with more than one price increase coming in, in a relatively short timeframe, that there may be a cumulative effect. so we have modeled in price elasticity. mike, do you want to elaborate on that at all, if you have anything to add?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. i think you have covered it well.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks very much, everybody. 
operator
our next question is from the line of ken goldman with j. p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay. morning. sorry. i was on mute.
thanks so much. you're guiding to operating profit growing 200 basis points faster than sales, which is, of course, normal as per your algo. but i think, typically, you might expect gross margins to be a positive driver toward that, and this year, they might be a slight negative. so i guess the burden to grow operating profit falls harder on sg&a savings or leverage than usual this year.
and i kind of just wanted to quickly go over the drivers of your confidence that sg&a can be this helpful. i mean we do have marketing growing at a slower pace than sales, i appreciate that. and you, of course, have lower covid costs there. but i was under the impression you'd also have maybe erp implementation cost kind of offsetting those covid cost reductions.
you did mention cci savings will be less of a tailwind. so forgive the lengthy question, but i'm just not quite sure i get why operating income will be up so much unless there's something in the sg&a efficiencies that i'm just quite not getting yet.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's a good question, ken. i'll start off. you highlighted exactly what we're seeing. a&p is up low single digits.
we're continuing to invest in the business. other sg&a is kind of flattish if you think about it. in a high -- we gave you our cci number. and in a year where cci is down versus the previous year because of the toughness of getting through cci reductions and things like packaging costs and commodity costs, sg&a, there's -- we're driving hard on sg&a from a cci perspective so you should see positives there.
covid cost didn't only hit the gross margin line. there were covid costs in the distribution side of things, which will go away in 2022. we're taking discretionary actions to really -- in a high-cost environment, we're doing the prudent things to make sure we can make our numbers. and i would say things like incentive comp, we've had two really strong years of that.
and we budget toward hitting our targets and we'd love to exceed it, but that is a part of the comparison too also.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
there's other stuff on there too with the high top line growth and the flattish sg&a, that even with gross margin flat to slightly down, in that range, it's kind of -- you're going to get operating leverage that's going to drop through. 
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. no. that's helpful. thank you.
and then quickly, i wondered if you can update us, maybe you said it and i didn't quite hear it, but where your customer inventories stand today as you estimate them to be versus what might be considered normal. and if your outlook, to any extent, assumes that any kind of inventory refill takes place this year. i know we've been waiting for something like this for all of our companies for a long time. i'm just curious what you're modeling there.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, we have not restocked our customers to the extent that we would have hoped in 2021. we had started to make some progress on that. and we ran into the same kind of supply chain disruptions that many of our peers and others and other industries have talked about. and so we actually pulled down customer inventories again in q3.
and in q4, with the high elevated demand, even though our supply chain was in much better condition, we were really able to ship to the consumption rather than restocks. so we think that there's still some restocking of customer inventories still to be done. i mean your own experience would probably tell you that if you went into the store, the conditions still aren't perfect, the backrooms and distribution channels, likewise, still have some gaps. so there's still more work to do in that area.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i live in new york city. the state of grocery stores here is always at a low level. so it's kind of hard to tell what's bad versus what's normal.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
sure. i will say, i don't want those comments to be misunderstood, i think that we saw a peak disruption of our supply chain in q4 and we've seen steady improvement since then. some of the feedback we've gotten from our larger customers is that we're in much better shape than some of our peer companies.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your questions.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. one follow-up for mike. is it fair to say that your covid costs will be a benefit in 2022 of $60 million just comparing to $21 million? and then how do i compare that to erp costs? are your erp costs going to be higher in 2022 compared to '21? can you give us a rough estimate? and then secondly, on private label.
if you look back into history, private label does gain a lot of share during inflationary periods, especially in your category. can you talk about what you've seen from your customers' demand for private label heading into 2022? and how do you expect it to perform in '22 in a rising price environment?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
rob, i'll take the first part of that and lawrence will take the second. first, great question. covid cost and erp are big drivers on our p&l. covid costs, we did talk about how two years ago we spent $50 million; last year, $60 million.
if you remember, we've highlighted a large chunk of that was co-packing cost. so as we -- our supply chain has improved over last year in the fourth quarter. we've eliminated most of those costs. but we still have underlying costs that, frankly, we're not treating as covid cost anymore.
we're treating it as an ongoing business cost of labor, premium pay, things like that. there has been a continue into the future. so i'm not going to give you an exact number. it's not $60 million.
the significant part of that is going away in '22. relating to erp. if you remember from our third quarter call last year, we were talking about it at the time a decrease in covid costs -- we expected a decrease in covid costs in '22 offset by an increase in the erp costs. that being said, what we're saying now is we're still spending significant amounts on erp in '22.
we spent -- we had talked last year about spending in '21 around $50 million. '21 came in a little heavier than that. and in 2022, we're going to -- it's not a significant headwind, but it's still a significant investment. i'd say it's up slightly.
wasn't big enough to mention in our guidance. now what has changed since three months ago? one, elevated and strong demand. we're really happy with that demand. as we went through our planning process, which we always do in the fall, the combination of that elevated demand -- and as you know, our fourth quarter is really important to us and we have planned on significant go-lives in 2022.
one, to protect our customer service and to make sure we are prudent. the go-lives would have slid into the fourth quarter because you have to build inventories and things like that to get ready for these major go-lives. we made the decision to slide those major go-lives out into 2023. the end result of all those moves is roughly between '21, '22 and '23, it's about the same level of spend.
so it's very smooth. it kind of eliminates that noise between years, which would help you look at our underlying growth of operating profit over that time. but we're still really excited about the erp investment, but we just made the decision as i just talked about.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
rob, so far, first of all, for the last couple of years, private label has actually underperformed in the category. you even heard on our remarks that although our fourth quarter was strong, the private label portion of it was actually not a contributor to that strength. and we're really not seeing consumers move to private label in our categories. and in fact, it's really moved more to brands than to private label.
in past times when there's been a recessionary environment, and i don't know that we're expecting a recession in 2022, but even in times that were more economically tough our products have done very well. our products contribute pennies, a fraction of the cost of a meal and are actually part of the consumers' way to manage their total inflation basket. i mean if meat is going up 40%, one way you can stretch your grocery dollar is to buy less expensive cuts and use more herbs and spices and our recipe with it. so actually, we tend to do pretty well both in good and bad economic times.
and i'm confident that we've got a portfolio of products that touches the consumer at every price point. i know in our internal discussions around pricing, we've been very conscious of the lower income consumers and how to make sure that we're still able to meet their needs for flavor.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. got it. thank you. 
operator
our next question is from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your questions.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning, everyone. yes. so i guess my first question maybe is around the fourth quarter and really turning to the flavor solutions business.
and i guess the operating profit and margin performance in that business, it contrasted pretty sharply with consumer and i know this is a big consumer quarter. but maybe if you could just talk about some of the profit and margin drivers in flavor solutions in the fiscal fourth quarter? and maybe in the '22 outlook, how we should think about the relative segment performance between consumer and flavor solutions versus your total company? 
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
adam, this is mike. i'll take that. yes. fourth quarter, flavor solutions did have a bit of margin pressure.
i mean similar to consumer, obviously, the cost last year came ahead of our pricing actions. so that did -- obviously, that impacted flavor solutions. but as we catch up into the first quarter and second quarter, that should be solved. but they did increase very quickly for us.
i mean there's pass-throughs, contractual agreements. so there's timing elements to a lot of our flavor solutions business. that being said, one of the -- you've seen also the great volume growth and sales growth we've had in flavor solutions over the past couple of years, and we're making strategic investments such as the u.k. flavor manufacturing plant.
those investments have costs associated with them. so in the fourth quarter, as we're starting to bring that plant live into next year and you should expect in early 2022 also a bit of a drag early in the year of flavor solutions, you'll see a bit of that due to the strategic investments of which the u.k. flavor manufacturing plant is just one. and we did have a little bit of unfavorable mix in the quarter.
even though we were pruning -- continue to prune some of our lower-margin business, there was a bit of a hard comparison versus 4q of last year. 
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'll say if there's an area where we still have some ongoing, i'd say, extraordinary costs, i'd say flavor solutions might be a little bit more impacted by that, where we've had -- just because of supply chain disruption and workforce disruption where we've had a bit more incremental cost for things like overtime premium pay and so forth.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just continuing in flavor solutions and i'm thinking about as part of the bridge in '22, right, at the company level, being tight on sg&a is clearly a key element of hitting the total company profit growth targets. in contrast in flavor solutions, a big part of the growth has been to remix the portfolio up into some of these higher-value segments, which obviously come with higher gross margins, but also typically will have a higher sg&a burden in terms of the r&d and the technical sales associated with that. just are you still able to make both the facility and the head count investments necessary on the flavor solutions side to support those -- the growth there?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
oh, definitely. i mean, i think, as i alluded, we're making those investments. and there will be timing impacts. like i said, first half of this with some of these investments for some of our strategic things.
but we recovered those things by the end of the year. and we feel very good about the ability and acquisitions like fona continue -- and the growth profile of those businesses give us more confidence over time of the positivity of those investments to flavor solutions.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
and then i'll just remind everybody, our flavor solutions tend to be a bit lumpy as well driven by the activities of some of our large customers.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. i'll pass it on. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel. please proceed with your question.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i have just a couple of questions for you here. i was just curious, the level of inflation that we're seeing this year, kind of mid-teens inflation, was more than i expected.
and i just want to get a sense of how much was it in 2021, what were you kind of up against this past year, just to get a sense of the kind of total amount of inflation. and then also just to understand, i don't know, i've heard it about, is there any more inflation in flavor solutions versus consumers or one is going to require more pricing as we move through the year?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, chris, it's mike. i'll answer that. i mean, last year, we started out the year, as you remember, low single digits and we transitioned into mid-single digits around -- i think around the third quarter call. in the fourth quarter call, we talked about the fourth quarter costs were up high single digits, which made the whole year high end of the mid-single-digit range is one of the key things i'm saying here.
so just to remind you where we were. this year is the mid-teens really driven by large commodity packaging and freight increases that we've all seen. from a flavor solutions versus consumer, they're both impacted by all this. i mean, ocean freight, which is a big item for us, as you think about our peers, we get a lot of our products from asia, other parts of the world where shipping containers and things like that, that ocean cost has gone up a lot.
that impacts both the consumer and the flavor solutions very equitably. other items like pepper, garlic, things like that, we use on both sides. so i'd say it's roughly the same overall materially.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. yes. that's helpful. thank you.
and the other question i had was just -- you talked a little bit before, i think it was to rob's question, about third party -- using third parties to manufacture your products and that kind of thing. it sounds like you've gotten out of a lot of that. and i know that was a gross margin drag throughout the past couple of years and i think a lot of what you call covid cost. so just to be clear, that's something that will largely go away in 2022? and i guess related to that -- well, go ahead.
go ahead.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. it's the incremental portion that's going to go away. we always have a certain couple co-packing and that makes sense for our business for a variety of reasons. i'd say, we're more in line with the historical level of co-packing.
it's that incremental co-packing at a time when everybody was looking for the capacity, that was -- that created all of those premium costs that we absorbed ourselves and -- which we've gotten out of the business.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. i guess what i'm hopefully getting to is, i guess, then, are you able to produce at the level of demand growth today? that's something that every company has been struggling with and i'm just curious kind of where mccormick stands on that now. i guess as you pull back on these incremental third parties you're indicating, you do have the internal capacity to meet demand, is that right?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. that is right, chris. and i would say that the challenge has always been in the americas, first of all. so we've been able to meet the demand throughout the entire pandemic in the rest of the world.
it's been an americas demand, we're just between the scale of the business and the sheer elevation of demand. and the fact that our capital investments had for the previous number of years been directed toward building capacity overseas, that left us a little under-invested in the u.s. it gave us a real challenge in the early days of the pandemic. but we've done an enormous amount of work to increase our u.s.
manufacturing capacity and confident that we've got the capacity to meet that demand. that's why that co-packing expense has gone away. that's a root of the improvement in our service to our customers, the restoration of product on the shelf, the recovery of share. this -- our supply chain has always been a competitive advantage from global sourcing to operating excellence.
and i'd say that although it will never be good enough to my satisfaction, it has come a long way and i say it's a competitive advantage again.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we continue to work with our vendors. we struggle with the same challenges that all of our peers have with supplying bottles and things like that. and there will be sporadic challenges along the way, but not broad-based.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks for your time.

our next question comes from the line of peter galbo with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thank you for taking the questions. mike, i guess we're getting some questions this morning just on trying to square the gross margin guidance just given the level of cost inflation, and i know you spoke about ocean freight and commodities.
i guess, one, is that cost inflation line just only pertinent to cost of goods? does it include outbound freight, which i think you guys captured in sg&a? and maybe how we should think about just the cadence of gross margin throughout the course of the year.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, first, outbound freight is considered cost of goods sold for us. so very similar to our peers. i mean, if you look at our gross margin, we're guiding comparable to down 50 basis points. the whole impact of pricing mid-single teens inflation is a big drag on that.
so we're thinking of a 250 basis point dilution just because of pricing to cover costs from a timing -- but that's offset. the good -- positives are cci savings, continuing to prune lower-margin business and the covid costs we've talked about previously. next year has a little bit of a segment mix headwind, as you know. and -- but i'd say from a timing perspective, as we talked about, the timing of our pricing coming in -- the second pricing impact in the second quarter, it will build during the year cost, which will be with us a full year.
so the first quarter will be heavily impacted, as we talked about, and the first half a bit of that, too. so it's a bit of a first half/second half play as we've talked about from a gross margin perspective.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'll also just chime in that we have great brands that we invest behind in most of our categories. in most of our markets, we're not only the share of voice leader in terms of speaking to the consumer, but in many cases, we have close to 100% of the share of voice. we've got a great position on the shelf. we have done a lot to build loyalty with consumers, keep our brands relevant and we believe that we've got the pricing power to pass these costs through and continue to drive growth in the future beyond that.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks very much. and lawrence, maybe just a separate question.
i know there's nothing in the at least initial outlook as it relates to m&a. but i think there's been some headlines, obviously, about some potential brands that could be nice adjacencies for you guys that could come to market. just how you're thinking about m&a this year, where maybe you think the target leverage ratio needs to be before you think about taking on another deal?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, there have certainly been some exciting headlines in what it's supposed to be a boring industry. so there is a lot going on out there. yes, i would say that we always are alert to strategic assets to which we apply our financial discipline. we've got a great track record of buying great assets and integrating them.
we're still coming off a fairly recent acquisition of two very good assets, cholula and fona, that have performed very well for us, but that we still have got to pay for. and so right now, our primary focus is on deleveraging and building more dry powder. i won't -- i'm not going to say never, but that's our primary focus right now.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks very much, guys. 
operator
thank you. our final question today comes from the line of rob dickerson with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
oh, great. thanks so much. good morning. so just to clarify, look, as we got through '20 and obviously fiscal '21, right, demand has been strong for in-home baking.
you benefited, obviously. i mean, it seems like, as you said, kind of in the call that elasticity models are probably a little bit all over the place just kind of given where we are in terms of strength in consumer and increasing prices. and so i mean, it sounds like your perspective from here is that consumption level, even with an increase in price and potentially, let's say, an increase in our ability as we get through the year, really shouldn't be kind of waning that much, right? like the feel demographically with the incremental purchase rate, let's say, repeat from millennials that even if prices go up, maybe private label doesn't take them much share and kind of overall demand seems to be somewhat stable. i just kind of want to get clarification on that demand piece just given mobility and trade down risk.
that's all.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. well, i mean i'm taking this as a primarily very u.s.-centric question. but we do expect that the shift in consumption to more cooking at home and that consumer behavior to stick to an extent. we've never said that all of it's going to stay.
but we do expect that a significant portion of that is going to stay and that this has been a step-up in our category. i mean consumers are still working from home, and it looks like work-from-home is going to be a permanent part of the work environment. our own proprietary research with consumers say that only a tiny fraction, i mean, less than 10% expect to cook less at home than they do now. most expect to cook more.
and so based on what we see happening in society, what consumers are saying and what we are still experiencing from elevated demand says that demand is going to continue to be strong. and i would just say also that we are in categories that we've chosen to be in that are strong to begin with. and there's been strong underlying growth of all of the flavor categories that we're in over time. and the increment that has happened from the shift in consumption during the last two years really has accelerated growth by maybe a year or two of those categories.
so it's not as extraordinary as everyone thinks. it just had that much to follow on.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. yes. that's fair. and then quickly, just, mike, just on free cash flow.
i think you said you expect it to be up year over year, kind of a good strong free cash flow year. capex seems to be up a little bit year over year, however. and then we saw free cash flow kind of down a little bit last year relative to the prior, call it, three, four years. so just when you say kind of good, strong free cash flow year, is that -- obviously, you're implying it's up year over year, but maybe it's a little bit more in line with the prior few years.
just trying to get a little bit more sense of clarity on kind of how you're viewing free cash flow, and that's it.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think that's fair, rob. i think this year, with the significant build in inventories to protect our customers and sales, some of the transaction costs we talked about earlier in the year from m&a has put a little drag on that. but as we see into the future, some of those things get solved.
so back to previous year levels, if it makes sense.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
makes sense. all right. great. thanks so much.

i will now turn the discussion over to lawrence.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. i'd like to start by welcoming brendan to this morning's call. in addition to his continuing role as president of our global consumer business, brendan now has responsibility for our business worldwide in his newly appointed role as president and coo.
at the end of our prepared remarks, i may ask him to weigh in on some of your questions. mccormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other volatility has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our financial objectives. broadly, our results in the second quarter were in line with our sales and profit expectations despite certain global challenges, including a greater-than-expected level of high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruption in china from covid-related lockdowns and the conflict in ukraine. as our second quarter progressed, the dynamics of these conditions intensified and negatively impacted our sales and profit results.
before discussing our second quarter results in more detail, i'd like to comment on each of these, starting on page 5. consistent with the rest of the industry, high cost inflation and supply chain are continuing challenges. to partially offset cost pressures, we've taken multiple pricing actions and, as planned, we are raising prices again. inflation continued to escalate, and we've adjusted our upcoming pricing actions accordingly.
we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our cci-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and reducing discretionary spend where possible. we expect our pricing actions and other levers to begin to outpace cost pressures late in the third quarter, with higher cost and higher offsetting pricing actions than we expected on our last call, which further weights our 2022 profit to the second half of the year. we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time.
in china, during the second quarter, there was significant unanticipated disruption in consumption due to severe covid-related lockdowns in shanghai and other cities throughout china. china is our second biggest sales country, with operations in shanghai, guangzhou and wuhan. our shanghai operation produces approximately 40% of our total china sales, which are distributed throughout the country and supports both of our segments. and as a reminder, our branded food service demand is included in our consumer segment in china.
the lockdowns lasted roughly 75 days, with our shanghai plant forced to close for two weeks at the onset, with employees living in the facility. once we were able to reopen, we were impacted by lockdown-related labor shortages due to workers being quarantined. during april and may, we incurred significant incremental manufacturing and transportation costs to supply our customers. in addition, as restaurants largely closed and consumers unable to shop for extended periods in our strongest geographies, we experienced significant demand softness as well.
market conditions in china have also allowed very little opportunity to increase prices. while we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in china, but we will not be able to recover the sales and profit impact we experienced in this fiscal year. finally, regarding the conflict in ukraine, in mid-march, we suspended operations in russia, and our operations in ukraine were paused. these countries account for less than 1% of our overall business.
we have recently decided to exit our consumer business in russia. now, for more detail on our second quarter results, starting with sales on slide 7. sales declined 1% from the second quarter of last year, including an unfavorable impact from currency. our constant-currency sales were comparable to last year, with growth from pricing actions offset by a decline in volume and product mix.
the volume decline was impacted unfavorably by several discrete items, including a 1% impact from the china consumption disruption and the conflict in ukraine i just mentioned, a 1% impact from the exit of low-margin business in india and a 2% impact from lapping the u.s. trade inventory replenishment during last year's second quarter. excluding these items, our sales performance would have been 4% growth, reflecting the strength of our broad global portfolio and effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions. while growth in both segments was impacted by the discrete items, they were more impactful to our consumer segment.
notably, our growth in flavor solutions was outstanding. comparisons to 2021 and 2020 remain difficult due to the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the second quarter of the last two years. using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, second quarter sales have grown at a constant currency compounded annual growth rate or cagr of 6%. moving to profit.
adjusted operating income was down 33% or 32% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share was down 30%. the adjusted operating income comparison includes 7% unfavorable impact from the disruption to china's consumption and the conflict in ukraine. although we anticipated the profit driven by sales growth in the second quarter would be more than offset by higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, the impact was greater than expected due to continuing cost escalation. while this pressured second quarter profit, we expect to mitigate this impact later this year.
now, moving to second quarter business updates for each of our segments. starting with our consumer segment on slide 9, our second quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions. in the americas, our first wave of pricing was phased in during our fourth quarter of last year, the second wave during the second quarter in april and the third wave will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. with the first wave, we saw a very low level of elasticity.
with the second wave, we are seeing more price elasticity, although still below historical levels. while consumer spending has remained strong, consumers are now under significant pressure for broad-based inflation, notably fuel prices and other macro factors. as we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. overall, our pricing actions in emea and apz are on track and our elasticity impacts are similar to the americas.
in emea and apz, pricing timing varies by market within each region. in some markets, particularly in emea, there are regulatory guidelines on when we take pricing, which generally creates a lag in the timing of pricing compared to the americas. in this unprecedented environment, however, we are taking additional actions in markets across emea. now for some further highlights by region, starting with the americas.
our total u.s. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%. and over the last three years, since 2019, and consumption has grown at a three-year cagr of 7%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. in the americas, a sales decline in the second quarter included the impact of lapping a 4% overshipment of consumption to replenish retailer inventories in the second quarter of last year.
our second quarter shipments this year were in line with our consumption change. demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. however, some products remain stressed by sustained high demand. shelf conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance of another quarter of share gain.
our spices and seasoning share was pressured during the quarter by the shortage of certain packaging materials as well as certain organic spices. some of these have been resolved and some will remain ongoing. we continue to use our category and revenue management capability to strengthen our spices and seasoning portfolio and optimize the category performance for both mccormick and our retailers. the strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we will begin to realize later this year.
in emea, we continue to have strong share performance in most categories and markets. during the second quarter, we lapped strong year-ago consumption, partially due to last year's covid-related restrictions throughout emea, where restrictions extended longer than other regions. our botany brand of homemade dessert products in france, a product line unique to our emea region, was most impacted as recently we've seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level. in other categories in the region, we believe there has been a step-up in consumption.
and in the asia pacific region, in addition to the consumption disruption in china, second quarter growth was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in india. at the end of last year, we decided to exit our rice business, the kohinoor brand, to enable the region to focus on our higher-margin core category. turning to flavor solutions on slide 10. our sales performance for the quarter was outstanding, with both pricing and volume growth contributing.
we drove double-digit growth in both the at-home and away-from-home parts of our portfolio. looking at our flavor solutions growth over the past three years, since the covid-19 restrictions caused dramatic second quarter comparisons in '20 and '21, our sales cagr is 8%, largely driven by volumes. our pricing actions increased sales in all three regions. broadly, pricing actions in the branded foodservice part of our portfolio followed the same cadence as those in each region in consumer business.
in the rest of our flavor solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows, with automatic price adjusters in many contracts and the timing is going to vary based on those windows. in this dynamic environment though, with costs escalating so quickly, we are having discussions outside of those windows and passing costs through faster than usual. higher volumes also contributed to growth in the americas and emea region. demand has remained strong for certain parts of our business in these regions.
our supply chain is being pressured to meet this demand and we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. we appreciate our customers working with us through this pressure. in the americas, where our customer base is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, our at-home customers, strong growth was driven by flavors for savory snacks as well as performance nutrition and health applications with these customers. in emea, our customer base is more skewed to quick service restaurants, or qsrs, and our strong qsr momentum contributed to growth in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution.
branded foodservice growth was strong in both the americas and emea regions, driven by restaurant and institutional food service customers. demand continues to strengthen in this channel, particularly as travel accelerates and restaurants benefit from consumers shifting to takeaway and delivery. overall, our flavor solutions sales demand and growth momentum continues to be strong. now, let me expand on our growth platform and positioning in the current environment.
turning to slide 11. global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. we are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, but the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate.
mccormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. with the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers products. we are end-to-end flavor. we continue to make investments to sustainably meet the growing demand and to fuel further growth.
in our global supply chain, we increased our capacity with our recently opened u.k. peterborough flavor solutions manufacturing facility and have begun our expansion of boneless footprint to support future flavor growth. we are also increasing our capacity in the fast-growing hot sauce category and investing in seasoning capacity to support increased demand and strengthen resiliency. as we've said, with the sustained level of high consumer demand, we're benefiting from the manufacturing capacity we've added.
while we still experienced disruptions in the supply chain, they are much more specific mainly from a transportation and packaging supply standpoint. we experienced the peak disruption in the third quarter of last year. and with every month, the supply chain continues to get better. we feel good about the progress we're making.
we are strategically investing behind our brands to drive growth, including in brand marketing, as we did throughout the pandemic with our three-year brand marketing cagr approximating our consumer segment sales cagr for the same period. we're pivoting our messaging to emphasize to consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars. for instance, we're launching a digital messaging highlighting the value of our product by making a great flavorful meal economically. we add flavor for only pennies per serving and recipes like our 30-minute taco casserole are family and budget-friendly answers to what's for dinner.
we continue to invest in new products. in our consumer segment, we are responding to new consumer behaviors, like increased at-home lunches. for instance, our new patent pending french's creamy mustard is off to a great start. we're sensitive to the needs of price-conscious consumers, not just in these challenging economic times, but every day.
our portfolio includes branded items to accommodate consumers' needs and provide solutions for everyone at every price point as well as private label products. our new product launches include additional entry-level price point product for affordability and larger sizes of key high usage items for better value. while we are still seeing strong consumer spending, we know that inflation is a significant concern for consumers, more so than covid. we're leveraging our proprietary research, which served us well during the pandemic, to monitor for any signals of changing behavior.
our research continues to indicate consumers are going to cook as much at home or more than they did during the pandemic for many reasons. one of them is that they find it more economical. to the extent there is a recession, it further reinforces cooking at home, and we know from our past sales performance that our categories and brands perform well during a recessionary period. now, for some summary comments on slide 13 before turning it over to mike.
we remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. we have grown and compounded that growth over the years regardless of the environment. the long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly gives us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate a challenging global environment.
despite the pressures we experienced in the second quarter, we are well positioned and confident in delivering strong performance in 2022 and beyond, while driving sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. mccormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. their agility and their teamwork drive our momentum and success, and i want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. and now, i'll turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone. starting on slide 15. our top-line constant-currency sales were comparable to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 7% growth from pricing actions, offset by a 7% decline in volume and product mix. excluding the 4% impact of the discrete item lawrence mentioned earlier, our sales performance would have reflected 4% growth.
consumer segment sales declined 7% in constant currency. the impact from lapping the u.s. trade inventory replenishment, the consumption disruption in china, the exit of low-margin business in india and the conflict in the ukraine contributed 6% to that decline. the remaining 1% decline was due to lower volume, partially offset by pricing actions.
on a three-year basis, our second quarter constant-currency sales cagr was 4%. on slide 16, consumer sales in the americas declined 4% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and mix, partially offset by pricing actions. this decline is attributable to lapping trade inventory replenishments in the second quarter of last year. over the past three years, constant-currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 7%.
in emea, constant-currency consumer sales declined 11%, primarily due to lapping high year-ago demand driven by covid-related lockdowns, the most significant impact of which was lower sales of vahine homemade dessert products. a 1% unfavorable impact from lower sales in russia and ukraine also contributed to the decline. pricing actions in all markets partially offset the lower volume. over the past three years, emea's constant-currency sales grew at a 3% cagr.
constant-currency consumer sales in the asia-pacific region declined 18%, including a 20% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in china as well as the exit of low-margin business in india. pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. on a three-year basis, apz's second quarter constant-currency sales cagr was a 7% decline, driven by the china and india impact i just mentioned. excluding this impact, sales grew at a 5% cagr over the past three years.
turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 19. we grew second quarter constant-currency sales 11% due to pricing actions as well as higher volume and mix. this growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in sales related to the combined impact of the china disruption and the conflict in ukraine. second quarter constant-currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% cagr.
in the americas, flavor solutions' constant-currency sales grew 12%, driven by both pricing and the combination of volume and mix. higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth, with higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing to growth. over the past three years, constant-currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 8%. in emea, we drove 19% constant-currency sales growth with a 14% increase in volume and mix and 5% related to pricing actions.
emea's flavor solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to the conflict in ukraine, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with qsr and branded foodservice customers. over the past three years, emea's constant-currency sales grew at a 10% cagr. in the asia-pacific region, flavor solutions sales declined 6% in constant currency. the decline was driven by a 7% impact from lower volume in china due to the covid-related restrictions, partially offset by pricing actions in all markets across the region.
apz grew constant-currency sales at a 3% cagr over the past three years. as seen on slide 23, adjusted gross profit margin declined 550 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period. realizing this is a sizable compression, i will spend a moment on the significant drivers. let me start with the drivers we anticipated.
first, nearly half of this decline, approximately 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. we focus on gross profit dollars. this impact was more significant than in the first quarter because of the higher level of pricing in the second quarter. product mix was unfavorable as compared to the second quarter of last year.
in our consumer segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are lapping strong u.s. spices and seasonings growth related to the inventory replenishment. in our flavor solutions segment, sales growth in our away-from-home products was higher than our at-home products and we are lapping strong sales of beverage flavors last year. a sales shift between our consumer and flavor solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix.
in our flavor solutions segment, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by start-up and dual running costs as we transitioned production to our new u.k. peterborough manufacturing facility. of note, cci-led cost savings partially offset the impacts i just walked through and we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. in addition to the net impact of the anticipated items i just detailed, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by the following items: as lawrence discussed, cost inflation and supply chain pressures escalated during the second quarter impacting our results more than expected, primarily related to transportation costs and faster-turning materials.
while we have adjusted our upcoming pricing actions to reflect that escalation and we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time, our second quarter gross margin compression reflects the usual lag associated with pricing. we expect pricing to begin outpacing the cost pressures later this year and continue into next year. our cost recovery will vary by region and segment. currently, our pricing lag is more significant in our flavor solutions segment.
lawrence previously mentioned we have incremental costs to meet strong demand for certain parts of our flavor solutions business, thus impacting our gross margin. and finally, as already mentioned, significant cost due to the covid-related restrictions in china had an unfavorable impact to profit. moving to slide 24. selling, general and administrative expenses were lower than the second quarter of last year and as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points.
the decline was driven by lower employee benefit and brand marketing expenses as well as discretionary spending reductions, partially offset by higher distribution costs. the decline in brand marketing investments was driven by china and russia reductions. importantly, across our other markets, we invested in brand marketing at a comparable level to last year. the net impact of the factors i just mentioned resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021.
in the consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 29%. and in the flavor solutions segment, it declined 40%. a 1% unfavorable impact from currency is included in each of these declines. turning to income taxes on slide 25.
our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6% compared to 22.2% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. at the bottom line, please turn on slide 26, second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. the decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. on slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet.
our cash flow from operations was $154 million through the second quarter of 2022 compared to $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. this decrease was primarily driven by lower net income. cash flow from operations will be weighted to the second half of the year, similar to our profit growth. we returned $198 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $102 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter.
we expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. now, turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 28. as a reminder, last quarter, the conditions in russia, ukraine and china were just unfolding and cost inflation and supply chain challenges remain dynamic and fast moving.
today, we have a better view of the macro environment and our guidance for the full year considers the greater impact from these items. in addition, and as noted previously, we have always expected our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. we now expect it to be even more so. we are projecting strong top-line growth with profit impacted by the global challenges i just mentioned.
we also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, an increase from our previous estimate of 1 percentage point unfavorable. on the top line, we now expect to grow constant-currency sales 5% to 7%. we expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing, which will accelerate significantly in the second half versus the first half. while we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by increasing elasticity, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels.
our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio as well as the impact of demand disruptions in china and ukraine. we plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. we are now projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 200 to 150 basis points lower than 2021. given the rapidly escalating cost environment, cost pressures have outpaced our pricing and future actions have been adjusted to reflect the higher cost level.
this adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impacts from pricing and cci-led cost savings. as a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. we focus on gross profit dollars. this has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression.
we now expect to grow our adjusted operating income 2% to 4% in constant currency. in addition to the gross margin impacts i just mentioned, this projection also includes our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million and brand marketing investments comparable to 2021 which reflects reductions in china and russia. considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items as well as our estimated mix of earnings by geography, we now project our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. this outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%.
we are lowering our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations to a range of $3.03 to $3.08. this compares to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and represents a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% or, in constant currency, growth of 1% to 3%. this reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and an expected $15 million benefit from the impact of optimizing our debt portfolio. in addition, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue our operating momentum and drive another year of strong performance.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on slide 29. our long-term performance has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our objectives, including through volatile environments. the long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remained strong.
several discrete items unfavorably impact our sales comparison to the second quarter of last year. excluding these impacts, our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, the effective execution of our strategies and our pricing actions. our sales growth momentum is strong. persistent high cost inflation and supply chain challenges intensified as the second quarter progressed and unfavorably impacted our profit.
importantly, we expect to mitigate this impact in the second half of the year. we're confident that with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and our ability to navigate challenging environments, we will drive another year of strong performance in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. now, let's turn to your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your question.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks very much. good morning, everybody.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi, there. i guess, first off, as you talked about, organic sales came in below where the street was looking for it, though you raised the outlook for organic for the full year. and i appreciate some of the items in 2q you highlighted were discrete. but maybe you could talk a little bit about, what gives you the confidence in raising the organic guidance for the full year? are you expecting headwinds in 2q to become tailwinds in the second half or better momentum in the underlying business? the scanner data has not necessarily showed any meaningful inflection yet that i can see at least on a year-over-year basis.
i appreciate the multiyear cagr of organic sales. so i'm trying to get a better sense for the underlying confidence in raising the full year organic to start with.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, andrew. well, first of all, our plan, as we shared on previous calls and conferences, has always been back half-loaded and stronger in the second half than in the first half. and one of the factors driving that is the cadence of our pricing actions. there is twice as much effective pricing in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year.
as you can see, right now, for the quarter, our pricing contribution to sales was about 7% and it's significantly higher going into the second half of the year. and that is a big driver of total sales build third quarter, fourth quarter. and that's, i mean, that's the driver of sales. it's also the driver on the operating profit, eps and so on as we go through.
the second thing is that we did not expect the disruption that we had in china in the second quarter. the extent of the lockdown was a surprise to us and i think to everybody and china is a big contributor to us and we expect a normalization of business in china as we go through the second half. particularly, we really expect it to be normal by the time we get to fourth quarter. and just our experience with the initial covid lockdown a couple of years ago tells us that once we get normalization, there's a significant surge in restocking by both the consumer and by our trade channels.
and so we would expect a strong contribution from china in the second half of the year. and then finally, our u.s. and emea have less difficult comparisons going in through the second half than they did in the first half of the year, not lapping inventory replenishment that we talked about last year and also not lapping some of the covid lockdowns that were still in effect, particularly in the second quarter. and finally, we expect continued strong underlying demand consumers and our customers that we're continuing to see.
mike, do you have anything you want to add to that? do you want to add something?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, i'd add that we see a lot of strength in our flavor solutions business. we saw that in the second quarter and we know that will continue in the second half. so we certainly think that's going to support, i think, really our outlook for the second half overall. but also we're seeing a lot of new business come through in the back half of the year in both segments.
and so we see a lot of strength coming through on that too. so the growth in that, it does look even stronger as we move toward the back half.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. and then just a quick follow-up. i don't think you mentioned it. i know you did last quarter when you were talking about in the core consumer business, private label had not yet really had much of a move one way or the other.
i don't think you mentioned it this time around. i'm just curious what you're seeing there. anything of note that we should be aware of? thanks so much.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think that there's anything of special note there. we are seeing some trade held by consumers, not just in our category but in other categories that we track. it's no surprise that consumers at the lower end of the income scale particularly are feeling a bit of pressure from inflation, not ours, but inflation across everything. i mean, gas prices are $5 or $6 a gallon, depending on where you live, and that puts pressure on consumers' pocket.
but i would say that it's still at a pretty low level, particularly when we look at our brands and the elasticity that we're experiencing, it's still significantly below historical levels and it's not a particular concern. i'd say also, i'll add to that, our sales with private label products are certainly an important part of our business but not particularly surging.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks so much. i just wanted to make sure i heard your commentary about pricing correctly and then i'm doing some basic math, right? you did about, i think, 6% pricing in the first half. you're saying that will double in the second half.
and you also, i think, are implying that you need around 10% organic sales growth in the second half to hit your guide. sorry to do the math on the call. i apologize for putting you on the spot. but are you effectively saying that it's reasonable for us to model maybe 12% pricing overall in the second half with volume maybe down around 2%.  is that the main takeaway here?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. ken, let me start with that. i'm going to let mike point in on that. but i think you're in the right neighborhood with those numbers.
we took -- first, when i think about the cadence of our increases and the timing of their effectiveness, you're in the right neighborhood when you think about going from 6% to 12% in the second half. i would had that -- again, our next pricing action in the americas, our largest region, is in august. and so if you're thinking about phasing that, you should have that in mind as well.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd also just add, you're going to see it across both consumer and flavor solutions pretty much at the same level.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thanks. and then a quick follow-up.
it sounds like you mentioned pricing will kind of phase in a little bit over the second half. in this context and given some of the other factors you talked about, how do we think about the cadence of the gross margin improvement in the back half? should we expect a substantial improvement in 3q? is it more 4q-weighted? maybe any color you could provide there would be helpful as we think about modeling.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ken, this is mike. that's a great question. we see -- actually, the cost peak year on year we see is third quarter and a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter. we see the pricing obviously growing second to third to fourth.
so i think what you'll see is still some gross margin challenges in the third quarter. but in the fourth quarter, the combination impact of that pricing and full benefit there and the cost. and also think about the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter overall from a volume perspective there. and as lawrence said before, things like china, which we make really the margin on, as that recovers from third into fourth too that should be a positive for 4q.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. hey, thank you, and good morning. so you gave a good deal of bottoms-up color on the incremental headwinds facing the business. so i think i'm clear on that.
but i just want to play it back from the top down. because your overall sales outlook hasn't really changed despite the more adverse currency. you're now expecting a marginally lower tax rate, a marginally lower share count, slightly less brand marketing. and while the expected cost inflation is higher at the high-teens level, it's not outside the balance of the prior outlook.
so, i guess, i just want to isolate and see if you could better define what is exactly driving the reduced operating profit and eps outlook. it feels like it's the updated outlook on china, russia, ukraine and supply conditions above and beyond the normal cost inflation. but i just want to confirm that. and if there's a way to quantify or rank order those factors, that would be great.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, steve. this is lawrence. and i think that you -- some of the little things that i think we're going to want to come back and talk about some of those marginal changes that you talked about. but on the big picture item, you've got it exactly right.
and in fact, this was part of what we were trying to message at your recent conference. the big change here are the things that were external factors that surprised us and that is what's flowing through. i'll let mike walk through the actual fringe on that. but that's...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. if you think about our guidance, we're coming down $0.14. if you think about from a china, russia, ukraine perspective, that's $0.11 right there. and then fx, as you said, we're going up 1%, that's $0.03.
so there's your $0.14. now, we're recognizing that the cost inflation which you mentioned, we had mid to high double digit, we actually moved that to high double digit. so 1% to 2% more cost during the year driven by transportation, packaging, things like that. so that did hurt us in the second quarter.
however and we're dropping a bit of that through the rest of the year, we have pricing to help mitigate that. and then below the line, some of the things you talked about, tax is a little bit of a help. some of the interest expense things are going to help offset that. but the big drivers of the external factors -- the one thing i wanted to just correct you on brand -- or just to give you insight, brand marketing is now flat.
however, that is really driven by the reduction in china, russia, ukraine and fx. so we're still spending up in our big markets to drive growth.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. yeah, that's perfect. that's perfect. just a quick follow-up on the -- to follow up on, i think, ken's question, just the cadence of gross margin recovery.
is there anything that you would call out in the second quarter as truly transitory? so is there anything -- any headwind that you experienced in the second quarter that is kind of unique and discrete to the second quarter that doesn't carry over, at least directionally. trying to get a sense if there's anything behind you.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the one thing i'd say, and you're new to our business, but the china business to us is very material. it's our second biggest market. we have three large manufacturing facilities. and the shutdown really put a lot of pressure on our cost there, a lot of extra cost for transportation, loss absorption, things like that.
so as that business recovers, obviously, that goes away. i think the other thing, too, is if you think about some of these costs that came up rapidly like transportation and packaging. i mean, fuel cost, if you go back to march, gasoline prices in the quarter versus march were up 25%. that stuff rolls through the p&l very quickly.
and pricing will catch up on that, but a one-month lag in pricing could be $30 million to $40 million of impact, which is like $0.10 a share. so we're mitigating that as quickly as we can, but sometimes we see that as kind of stabilizing now. and going forward, like i told you, the third and fourth quarter, where we see our cost outlook. but i think that is -- to your point about what is transitory, what is not, i think that gets the most of it.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and steve, i would really underscore that timing aspect. one-month difference on the effective date of our price increase, we'd be having a different conversation. if we put the $0.11, $0.12 of eps on the quarter and, of course, those price increases are in effect. i'm just saying that if that increase in one month earlier, that's what the difference would have been.
that's one reason why we're pretty confident that we're going to catch up with the cost.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. i just want to play back just real quick mike's point on china. i get it that china was uniquely detrimental to 2q, but i don't think you're saying that, that's 100% transitory. that doesn't -- as of june 1, that's not behind you, right? that it gets better, but it's not.
so...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so that's why i said that's going to really help us in the fourth quarter more. it's...
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
fair enough.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. there's different levels of openings that are happening now, that will happen throughout the quarter, yeah.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. ok, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, rob.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, lawrence. in your opening remarks, you said that your research shows that there's -- that consumers will continue to cook as much at home as they did during the pandemic, if not more. and just anecdotally, i find that this year, that's not the case. people are regaining mobility, returning to the workforce, what have you.
and you can see it in your numbers, too. so do you have any like kind of real-time insight into how consumers are behaving this year in light of the fact that your category in the u.s., it's much weaker than other packaged foods categories have been tracking.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
brendan, i will let you take that one.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, sure. good morning, rob. we're -- i guess, just to react to some of the thoughts you just shared there. we're seeing through a lot of our research, also what we're seeing in secondary research out there, is that there's still a heavy level of sustained cooking at home in the data overall, whether we're researching it or we're getting it from some of our suppliers there.
we definitely see a sustained level of eating at home. and overall, i would say that the consumer hasn't really changed that much. now, it's performing in our categories. we're seeing it play out in a number of our categories, our recipe mix, hot sauces, we still have a lot of strong sort of consumption growth there.
and so we certainly still see it play out. certainly, there are categories like meat where you see -- you do see some decline going on there. that might affect an item or two here, but we definitely still have a very balanced portfolio where we're seeing still a lot of at-home consumption going on.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and frankly, historically, you go back, rob, a long way with us, if a recession does occur, that will drive more people cooking at home. so that bodes well, i think, for our broad portfolio.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
per our research, i would say is recent in the last 30 days, is telling us that there is still a sustained level.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i mean if you look at our flavor solutions business, i mean, clearly, foodservice is strong. restaurants have reopened. people are not forced to cook at home. but there still seems to be a strong preference in that direction.
and actually, as we went through the first half, we saw in the macro data that there was a return to dining away from home and a reduction in cooking at home. but in recent weeks, that has started to turn back the other way, probably driven by economic pressures on consumers. cooking at home is more economical. i think for a variety of reasons, we're still pretty optimistic on the whole retention of cooking at home behaviors.
there are some pockets that are different. baking, really largely driven by kids being at home from school. we've seen baking-related items return to the kind of really pre-pandemic levels. that certainly is a part of our european story where our vahine brand is a big factor.
but overall, the general cooking-at-home trend persists and all of those few meal occasions that are food at-home occasions now because of people working remotely continue to support that strong consumption.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then maybe a follow-up for brendan. as you're talking to the trade about the holiday seasons and the price increases and consumer behavior, what's the reception been like? is the price increase well understood for seasons, the reasons why? and are they eager to merchandise aggressively during the holiday season?
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think the way our conversations are unfolding with customers and looking at the holiday season is one where you're still looking at, i think, improvement in supply across the season. and that is i think one of the things that underpins really a lot of optimism and strength as we go into the back half, especially as we go into this holiday season. we are certainly communicating a strength in our ability to supply and drive the holiday promotions and displays and everything else. so i would say the conversations with customers have been rather positive and strong and the outlook remains pretty healthy.
underpinned by supply, i would say, is one of the important factors there. with -- related to pricing, i mean, i think we work a lot with our customers in making sure that we're both driving category growth. and so that is a big part of our conversations as well. and again, i think those conversations, and we appreciate the partnership and working with our customers on that.
but the outlook, i think, remains very healthy.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and again, i'll just underscore that, well, we don't want to get too specific on discussions about pricing because there is customer or competitive considerations there and there is always some natural tension in those discussions. our customers know that we've taken a long-term perspective on our relationship with them, that we are transparent in the reasons for pricing and they themselves are continuing to experience inflation. that's very broad based on some of the same factors that we have and so those conversations have continued to be quite constructive.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your question.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
kasey jenkins
good morning, alexia.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi, there. can i ask about just the global supply chain dynamics. you obviously are sourcing ingredients from many different places around the world, probably more so than other large packaged food companies. i'd just be curious to hear sort of what you're seeing in terms of global supply chain, domestic supply chain.
where are the real pain points for you now and is there any light at the end of the tunnel?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, alexia. this is actually a, i'd say, our worst disruption on supply chain really was third quarter of last year and has continued to get better incrementally every month. we're not out of the woods by a long shot in terms of normalization. but the really broad scale disruptions that we were experiencing a year ago are behind us and the disruptions are pretty much more discrete factors.
i'd say our global sourcing of raw materials from points all around the world for our various markets around the world has been one of our strengths through the whole pandemic experience and the post-pandemic time and continues to be a strength. our challenges have been more on either predominantly local packaging issues and specific packaged materials from very specific suppliers. some of them are -- continue to be a sore point. and then there's -- in areas where we have -- there's still some areas where even though we've added a lot of capacity, the demand is still extraordinary and we're pressed to meet the needs of our customers.
and those -- and again, those would be in a few very specific areas.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
very helpful. and then just as a quick follow-up. there was a comment in the press release about unfavorable mix in flavor solutions. how important was that? because obviously, the profit decline was very marked this quarter.
and what drove that? and then i'll pass it on.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean -- it's mike. i mean unfavorable mix was one of the factors. if you think on a quarter-to-quarter perspective look back here, really strong performance in some of the higher-margin categories kind of -- and this year, the strongest performance was in the away-from-home versus to at-home.
so a little bit between those two categories, just we mixed down a little bit. nothing to be concerned about. as we've talked about, flavor solutions can be lumpy based on the products we sell and things like that. but that's part of the reason.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. i was hoping to just maybe try to understand the second half, kind of framing it maybe from a different light. because it would seem like the full year guidance implies second half operating margins up about 250 basis points year over year. i get that there's an incremental pricing actions that benefit and the price cost balance reflect -- will probably flip positively presumably in the fourth quarter.
but also that's a dilutive impact to percent margins. just trying to get a sense of what -- how do we -- notwithstanding some of the discrete things in the may quarter, specifically to the china impact in particular, but we've got volumes that demand elasticity that would suggest volumes aren't going to get better. between businesses, flavor solutions is probably growing faster than consumer. so that's a mix headwind at the corporate level.
and i'm just trying to understand kind of how do we get to that magnitude of percent margin improvement in the back half.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
adam, i'm going to start and i'm going to let mike pick it up. again, i want to let us underscore that there is a big change in the relationship between pricing and cost as we go through the -- as we go through the year. in the second half, we -- price increases begin to overtake the cost increases and rather than trailing or beginning the year, we're recovering the cost increases. that's going to be a big factor between the continued strong demand and having twice as much effect of pricing in the second half as the first half is going to be a really big factor.
mike, do you want to?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there's other factors, too, adam. i mean we really we talk about pricing as a way to offset cost, and we have other levers when we talk about revenue management, our cci-led cost savings. so we continue to lean hard on driving additional cost savings in this inflationary environment. we see continued strong demand driving that.
high-margin products helping us there. so there's a lot of reasons to believe. to your point though, i mean, between third and fourth quarter, i mean, the fourth quarter is where a lot of this comes to fruition from getting to a positive margin change year on year.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and i'll add. so we don't expect covid lockdowns to repeat in china. that's a wildcard. we've been surprised there before other agreements that could happen again.
we don't think -- we're not expecting that. but that was a big unfavorable in the first half, particularly in the second quarter that we expect to correct and normalize as we go through the second half.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so maybe just to help clarify that. as we think about the year-to-date second quarter or year-to-date kind of performance. what's been the realized cci savings year-to-date relative to the 85% that you talked about for the full year? first, i don't think i heard a specific number in terms of what the realized cost inflation has been year-to-date just relative to that high teens number that you've targeted or you've expected for the full year.
and i guess just any way to help dimensionalize some of the -- you give the brand marketing piece, but other sg&a, just where that magnitude of kind of tightening the box strings there and how much that can contribute in the second half?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this is weighted to the second half, adam. that's all i'm going to say.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, i appreciate that. i appreciate that color. i'll pass it on.

peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thank you for taking the questions. 
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
lawrence kurzius, i just wanted to circle back actually to andrew's question around private label. and going back to the slides, you do have a section here talking about more entry price points. and i'm just curious, is that a response to what you see as impending, more share shifting to private label. and so you feel like you need more entry price points? or is it something else? you talked about inflating cost baskets and maybe in other categories like proteins.
and i noticed here you're talking about entry price points on things like grill mates and lawyr's, which tend to be more tied to protein. so just curious to kind of get the thoughts around that that...
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, this is -- that really doesn't have anything to do with private label. but has to do with -- there's a concern that consumers may be under pressure as we were seeing some early signs that consumers may be feeling some economic pressure. it's no secret that things like gas prices are up. our customers are talking -- retailer customers are talking about consumers feeling some pressure.
and we have some concern that between the inflationary environment and the high risk of inflation -- sorry, that's the wrong word there -- the high risk of recession as we go into the second half and even into 2023, that we want to be able to make sure that consumers, especially in the lower half of the income scale, are still being served and have access to our categories. our goal is to have products that appeal to consumers at every price point across the whole category. and between our new product launches, our brand marketing and our brand marketing activity, we are taking a tone that tries to address that pressure to consumer. we've got -- i know we're kind of hitting time and general mills is probably talking right now, but brendan's got a lot of color that he can add on this question and i'd like to give him a chance to.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
well, i think, lawrence, i think you hit it largely right. we're trying to make sure that our portfolio and our assortment is really geared toward what consumers are starting to face. and it could very well be price points that are lower in terms of smaller sizes. i would say though, also, there's another dynamic on the other end which is happening, which is we actually see even more consumers switching to larger sizes, looking for more value.
and so it's playing out really on both ends. and so those are things that we're reacting to and making sure that we drive even more distribution and items in our assortment that serve those needs and those price points that consumers are looking for.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and maybe just a quick one. lawrence, you did mention i think that packaging tightness was impacting a certain couple of categories in u.s.
spices and seasonings. just any more color there? what specifically brands or categories we should be looking at? just if that starts to improve, would we see another...
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't want to get too specific, but i also don't really want to call out our suppliers with whom we're trying to have a constructive -- competitors either for that matter. but we had some trouble with glass for our organic spices in our gourmet range that i think we have resolved now. and we've had some ongoing challenges on some other -- more of the rigid container kind of packaging and mostly in the u.s., frankly.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks so much guys.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer

lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. i'd like to start by welcoming brendan to this morning's call. in addition to his continuing role as president of our global consumer business, brendan now has responsibility for our business worldwide in his newly appointed role as president and coo.
at the end of our prepared remarks, i may ask him to weigh in on some of your questions. mccormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other volatility has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our financial objectives. broadly, our results in the second quarter were in line with our sales and profit expectations despite certain global challenges, including a greater-than-expected level of high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruption in china from covid-related lockdowns and the conflict in ukraine. as our second quarter progressed, the dynamics of these conditions intensified and negatively impacted our sales and profit results.
before discussing our second quarter results in more detail, i'd like to comment on each of these, starting on page 5. consistent with the rest of the industry, high cost inflation and supply chain are continuing challenges. to partially offset cost pressures, we've taken multiple pricing actions and, as planned, we are raising prices again. inflation continued to escalate, and we've adjusted our upcoming pricing actions accordingly.
we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our cci-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and reducing discretionary spend where possible. we expect our pricing actions and other levers to begin to outpace cost pressures late in the third quarter, with higher cost and higher offsetting pricing actions than we expected on our last call, which further weights our 2022 profit to the second half of the year. we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time.
in china, during the second quarter, there was significant unanticipated disruption in consumption due to severe covid-related lockdowns in shanghai and other cities throughout china. china is our second biggest sales country, with operations in shanghai, guangzhou and wuhan. our shanghai operation produces approximately 40% of our total china sales, which are distributed throughout the country and supports both of our segments. and as a reminder, our branded food service demand is included in our consumer segment in china.
the lockdowns lasted roughly 75 days, with our shanghai plant forced to close for two weeks at the onset, with employees living in the facility. once we were able to reopen, we were impacted by lockdown-related labor shortages due to workers being quarantined. during april and may, we incurred significant incremental manufacturing and transportation costs to supply our customers. in addition, as restaurants largely closed and consumers unable to shop for extended periods in our strongest geographies, we experienced significant demand softness as well.
market conditions in china have also allowed very little opportunity to increase prices. while we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in china, but we will not be able to recover the sales and profit impact we experienced in this fiscal year. finally, regarding the conflict in ukraine, in mid-march, we suspended operations in russia, and our operations in ukraine were paused. these countries account for less than 1% of our overall business.
we have recently decided to exit our consumer business in russia. now, for more detail on our second quarter results, starting with sales on slide 7. sales declined 1% from the second quarter of last year, including an unfavorable impact from currency. our constant-currency sales were comparable to last year, with growth from pricing actions offset by a decline in volume and product mix.
the volume decline was impacted unfavorably by several discrete items, including a 1% impact from the china consumption disruption and the conflict in ukraine i just mentioned, a 1% impact from the exit of low-margin business in india and a 2% impact from lapping the u.s. trade inventory replenishment during last year's second quarter. excluding these items, our sales performance would have been 4% growth, reflecting the strength of our broad global portfolio and effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions. while growth in both segments was impacted by the discrete items, they were more impactful to our consumer segment.
notably, our growth in flavor solutions was outstanding. comparisons to 2021 and 2020 remain difficult due to the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the second quarter of the last two years. using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, second quarter sales have grown at a constant currency compounded annual growth rate or cagr of 6%. moving to profit.
adjusted operating income was down 33% or 32% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share was down 30%. the adjusted operating income comparison includes 7% unfavorable impact from the disruption to china's consumption and the conflict in ukraine. although we anticipated the profit driven by sales growth in the second quarter would be more than offset by higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, the impact was greater than expected due to continuing cost escalation. while this pressured second quarter profit, we expect to mitigate this impact later this year.
now, moving to second quarter business updates for each of our segments. starting with our consumer segment on slide 9, our second quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions. in the americas, our first wave of pricing was phased in during our fourth quarter of last year, the second wave during the second quarter in april and the third wave will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. with the first wave, we saw a very low level of elasticity.
with the second wave, we are seeing more price elasticity, although still below historical levels. while consumer spending has remained strong, consumers are now under significant pressure for broad-based inflation, notably fuel prices and other macro factors. as we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels. overall, our pricing actions in emea and apz are on track and our elasticity impacts are similar to the americas.
in emea and apz, pricing timing varies by market within each region. in some markets, particularly in emea, there are regulatory guidelines on when we take pricing, which generally creates a lag in the timing of pricing compared to the americas. in this unprecedented environment, however, we are taking additional actions in markets across emea. now for some further highlights by region, starting with the americas.
our total u.s. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%. and over the last three years, since 2019, and consumption has grown at a three-year cagr of 7%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. in the americas, a sales decline in the second quarter included the impact of lapping a 4% overshipment of consumption to replenish retailer inventories in the second quarter of last year.
our second quarter shipments this year were in line with our consumption change. demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. however, some products remain stressed by sustained high demand. shelf conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance of another quarter of share gain.
our spices and seasoning share was pressured during the quarter by the shortage of certain packaging materials as well as certain organic spices. some of these have been resolved and some will remain ongoing. we continue to use our category and revenue management capability to strengthen our spices and seasoning portfolio and optimize the category performance for both mccormick and our retailers. the strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we will begin to realize later this year.
in emea, we continue to have strong share performance in most categories and markets. during the second quarter, we lapped strong year-ago consumption, partially due to last year's covid-related restrictions throughout emea, where restrictions extended longer than other regions. our botany brand of homemade dessert products in france, a product line unique to our emea region, was most impacted as recently we've seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level. in other categories in the region, we believe there has been a step-up in consumption.
and in the asia pacific region, in addition to the consumption disruption in china, second quarter growth was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in india. at the end of last year, we decided to exit our rice business, the kohinoor brand, to enable the region to focus on our higher-margin core category. turning to flavor solutions on slide 10. our sales performance for the quarter was outstanding, with both pricing and volume growth contributing.
we drove double-digit growth in both the at-home and away-from-home parts of our portfolio. looking at our flavor solutions growth over the past three years, since the covid-19 restrictions caused dramatic second quarter comparisons in '20 and '21, our sales cagr is 8%, largely driven by volumes. our pricing actions increased sales in all three regions. broadly, pricing actions in the branded foodservice part of our portfolio followed the same cadence as those in each region in consumer business.
in the rest of our flavor solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows, with automatic price adjusters in many contracts and the timing is going to vary based on those windows. in this dynamic environment though, with costs escalating so quickly, we are having discussions outside of those windows and passing costs through faster than usual. higher volumes also contributed to growth in the americas and emea region. demand has remained strong for certain parts of our business in these regions.
our supply chain is being pressured to meet this demand and we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. we appreciate our customers working with us through this pressure. in the americas, where our customer base is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, our at-home customers, strong growth was driven by flavors for savory snacks as well as performance nutrition and health applications with these customers. in emea, our customer base is more skewed to quick service restaurants, or qsrs, and our strong qsr momentum contributed to growth in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution.
branded foodservice growth was strong in both the americas and emea regions, driven by restaurant and institutional food service customers. demand continues to strengthen in this channel, particularly as travel accelerates and restaurants benefit from consumers shifting to takeaway and delivery. overall, our flavor solutions sales demand and growth momentum continues to be strong. now, let me expand on our growth platform and positioning in the current environment.
turning to slide 11. global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. we are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, but the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate.
mccormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. with the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers products. we are end-to-end flavor. we continue to make investments to sustainably meet the growing demand and to fuel further growth.
in our global supply chain, we increased our capacity with our recently opened u.k. peterborough flavor solutions manufacturing facility and have begun our expansion of boneless footprint to support future flavor growth. we are also increasing our capacity in the fast-growing hot sauce category and investing in seasoning capacity to support increased demand and strengthen resiliency. as we've said, with the sustained level of high consumer demand, we're benefiting from the manufacturing capacity we've added.
while we still experienced disruptions in the supply chain, they are much more specific mainly from a transportation and packaging supply standpoint. we experienced the peak disruption in the third quarter of last year. and with every month, the supply chain continues to get better. we feel good about the progress we're making.
we are strategically investing behind our brands to drive growth, including in brand marketing, as we did throughout the pandemic with our three-year brand marketing cagr approximating our consumer segment sales cagr for the same period. we're pivoting our messaging to emphasize to consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars. for instance, we're launching a digital messaging highlighting the value of our product by making a great flavorful meal economically. we add flavor for only pennies per serving and recipes like our 30-minute taco casserole are family and budget-friendly answers to what's for dinner.
we continue to invest in new products. in our consumer segment, we are responding to new consumer behaviors, like increased at-home lunches. for instance, our new patent pending french's creamy mustard is off to a great start. we're sensitive to the needs of price-conscious consumers, not just in these challenging economic times, but every day.
our portfolio includes branded items to accommodate consumers' needs and provide solutions for everyone at every price point as well as private label products. our new product launches include additional entry-level price point product for affordability and larger sizes of key high usage items for better value. while we are still seeing strong consumer spending, we know that inflation is a significant concern for consumers, more so than covid. we're leveraging our proprietary research, which served us well during the pandemic, to monitor for any signals of changing behavior.
our research continues to indicate consumers are going to cook as much at home or more than they did during the pandemic for many reasons. one of them is that they find it more economical. to the extent there is a recession, it further reinforces cooking at home, and we know from our past sales performance that our categories and brands perform well during a recessionary period. now, for some summary comments on slide 13 before turning it over to mike.
we remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. we have grown and compounded that growth over the years regardless of the environment. the long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly gives us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate a challenging global environment.
despite the pressures we experienced in the second quarter, we are well positioned and confident in delivering strong performance in 2022 and beyond, while driving sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. mccormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. their agility and their teamwork drive our momentum and success, and i want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. and now, i'll turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone. starting on slide 15. our top-line constant-currency sales were comparable to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 7% growth from pricing actions, offset by a 7% decline in volume and product mix. excluding the 4% impact of the discrete item lawrence mentioned earlier, our sales performance would have reflected 4% growth.
consumer segment sales declined 7% in constant currency. the impact from lapping the u.s. trade inventory replenishment, the consumption disruption in china, the exit of low-margin business in india and the conflict in the ukraine contributed 6% to that decline. the remaining 1% decline was due to lower volume, partially offset by pricing actions.
on a three-year basis, our second quarter constant-currency sales cagr was 4%. on slide 16, consumer sales in the americas declined 4% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and mix, partially offset by pricing actions. this decline is attributable to lapping trade inventory replenishments in the second quarter of last year. over the past three years, constant-currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 7%.
in emea, constant-currency consumer sales declined 11%, primarily due to lapping high year-ago demand driven by covid-related lockdowns, the most significant impact of which was lower sales of vahine homemade dessert products. a 1% unfavorable impact from lower sales in russia and ukraine also contributed to the decline. pricing actions in all markets partially offset the lower volume. over the past three years, emea's constant-currency sales grew at a 3% cagr.
constant-currency consumer sales in the asia-pacific region declined 18%, including a 20% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in china as well as the exit of low-margin business in india. pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. on a three-year basis, apz's second quarter constant-currency sales cagr was a 7% decline, driven by the china and india impact i just mentioned. excluding this impact, sales grew at a 5% cagr over the past three years.
turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 19. we grew second quarter constant-currency sales 11% due to pricing actions as well as higher volume and mix. this growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in sales related to the combined impact of the china disruption and the conflict in ukraine. second quarter constant-currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% cagr.
in the americas, flavor solutions' constant-currency sales grew 12%, driven by both pricing and the combination of volume and mix. higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth, with higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing to growth. over the past three years, constant-currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 8%. in emea, we drove 19% constant-currency sales growth with a 14% increase in volume and mix and 5% related to pricing actions.
emea's flavor solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to the conflict in ukraine, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with qsr and branded foodservice customers. over the past three years, emea's constant-currency sales grew at a 10% cagr. in the asia-pacific region, flavor solutions sales declined 6% in constant currency. the decline was driven by a 7% impact from lower volume in china due to the covid-related restrictions, partially offset by pricing actions in all markets across the region.
apz grew constant-currency sales at a 3% cagr over the past three years. as seen on slide 23, adjusted gross profit margin declined 550 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period. realizing this is a sizable compression, i will spend a moment on the significant drivers. let me start with the drivers we anticipated.
first, nearly half of this decline, approximately 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. we focus on gross profit dollars. this impact was more significant than in the first quarter because of the higher level of pricing in the second quarter. product mix was unfavorable as compared to the second quarter of last year.
in our consumer segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are lapping strong u.s. spices and seasonings growth related to the inventory replenishment. in our flavor solutions segment, sales growth in our away-from-home products was higher than our at-home products and we are lapping strong sales of beverage flavors last year. a sales shift between our consumer and flavor solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix.
in our flavor solutions segment, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by start-up and dual running costs as we transitioned production to our new u.k. peterborough manufacturing facility. of note, cci-led cost savings partially offset the impacts i just walked through and we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year. in addition to the net impact of the anticipated items i just detailed, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by the following items: as lawrence discussed, cost inflation and supply chain pressures escalated during the second quarter impacting our results more than expected, primarily related to transportation costs and faster-turning materials.
while we have adjusted our upcoming pricing actions to reflect that escalation and we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time, our second quarter gross margin compression reflects the usual lag associated with pricing. we expect pricing to begin outpacing the cost pressures later this year and continue into next year. our cost recovery will vary by region and segment. currently, our pricing lag is more significant in our flavor solutions segment.
lawrence previously mentioned we have incremental costs to meet strong demand for certain parts of our flavor solutions business, thus impacting our gross margin. and finally, as already mentioned, significant cost due to the covid-related restrictions in china had an unfavorable impact to profit. moving to slide 24. selling, general and administrative expenses were lower than the second quarter of last year and as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points.
the decline was driven by lower employee benefit and brand marketing expenses as well as discretionary spending reductions, partially offset by higher distribution costs. the decline in brand marketing investments was driven by china and russia reductions. importantly, across our other markets, we invested in brand marketing at a comparable level to last year. the net impact of the factors i just mentioned resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021.
in the consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 29%. and in the flavor solutions segment, it declined 40%. a 1% unfavorable impact from currency is included in each of these declines. turning to income taxes on slide 25.
our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6% compared to 22.2% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. at the bottom line, please turn on slide 26, second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. the decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. on slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet.
our cash flow from operations was $154 million through the second quarter of 2022 compared to $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. this decrease was primarily driven by lower net income. cash flow from operations will be weighted to the second half of the year, similar to our profit growth. we returned $198 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $102 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter.
we expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. now, turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 28. as a reminder, last quarter, the conditions in russia, ukraine and china were just unfolding and cost inflation and supply chain challenges remain dynamic and fast moving.
today, we have a better view of the macro environment and our guidance for the full year considers the greater impact from these items. in addition, and as noted previously, we have always expected our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. we now expect it to be even more so. we are projecting strong top-line growth with profit impacted by the global challenges i just mentioned.
we also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, an increase from our previous estimate of 1 percentage point unfavorable. on the top line, we now expect to grow constant-currency sales 5% to 7%. we expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing, which will accelerate significantly in the second half versus the first half. while we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by increasing elasticity, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels.
our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio as well as the impact of demand disruptions in china and ukraine. we plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans. we are now projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 200 to 150 basis points lower than 2021. given the rapidly escalating cost environment, cost pressures have outpaced our pricing and future actions have been adjusted to reflect the higher cost level.
this adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impacts from pricing and cci-led cost savings. as a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. we focus on gross profit dollars. this has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression.
we now expect to grow our adjusted operating income 2% to 4% in constant currency. in addition to the gross margin impacts i just mentioned, this projection also includes our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million and brand marketing investments comparable to 2021 which reflects reductions in china and russia. considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items as well as our estimated mix of earnings by geography, we now project our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. this outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%.
we are lowering our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations to a range of $3.03 to $3.08. this compares to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and represents a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% or, in constant currency, growth of 1% to 3%. this reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and an expected $15 million benefit from the impact of optimizing our debt portfolio. in addition, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue our operating momentum and drive another year of strong performance.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on slide 29. our long-term performance has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our objectives, including through volatile environments. the long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remained strong.
several discrete items unfavorably impact our sales comparison to the second quarter of last year. excluding these impacts, our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, the effective execution of our strategies and our pricing actions. our sales growth momentum is strong. persistent high cost inflation and supply chain challenges intensified as the second quarter progressed and unfavorably impacted our profit.
importantly, we expect to mitigate this impact in the second half of the year. we're confident that with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and our ability to navigate challenging environments, we will drive another year of strong performance in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. now, let's turn to your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your question.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks very much. good morning, everybody.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi, there. i guess, first off, as you talked about, organic sales came in below where the street was looking for it, though you raised the outlook for organic for the full year. and i appreciate some of the items in 2q you highlighted were discrete. but maybe you could talk a little bit about, what gives you the confidence in raising the organic guidance for the full year? are you expecting headwinds in 2q to become tailwinds in the second half or better momentum in the underlying business? the scanner data has not necessarily showed any meaningful inflection yet that i can see at least on a year-over-year basis.
i appreciate the multiyear cagr of organic sales. so i'm trying to get a better sense for the underlying confidence in raising the full year organic to start with.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, andrew. well, first of all, our plan, as we shared on previous calls and conferences, has always been back half-loaded and stronger in the second half than in the first half. and one of the factors driving that is the cadence of our pricing actions. there is twice as much effective pricing in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year.
as you can see, right now, for the quarter, our pricing contribution to sales was about 7% and it's significantly higher going into the second half of the year. and that is a big driver of total sales build third quarter, fourth quarter. and that's, i mean, that's the driver of sales. it's also the driver on the operating profit, eps and so on as we go through.
the second thing is that we did not expect the disruption that we had in china in the second quarter. the extent of the lockdown was a surprise to us and i think to everybody and china is a big contributor to us and we expect a normalization of business in china as we go through the second half. particularly, we really expect it to be normal by the time we get to fourth quarter. and just our experience with the initial covid lockdown a couple of years ago tells us that once we get normalization, there's a significant surge in restocking by both the consumer and by our trade channels.
and so we would expect a strong contribution from china in the second half of the year. and then finally, our u.s. and emea have less difficult comparisons going in through the second half than they did in the first half of the year, not lapping inventory replenishment that we talked about last year and also not lapping some of the covid lockdowns that were still in effect, particularly in the second quarter. and finally, we expect continued strong underlying demand consumers and our customers that we're continuing to see.
mike, do you have anything you want to add to that? do you want to add something?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, i'd add that we see a lot of strength in our flavor solutions business. we saw that in the second quarter and we know that will continue in the second half. so we certainly think that's going to support, i think, really our outlook for the second half overall. but also we're seeing a lot of new business come through in the back half of the year in both segments.
and so we see a lot of strength coming through on that too. so the growth in that, it does look even stronger as we move toward the back half.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. and then just a quick follow-up. i don't think you mentioned it. i know you did last quarter when you were talking about in the core consumer business, private label had not yet really had much of a move one way or the other.
i don't think you mentioned it this time around. i'm just curious what you're seeing there. anything of note that we should be aware of? thanks so much.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think that there's anything of special note there. we are seeing some trade held by consumers, not just in our category but in other categories that we track. it's no surprise that consumers at the lower end of the income scale particularly are feeling a bit of pressure from inflation, not ours, but inflation across everything. i mean, gas prices are $5 or $6 a gallon, depending on where you live, and that puts pressure on consumers' pocket.
but i would say that it's still at a pretty low level, particularly when we look at our brands and the elasticity that we're experiencing, it's still significantly below historical levels and it's not a particular concern. i'd say also, i'll add to that, our sales with private label products are certainly an important part of our business but not particularly surging.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks so much. i just wanted to make sure i heard your commentary about pricing correctly and then i'm doing some basic math, right? you did about, i think, 6% pricing in the first half. you're saying that will double in the second half.
and you also, i think, are implying that you need around 10% organic sales growth in the second half to hit your guide. sorry to do the math on the call. i apologize for putting you on the spot. but are you effectively saying that it's reasonable for us to model maybe 12% pricing overall in the second half with volume maybe down around 2%.  is that the main takeaway here?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. ken, let me start with that. i'm going to let mike point in on that. but i think you're in the right neighborhood with those numbers.
we took -- first, when i think about the cadence of our increases and the timing of their effectiveness, you're in the right neighborhood when you think about going from 6% to 12% in the second half. i would had that -- again, our next pricing action in the americas, our largest region, is in august. and so if you're thinking about phasing that, you should have that in mind as well.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd also just add, you're going to see it across both consumer and flavor solutions pretty much at the same level.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thanks. and then a quick follow-up.
it sounds like you mentioned pricing will kind of phase in a little bit over the second half. in this context and given some of the other factors you talked about, how do we think about the cadence of the gross margin improvement in the back half? should we expect a substantial improvement in 3q? is it more 4q-weighted? maybe any color you could provide there would be helpful as we think about modeling.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ken, this is mike. that's a great question. we see -- actually, the cost peak year on year we see is third quarter and a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter. we see the pricing obviously growing second to third to fourth.
so i think what you'll see is still some gross margin challenges in the third quarter. but in the fourth quarter, the combination impact of that pricing and full benefit there and the cost. and also think about the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter overall from a volume perspective there. and as lawrence said before, things like china, which we make really the margin on, as that recovers from third into fourth too that should be a positive for 4q.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. hey, thank you, and good morning. so you gave a good deal of bottoms-up color on the incremental headwinds facing the business. so i think i'm clear on that.
but i just want to play it back from the top down. because your overall sales outlook hasn't really changed despite the more adverse currency. you're now expecting a marginally lower tax rate, a marginally lower share count, slightly less brand marketing. and while the expected cost inflation is higher at the high-teens level, it's not outside the balance of the prior outlook.
so, i guess, i just want to isolate and see if you could better define what is exactly driving the reduced operating profit and eps outlook. it feels like it's the updated outlook on china, russia, ukraine and supply conditions above and beyond the normal cost inflation. but i just want to confirm that. and if there's a way to quantify or rank order those factors, that would be great.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, steve. this is lawrence. and i think that you -- some of the little things that i think we're going to want to come back and talk about some of those marginal changes that you talked about. but on the big picture item, you've got it exactly right.
and in fact, this was part of what we were trying to message at your recent conference. the big change here are the things that were external factors that surprised us and that is what's flowing through. i'll let mike walk through the actual fringe on that. but that's...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. if you think about our guidance, we're coming down $0.14. if you think about from a china, russia, ukraine perspective, that's $0.11 right there. and then fx, as you said, we're going up 1%, that's $0.03.
so there's your $0.14. now, we're recognizing that the cost inflation which you mentioned, we had mid to high double digit, we actually moved that to high double digit. so 1% to 2% more cost during the year driven by transportation, packaging, things like that. so that did hurt us in the second quarter.
however and we're dropping a bit of that through the rest of the year, we have pricing to help mitigate that. and then below the line, some of the things you talked about, tax is a little bit of a help. some of the interest expense things are going to help offset that. but the big drivers of the external factors -- the one thing i wanted to just correct you on brand -- or just to give you insight, brand marketing is now flat.
however, that is really driven by the reduction in china, russia, ukraine and fx. so we're still spending up in our big markets to drive growth.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. yeah, that's perfect. that's perfect. just a quick follow-up on the -- to follow up on, i think, ken's question, just the cadence of gross margin recovery.
is there anything that you would call out in the second quarter as truly transitory? so is there anything -- any headwind that you experienced in the second quarter that is kind of unique and discrete to the second quarter that doesn't carry over, at least directionally. trying to get a sense if there's anything behind you.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the one thing i'd say, and you're new to our business, but the china business to us is very material. it's our second biggest market. we have three large manufacturing facilities. and the shutdown really put a lot of pressure on our cost there, a lot of extra cost for transportation, loss absorption, things like that.
so as that business recovers, obviously, that goes away. i think the other thing, too, is if you think about some of these costs that came up rapidly like transportation and packaging. i mean, fuel cost, if you go back to march, gasoline prices in the quarter versus march were up 25%. that stuff rolls through the p&l very quickly.
and pricing will catch up on that, but a one-month lag in pricing could be $30 million to $40 million of impact, which is like $0.10 a share. so we're mitigating that as quickly as we can, but sometimes we see that as kind of stabilizing now. and going forward, like i told you, the third and fourth quarter, where we see our cost outlook. but i think that is -- to your point about what is transitory, what is not, i think that gets the most of it.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and steve, i would really underscore that timing aspect. one-month difference on the effective date of our price increase, we'd be having a different conversation. if we put the $0.11, $0.12 of eps on the quarter and, of course, those price increases are in effect. i'm just saying that if that increase in one month earlier, that's what the difference would have been.
that's one reason why we're pretty confident that we're going to catch up with the cost.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. i just want to play back just real quick mike's point on china. i get it that china was uniquely detrimental to 2q, but i don't think you're saying that, that's 100% transitory. that doesn't -- as of june 1, that's not behind you, right? that it gets better, but it's not.
so...
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so that's why i said that's going to really help us in the fourth quarter more. it's...
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
fair enough.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. there's different levels of openings that are happening now, that will happen throughout the quarter, yeah.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. ok, thank you very much.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, rob.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, lawrence. in your opening remarks, you said that your research shows that there's -- that consumers will continue to cook as much at home as they did during the pandemic, if not more. and just anecdotally, i find that this year, that's not the case. people are regaining mobility, returning to the workforce, what have you.
and you can see it in your numbers, too. so do you have any like kind of real-time insight into how consumers are behaving this year in light of the fact that your category in the u.s., it's much weaker than other packaged foods categories have been tracking.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
brendan, i will let you take that one.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, sure. good morning, rob. we're -- i guess, just to react to some of the thoughts you just shared there. we're seeing through a lot of our research, also what we're seeing in secondary research out there, is that there's still a heavy level of sustained cooking at home in the data overall, whether we're researching it or we're getting it from some of our suppliers there.
we definitely see a sustained level of eating at home. and overall, i would say that the consumer hasn't really changed that much. now, it's performing in our categories. we're seeing it play out in a number of our categories, our recipe mix, hot sauces, we still have a lot of strong sort of consumption growth there.
and so we certainly still see it play out. certainly, there are categories like meat where you see -- you do see some decline going on there. that might affect an item or two here, but we definitely still have a very balanced portfolio where we're seeing still a lot of at-home consumption going on.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and frankly, historically, you go back, rob, a long way with us, if a recession does occur, that will drive more people cooking at home. so that bodes well, i think, for our broad portfolio.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
per our research, i would say is recent in the last 30 days, is telling us that there is still a sustained level.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i mean if you look at our flavor solutions business, i mean, clearly, foodservice is strong. restaurants have reopened. people are not forced to cook at home. but there still seems to be a strong preference in that direction.
and actually, as we went through the first half, we saw in the macro data that there was a return to dining away from home and a reduction in cooking at home. but in recent weeks, that has started to turn back the other way, probably driven by economic pressures on consumers. cooking at home is more economical. i think for a variety of reasons, we're still pretty optimistic on the whole retention of cooking at home behaviors.
there are some pockets that are different. baking, really largely driven by kids being at home from school. we've seen baking-related items return to the kind of really pre-pandemic levels. that certainly is a part of our european story where our vahine brand is a big factor.
but overall, the general cooking-at-home trend persists and all of those few meal occasions that are food at-home occasions now because of people working remotely continue to support that strong consumption.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then maybe a follow-up for brendan. as you're talking to the trade about the holiday seasons and the price increases and consumer behavior, what's the reception been like? is the price increase well understood for seasons, the reasons why? and are they eager to merchandise aggressively during the holiday season?
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think the way our conversations are unfolding with customers and looking at the holiday season is one where you're still looking at, i think, improvement in supply across the season. and that is i think one of the things that underpins really a lot of optimism and strength as we go into the back half, especially as we go into this holiday season. we are certainly communicating a strength in our ability to supply and drive the holiday promotions and displays and everything else. so i would say the conversations with customers have been rather positive and strong and the outlook remains pretty healthy.
underpinned by supply, i would say, is one of the important factors there. with -- related to pricing, i mean, i think we work a lot with our customers in making sure that we're both driving category growth. and so that is a big part of our conversations as well. and again, i think those conversations, and we appreciate the partnership and working with our customers on that.
but the outlook, i think, remains very healthy.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and again, i'll just underscore that, well, we don't want to get too specific on discussions about pricing because there is customer or competitive considerations there and there is always some natural tension in those discussions. our customers know that we've taken a long-term perspective on our relationship with them, that we are transparent in the reasons for pricing and they themselves are continuing to experience inflation. that's very broad based on some of the same factors that we have and so those conversations have continued to be quite constructive.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your question.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
kasey jenkins
good morning, alexia.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi, there. can i ask about just the global supply chain dynamics. you obviously are sourcing ingredients from many different places around the world, probably more so than other large packaged food companies. i'd just be curious to hear sort of what you're seeing in terms of global supply chain, domestic supply chain.
where are the real pain points for you now and is there any light at the end of the tunnel?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, alexia. this is actually a, i'd say, our worst disruption on supply chain really was third quarter of last year and has continued to get better incrementally every month. we're not out of the woods by a long shot in terms of normalization. but the really broad scale disruptions that we were experiencing a year ago are behind us and the disruptions are pretty much more discrete factors.
i'd say our global sourcing of raw materials from points all around the world for our various markets around the world has been one of our strengths through the whole pandemic experience and the post-pandemic time and continues to be a strength. our challenges have been more on either predominantly local packaging issues and specific packaged materials from very specific suppliers. some of them are -- continue to be a sore point. and then there's -- in areas where we have -- there's still some areas where even though we've added a lot of capacity, the demand is still extraordinary and we're pressed to meet the needs of our customers.
and those -- and again, those would be in a few very specific areas.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
very helpful. and then just as a quick follow-up. there was a comment in the press release about unfavorable mix in flavor solutions. how important was that? because obviously, the profit decline was very marked this quarter.
and what drove that? and then i'll pass it on.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean -- it's mike. i mean unfavorable mix was one of the factors. if you think on a quarter-to-quarter perspective look back here, really strong performance in some of the higher-margin categories kind of -- and this year, the strongest performance was in the away-from-home versus to at-home.
so a little bit between those two categories, just we mixed down a little bit. nothing to be concerned about. as we've talked about, flavor solutions can be lumpy based on the products we sell and things like that. but that's part of the reason.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. yes, thank you. good morning, everyone.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. i was hoping to just maybe try to understand the second half, kind of framing it maybe from a different light. because it would seem like the full year guidance implies second half operating margins up about 250 basis points year over year. i get that there's an incremental pricing actions that benefit and the price cost balance reflect -- will probably flip positively presumably in the fourth quarter.
but also that's a dilutive impact to percent margins. just trying to get a sense of what -- how do we -- notwithstanding some of the discrete things in the may quarter, specifically to the china impact in particular, but we've got volumes that demand elasticity that would suggest volumes aren't going to get better. between businesses, flavor solutions is probably growing faster than consumer. so that's a mix headwind at the corporate level.
and i'm just trying to understand kind of how do we get to that magnitude of percent margin improvement in the back half.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
adam, i'm going to start and i'm going to let mike pick it up. again, i want to let us underscore that there is a big change in the relationship between pricing and cost as we go through the -- as we go through the year. in the second half, we -- price increases begin to overtake the cost increases and rather than trailing or beginning the year, we're recovering the cost increases. that's going to be a big factor between the continued strong demand and having twice as much effect of pricing in the second half as the first half is going to be a really big factor.
mike, do you want to?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there's other factors, too, adam. i mean we really we talk about pricing as a way to offset cost, and we have other levers when we talk about revenue management, our cci-led cost savings. so we continue to lean hard on driving additional cost savings in this inflationary environment. we see continued strong demand driving that.
high-margin products helping us there. so there's a lot of reasons to believe. to your point though, i mean, between third and fourth quarter, i mean, the fourth quarter is where a lot of this comes to fruition from getting to a positive margin change year on year.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and i'll add. so we don't expect covid lockdowns to repeat in china. that's a wildcard. we've been surprised there before other agreements that could happen again.
we don't think -- we're not expecting that. but that was a big unfavorable in the first half, particularly in the second quarter that we expect to correct and normalize as we go through the second half.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so maybe just to help clarify that. as we think about the year-to-date second quarter or year-to-date kind of performance. what's been the realized cci savings year-to-date relative to the 85% that you talked about for the full year? first, i don't think i heard a specific number in terms of what the realized cost inflation has been year-to-date just relative to that high teens number that you've targeted or you've expected for the full year.
and i guess just any way to help dimensionalize some of the -- you give the brand marketing piece, but other sg&a, just where that magnitude of kind of tightening the box strings there and how much that can contribute in the second half?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this is weighted to the second half, adam. that's all i'm going to say.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, i appreciate that. i appreciate that color. i'll pass it on.

our next question comes from the line of peter galbo with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thank you for taking the questions. 
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
lawrence kurzius, i just wanted to circle back actually to andrew's question around private label. and going back to the slides, you do have a section here talking about more entry price points. and i'm just curious, is that a response to what you see as impending, more share shifting to private label. and so you feel like you need more entry price points? or is it something else? you talked about inflating cost baskets and maybe in other categories like proteins.
and i noticed here you're talking about entry price points on things like grill mates and lawyr's, which tend to be more tied to protein. so just curious to kind of get the thoughts around that that...
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, this is -- that really doesn't have anything to do with private label. but has to do with -- there's a concern that consumers may be under pressure as we were seeing some early signs that consumers may be feeling some economic pressure. it's no secret that things like gas prices are up. our customers are talking -- retailer customers are talking about consumers feeling some pressure.
and we have some concern that between the inflationary environment and the high risk of inflation -- sorry, that's the wrong word there -- the high risk of recession as we go into the second half and even into 2023, that we want to be able to make sure that consumers, especially in the lower half of the income scale, are still being served and have access to our categories. our goal is to have products that appeal to consumers at every price point across the whole category. and between our new product launches, our brand marketing and our brand marketing activity, we are taking a tone that tries to address that pressure to consumer. we've got -- i know we're kind of hitting time and general mills is probably talking right now, but brendan's got a lot of color that he can add on this question and i'd like to give him a chance to.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
well, i think, lawrence, i think you hit it largely right. we're trying to make sure that our portfolio and our assortment is really geared toward what consumers are starting to face. and it could very well be price points that are lower in terms of smaller sizes. i would say though, also, there's another dynamic on the other end which is happening, which is we actually see even more consumers switching to larger sizes, looking for more value.
and so it's playing out really on both ends. and so those are things that we're reacting to and making sure that we drive even more distribution and items in our assortment that serve those needs and those price points that consumers are looking for.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and maybe just a quick one. lawrence, you did mention i think that packaging tightness was impacting a certain couple of categories in u.s.
spices and seasonings. just any more color there? what specifically brands or categories we should be looking at? just if that starts to improve, would we see another...
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't want to get too specific, but i also don't really want to call out our suppliers with whom we're trying to have a constructive -- competitors either for that matter. but we had some trouble with glass for our organic spices in our gourmet range that i think we have resolved now. and we've had some ongoing challenges on some other -- more of the rigid container kind of packaging and mostly in the u.s., frankly.

kasey jenkins
good morning. this is kasey jenkins, chief strategy officer and senior vice president, investor relations. thank you for joining today's third quarter earnings call. to accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.
with me this morning are lawrence kurzius, chairman and ceo; brendan foley, president and coo; and mike smith, executive vice president and cfo. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. the nature of those non-gaap financial measures and the related reconciliations to the gaap results are included in this morning's press release and slides. in our comments, certain percentages are rounded.
please refer to our presentation for complete information. today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those projected. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or other factors.
please refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more information. i will now turn the discussion over to lawrence.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. third quarter sales increased 3% from the year-ago period as anticipated. in constant currency, sales grew 6%, reflecting 10% growth from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% decline from the kitchen basics divestiture, a 1% decline attributable to the exit of low-margin business in india and the consumer business in russia, and a 2% decline in all other volume and product mix.
our underlying third quarter growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, as well as the effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, third quarter sales grew at a constant currency three-year compounded annual growth rate, or cagr, of 7%, reflecting the sustained momentum in our business across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. moving to profit, adjusted operating income was down 12%, or 11% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share was down 14%. during the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued, and recovery of certain constrained materials is taking longer than expected.
we continue to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in our flavor solutions segment. while in our consumer segment, where demand moderated from elevated consumption trends more quickly than expected, we are experiencing lower than optimal operating leverage. across the supply chain, we remain focused on managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies. so, the normalization of our supply chain costs is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin and profit realization in the current period.
over the coming months, we will be aggressively eliminating supply chain inefficiencies. importantly, as we had expected in the third quarter, our price increases are catching up with the pace of cost inflation in both segments. we began to recover the cost inflation that had been outpacing our pricing actions and other levers, most significantly in the consumer segment. we expect this will continue into the next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time.
before discussing our third quarter segment performance in more detail, i'd like to comment on our supply chain plans, starting on slide 5. we have a focused plan in flight that leverages the discipline of our established comprehensive continuous improvement, or cci program, to ensure that we are able to flexibly support customer demand, both where it has been sustained at higher levels and where it has moderated, while eliminating inefficiencies and normalizing both our cost structure and inventory levels. our actions are well underway. our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth.
there are areas of our business that have sustained high levels of demand for an extended period, and our supply chain has been pressured to meet this demand. we have several initiatives in progress that will increase our capacity, strengthen our supply chain resiliency, and, importantly, enable us to service our customers so they can grow their business. for example, we're investing in additional flavor solutions seasoning capacity, which will be online in early 2023. we're expanding fullness footprint to support our flavor growth.
we recently opened our new u.k. peterborough flavor solutions manufacturing facility to support our strong growth momentum with quick service restaurants. and just earlier this week, the first pallet were shipped from our new maryland logistics center. from a cost perspective, as we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we have incurred additional costs above inflation, service our customers, and have seen inefficiencies develop in our supply chain.
these are costs we have absorbed. we have not passed on to customers our pricing actions. we are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs with a significant benefit in 2023. we're moving aggressively to take these costs and inefficiencies out, as well as normalized inventory levels that have built up.
some of our actions include investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in bottleneck areas to enable better customer service and repatriation of production from excessive use of co-packers. we're returning to more normal shift schedules and reducing our spend on expensive surge capacity. we're already seeing the benefit of lower overtime and temporary labor reductions. in this more normalized environment, as well as through customer collaboration, we are already beginning to reduce expedited freight costs and less than truckload shipping costs, as well as other transportation inefficiencies.
we're resolving raw material and packaging supply issues. for example, they're beyond the shortages of glass bottle and certain organic spices, which impacted supply of our u.s. core main line. a supplier facility closure announced in september broke the discontinuation of a component of our dry recipe mix packaging.
and through our quick qualification of alternative supply, we mitigated a major disruption during the fourth quarter. and long-running shortage of french's mustard bottle will be resolved in the first half of 2023 as new models come online as a second supplier. and from an inventory perspective, we're also executing on plans to return to historical safety stock levels, which were raised to protect against supply disruption. we expect the impact of our actions to normalize our supply chain cost, increase our efficiency and ability to meet demand, lower our inventory level, and, importantly, increase our profit realization beginning in the first half of 2023.
we have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years with the peak disruption experienced in the third quarter of last year. since then, there has been steady improvement, building progress and bolstering our confidence in our plan to enhance our operational performance and optimize our cost structure. but we will always prioritize meeting our customers' needs. i'm encouraged by our disciplined approach to resolving the increased costs within our supply chain.
we've continued to define and quantify specific actions within our plans as we've -- seen since we shared we would be driving the elimination of the supply chain inefficiencies in our pre-announcement last month. we look forward to sharing more details and progress with you in january when we provide our 2023 outlook. now, moving to third quarter business updates for each of our segments. starting with our consumer segment on slide 6 and the status of our pricing actions, our third quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all three regions, with an acceleration of effective pricing in the quarter versus the first half of the year, in line with what we expected.
while broad pressure on consumers cost of living from inflation, which heightened during our third quarter, has resulted in higher price elasticity than we originally anticipated, our elasticities remain lower than historical levels. and our most recent pricing actions, which in the u.s. took effect as we began our fourth quarter, we focused on areas that are less elastic and did not take pricing on some products where we had seen the highest elasticity. now, for some further highlights of our region, starting with the americas.
our total u.s. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our iri consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 4%, in line with our shipments. and over the last three years, since 2019, consumption has grown at a three-year cagr of 8%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels. in early august, we divested our kitchen basics business.
we consistently grew this brand over the years. but as it was the only u.s. brand we had in the stock and profile, our resources were better focused on core categories where we have leading brands. demand has remained high with strong growth in the majority of our categories.
spices and seasonings has been one of our strongest categories in the past three years. and as a result, we are lapping all-time highs in consumption. this has created challenging comparisons in some product lines, such as baking-related items, which have returned to a pre-pandemic level unlike most of our categories. grilling-related items were impacted versus last year by high meat prices, although grilling is still strong versus pre-pandemic.
sales conditions continue to improve as seen in a recipe mix share performance for the fourth consecutive quarter of share gains. our spices and seasoning share was pressured by service-related distribution losses, the shortage of certain packaging items, as well as certain organic spices, which has largely been resolved, and some trading down by consumers who remain under pressure from broad-based inflation. we are using our category and revenue management capabilities to strengthen our spices and seasoning presence on shelf. the strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution, which we're beginning to realize now.
in emea, we continue to have solid share performance of herbs, spices, and seasonings in the u.k., eastern europe and italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in france. we are continuing to gain share of frank's redhot in the uk, and we are beginning to build momentum with cholula, as we expand that brand into this market. for the quarter and year to date versus last year, as well as since 2019, we are driving the uk hot sauce category growth. our vahine brand of homemade dessert products in france, a product line unique to our emea region, has flowed as we have seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level in emea, too, again, unlike our other categories.
turning to the asia-pacific region, last year, the region experienced supply chain challenges such as ocean freight capacity constraints and lapping that impact contributed to growth in the third quarter. additionally, following an extended lockdown in the second quarter, covid restrictions in shanghai and some other cities throughout china, eased as we began the third quarter, resulting in trade and pantry replenishment contributing to growth. recently, several cities in central china, which is the primary market of our wuhan operations, have experienced new covid-related lockdown, and we're continually monitoring the situation. overall, our china performance is on track with our expectation.
across all regions in our consumer segment, we are achieving the price realization we expected, and we're executing on our proven growth strategies, pivoting action plans as needed based on our consumer insights and the environment, we continue to invest behind our brands. we increased brand marketing investments in the third quarter and have additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. in addition to our highly effective and inspiring holiday messaging, we've pivoted our digital messaging to emphasize value and show consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars without sacrificing flavor. we are focusing our innovation efforts to meet the needs of consumers concerned about their budgets.
in the americas, we have launched the new lawry's-branded opening price-point range of everyday 10 spices. and our large-size format, super deal, is one of the best performing product lines as consumers are looking for greater value. this format size is approximately a 40% better value per ounce than the smaller sizes. we've also launched large-size resealable pouches of top-selling items in markets across all regions.
in terms of category management, we're collaborating with our customers to ensure the right assortment and price points on shelf to optimize category performance and increase profitability for our customers. and as always, we have a strong merchandising program planned for the holiday season. we are confident in our brand marketing investments, innovation, and category management initiatives, which will continue to drive strong growth. turning to flavor solutions on slide 8, our sales performance for the quarter was strong, with growth led by our pricing actions in all three regions with an increase in our effective pricing versus the first half of the year as we expected.
now, for some regional highlights. in the americas, strong growth was driven by snacks, seasonings, savory flavors, and branded food service products. demand continues to strengthen the branded food service restaurant and institutional food service customers, as mobility and strong summer travel continue to fuel consumption. and importantly, we also are expanding distribution.
in emea, growth remains strong across our entire customer base. our third quarter growth was led by strong quick-service restaurant, or qsr, momentum in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution in our customers' promotional activity. and we're seeing an acceleration of demand in branded food service, as customers shift to more economical formats. our full spectrum of solutions across price points is driving growth.
we were winning in both regions with our new product momentum. in americas, growth from new products contributed approximately 25% more growth in flavors in the third quarter than the year-ago period, driven by beverage, savory snacks, and performance nutrition flavors. we're continuing to win share in these categories. and in emea, our third quarter new product launches accelerated versus earlier in the year.
and for the full year, we expect new product introductions to outpace 2021. we are fueling future growth. in apz, we're driving further menu penetration with our qsr customers wanting new limited-time offers, as well as realizing growth and strong performance of their core menu items with flavor. in many cases, we are the heat in their spicy offerings.
overall, flavor solutions has remained strong. and for certain parts of our business in the americas and emea regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand. and as i said earlier, we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. we appreciate our customers working with us, and we see light ahead.
now, some summary comments before turning it over to mike. turning to slide 9, global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great, fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. we continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brand, and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate.
mccormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion, for our product, and our customers' products, and are driving growth. we are end-to-end flavor. we remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies, and values that have made us so successful.
we have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. our solid track record of achieving our long-term objectives highlights the resiliency of our business through a variety of market conditions, as well as our focus on sales growth and profit realization. the long-term fundamentals that drove our industry leading historical performance remain strong. the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the global dynamic environment.
the compounding benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance, and people continue to position mccormick to drive sales growth and balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins and realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. the teamwork of our mccormick employees drive our momentum and success. and i want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. and now, i will turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone. starting on slide 12, our top-line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, including a 1% unfavorable impact from the kitchen basics divestiture, as well as a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in india and the consumer business in russia. in our consumer segment, we drove constant currency sales growth of 4%, with 10% related to pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% impact from the kitchen basics divestiture, as well as lower volume, with the exits of low-margin business in india and the consumer business in russia contributing a combined 1% impact to the lower volume. on a three-year basis, our third quarter constant currency sales cagr was 6%.
on slide 13, consumer sales in the americas increased 3% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by a decline in volume, as well as a 1% impact from the kitchen basics divestiture. as lawrence mentioned, the volume decline was impacted not only by elasticities, but also by constrained supply of certain input materials, primarily packaging items. over the past three years, constant currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 6%. in emea, constant currency consumer sales declined 1%, which included a 3% unfavorable impact from lower sales in russia.
growth in other markets was driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume, with the most significant volume impact attributable to lower sales of vahine homemade dessert products. over the past three years, emea's constant currency sales grew at a 3% cagr. constant currency consumer sales in the asia-pacific region grew 10%, including a 7% unfavorable impact from the exit of low-margin business in india. as lawrence mentioned, growth was driven by higher volume, mainly attributable to trade and pantry replenishments in china, following the extended shanghai lockdown last quarter, as well as the region lapping supply chain challenges in the year-ago period.
pricing actions in all markets across the region also contributed to growth. on a three-year basis, apz's third quarter constant currency sales grew at a 4% cagr. turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 16, we grew third quarter constant currency sales 10%, primarily due to pricing actions, with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth. third quarter constant currency sales for the last three years grew at an 8% cagr.
in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 10%, driven by pricing. higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. higher demand from branded food service customers also contributed to growth. over the past three years, constant currency sales in the americas grew at a cagr of 8%.
in emea, we drove 11% constant currency sales growth, with 7% related to price actions and 4% volume and mix. emea's flavor solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to lower sales in russia, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with qsr, branded food service, and packaged food and beverage company customers. over the past three years, emea's constant currency sales growth was 9% cagr. in the asia-pacific region, flavor solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase.
growth was driven by higher sales to qsr customers, in part due to the timing of the promotional activities. apz grew constant currency sales at a 6% cagr over the past three years. as seen on slide 20, adjusted gross profit margin declined 320 basis points in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. let me spend a moment on the significant drivers.
first, almost 80% of this decline, approximately 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. next, i'll cover the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margin. in our flavor solutions segment, we have continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand for certain parts of that business. and there has also been an unfavorable impact from the start-up and dual-running costs as we transition production to our new u.k.
peterborough manufacturing facility. in our consumer segment, where demand has moderated more quickly than we expected, we are experiencing lower operating leverage. overall, while the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer-than-expected pressure in gross margin, we are taking actions to normalize our costs, as lawrence mentioned, which we are confident will be reflected in our 2023 gross margin. partially offsetting these impacts i just mentioned were our cci-led cost savings, where we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year.
and finally, of note, in line with our expectations, the impact of our pricing actions in the third quarter began outpacing cost inflation in both segments, more significantly in the consumer segment. we expect pricing to continue outpacing inflation into next year, as we plan to fully offset inflation over time. overall, our cost recovery and gross margin improvement will vary by region and segment, with a slower flavor solutions recovery. importantly, though, we have now passed the inflection point with significant gross margin improvement since last quarter, driven by our consumer segment performance, and, we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter.
now, moving to slide 21. selling, general, and administrative expenses, or sg&a, were comparable to the third quarter of last year, with higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments, offset by lower employee benefit expenses. as a percent of net sales, sg&a declined 60 basis points. the net impact of the factors i just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021.
in the consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 1% in constant currency; and in the flavor solutions segment, a decline of 34%. turning to income taxes on slide 22. our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 14.1% in the year-ago period. both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year.
at the bottom line, as shown on slide 23, third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.80 for the year-ago period. the decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. a favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio in the third quarter was fully offset by the impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year. on slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and a quarter-end balance sheet.
our cash flow from operations was $250 million through the third quarter of 2022, which is lower than the same period last year. this decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. we returned $298 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $167 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter. our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
while our fourth quarter has historically generated our highest cash flow from operations, based on our current profit outlook and working capital position, we do not expect to delever to our targeted net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2022. we remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. with our improving gross margin, as well as our plan to normalize our supply chain cost and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt. now, turning to our 2022 financial outlook on slide 25.
we are projecting strong top-line growth, with profit impacted by cost inflation and supply chain challenges. we also expect there will be a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. on the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 3% to 5%. we expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing.
while we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by price elasticities, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels given our focused approach led by consumer insights. our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the divestiture of our kitchen basics business. the demand disruptions experienced in china and the exit of our consumer business in russia, as well as continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. we plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement growth plans.
we are projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 350 to 300 basis points lower than 2021, primarily driven by our flavor solutions segment. given the rapidly escalating cost environment this year, cost inflation outpaced pricing in the first half of the year. we expect pricing to outpace inflation in the second half of the year and continue into next year. this adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, higher supply chain costs, lower operating leverage, and unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impact from pricing and cci-led cost savings.
as a reminder, we have priced to offset dollar cost increases. this has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. we expect our adjusted operating income to decline 11% to 9% in constant currency. in addition to our gross margin impacts i just mentioned, this projection also includes our cci-led cost -- total cost savings target of approximately $85 million and a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments compared to 2021.
we are projecting our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. this outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%. we are projecting our 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68 as compared to $3.05 in 2021. this projection includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the kitchen basics business.
as we currently progress in our fourth quarter, we are confident in delivering our 2022 outlook, continuing our strong top-line growth trajectory and as our guidance implies, delivering fourth quarter operating margin expansion while executing on a focused plan to drive improvement in our cost structure. we are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs, or approximately a 150 basis point impact to our operating margin. with our proven track record of delivering cci-led savings to fuel growth investments and expand our operating margin, we are leveraging the discipline of the cci program to aggressively eliminate costs and inefficiencies. overall, we are confident our focus on profit realization will drive margin improvement.
and while parts of our plan to optimize our cost structure will take longer than others, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of our actions in the first half of 2023. we look forward to sharing more details on progress with you in january when we provide our 2023 outlook.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, i'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 26. our third quarter sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. our sales growth momentum is strong.
the challenges in our supply chain have taken longer to normalize, we have now passed an inflection point. we have begun to recover the cost inflation that has been outpacing our pricing actions while executing on a plan to aggressively eliminate supply chain costs, and we expect 2022 fourth operating margin expansion and continued improvement into 2023. our long-term performance, including through periods of volatility, has been industry-leading, and long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remain strong. we have a proven track record of execution and are confident we will successfully navigate this dynamic environment for our future sustainable growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.
now, let's turn to your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thanks so much.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi. good morning, ken, by the way.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. you highlighted that you've past the inflection point, right, where your pricing is now ahead of your costs. and this, of course, is natural, right, given the timing and not unexpected.
but, you know, one of the pushbacks we hear in the industry is that larger retail customers, as they start to, i guess, maybe notice these margin trends, they'll start to ask for a bigger piece of the profit pie. so, i guess my question is, you know, to what extent do you expect sort of these gross margin net tailwinds to be sustainable? or, you know, is it reasonable to expect maybe some pressure from customers as they see their vendors' margins starting to get better?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think that there's always some tension when you're talking about pricing and margins with customers. and so, i don't want to get into anything with any one specific customer. but right now, all of our customers recognize that inflation is ongoing, and we, you know, continue to have, i'd say, productive pricing discussions with our customers. we just did take another round that is effective here at fourth quarter.
and we're really not seeing that kind of pushback right now.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think the reality, ken, is we're still recovering. you know, our pace of pricing has caught up now with cost. and we -- we'll recover dollar for dollar in 2023. but, you know, there is a trend that is going in the right direction.
and obviously, you know, as we look at 2023, we look at, you know, what's the cost environment, things like that, we need to go again next year, but that's still kind of --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i think particularly on the flavor solutions side of the business, we have -- we still have, you know, more work to do.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then for my follow-up, you're guiding to at least $100 million of incremental cost savings. it's not a small number.
so, i just wanted to get a little bit of clarification. how much of that is incremental to ongoing cci? and how much of that is derived from maybe a normalization of certain factors, such as inventories versus what you would consider more, i guess, discrete savings beyond that?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, first of all, all of this is incremental to our normal cci program using the processes and the organization that drives our cci program to actually execute on these. but this is incremental savings that we -- although, you know, some of the -- i would characterize as a one-time take out the -- it goes straight to run rate. these are incremental costs that we have incurred due to extensive search capacity, some of the things we talked about in our prepared remarks. you know, overtime, temporary labor, and efficient shift, you know, excessive use of co-packers, a lot of premium transportation charges, we do expect to get that out of our system, get back to our pre-pandemic operating standards.
and we would expect -- while this is a, you know, one-time takeout, it goes straight to run rate.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
understood. thanks so much. yup, very clear.
operator
our next question is from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. so, flavor solutions is really the division that has stumbled the most. i mean, when i look at profit this year compared to like pre-pandemic, it's well below your pre-pandemic levels.
so, can i assume that most of the $100 million in savings is -- or recovery is going to happen there? and then my second question is, i remember years and years ago that the flavor solutions had problems because it was trying to do too many things for too many customers. it had spread itself too thin. it needed eventually to have a rationalization of its customer base. and i wanted to make sure that that's not possibly one of the root causes today.
you've grown your sales a lot. do you feel like the organization is capable of still getting back to like 12% operating margin across all of those customers?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. you know, i think that stumble is the wrong way to characterize it. i think that we're a bit of a victim of our own success. you know, we've won a lot of new business, and we prioritized keeping our customers in stock and supplying them.
and that has put a lot of pressure on our supply chain in a few areas. and we've got projects underway to address, you know, kind of a normalization of production and through capacity additions. you know, some of these wins are substantial, and we've had real brick-and-mortar projects that take a couple of years to put into place that are coming online right now and that are going to get at a lot of the, you know, extraordinary costs. there's some parts of our business, the 24/7 shifts that we've gotten out of most of our business, you know, we're still doing that in a lot of our that's why i wouldn't say a lot in parts of our flavor solutions business, and that is a less efficient ship pattern even though it does, you know, get you some capacity to be an example of expensive surge capacity.
but, you know, we've got new seasonings capacity coming online in the americas, some of it now, some of it in the first -- early part of 2023. we're starting up a new flavor solutions plant in the u.k. we've got, you know, expanded distribution, you know, that's shipping really starting to ship right now. and so, you know, i think that, you know, we've got a lot going for us in flavor solutions to support that strong growth in a more efficient way.
as a margin issue on flavor solutions, partly is just the way our contractual arrangements work with our customers, you know, there is a pass-through mechanism for the major raw materials that go into their products. there's a lag to it. in times when inflation was, you know, 1%, 2%, 3%, you know, that flag really wasn't important. but this year, where it's been double-digit, it has been important.
and we are going, you know, to catch that up.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think, remember, we've talked about this before, over half of the dilution this year is due to the, you know, cost versus pricing. so, that's just the math that we'll get back over time. also, you know, these projects, lawrence mentioned, there's a lot of double running costs as we bring those big projects up like u.k. peterborough that eventually will go away.
so, that will help the margins, too. to your point, though, about -- are we spread too thin? i was actually at the flavor division back in 2005 when that was identified. there's no comparison to today. it's really focused and, brendan, why don't you --
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
i was just going to say, mike, one thing i would add there, rob, is the composition and the profile of our business is so different to 2005. and this -- our strategy to keep driving and evolving the business toward that higher value-added portfolio is what you're seeing in our business, you know, portfolio today. and so, there's a very different, i think, set of conditions compared to, you know, the point you referenced.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and we have done a lot of portfolio pruning behind the scenes as we -- especially as we went through, you know, these last three years, where the extraordinary growth, you know, that we have in the parts of the business that we're focused on, you know, more than made up for parts of the business where we were getting out of, you know, low-margin, high-touch businesses. and i think it's been a self-reinforcing strategy. the migration of our business more and more toward, you know, the value-added, technically insulated, and flavor end of the spectrum has made our product wins stickier and our r&d teams more able to work on new business, not focused on constantly rewinning bid business.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. i'm sorry to bring up 2005, but we're all old, and we all remember it. so, maybe just one follow-up. of the $70 million or so of profit decline this year in flavor solutions, can you quantify how much of that is just pricing catch-up?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would say -- i wouldn't -- i think the bigger bucket is actually some of the excess costs that we've talked about, and which actually would have driven more sales if we could supply it. but the excess cost that we -- you know, for the reason we called down our pre-announcement was we haven't been able to get those out of the system yet. you know, pricing is a bit behind. i mean, the thing that gives us the comfort that we're going to recover more margin flavor solutions is because we've seen it in consumer.
you know, consumer is turning positive from a gross margin and an operating profit perspective as pricing wave comes through, and you'll see the same in flavor solutions. but i don't have the exact number for you.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
our next question is from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. hey, thank you, and good morning.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
picking up on that last thread, on the pricing catch-up in flavor solutions, can you talk a little bit about the expected timing of that and cadence of that? because it seems like, you know, most of it or a good portion of it should be, i think, foreseeable just based on the timing of, certainly, contracted adjustments in pricing and contract renewals and that kind of thing. so, is it a -- should we be expecting a relatively smooth catch-up from here? or, you know, is it -- is there a reason to believe that you can -- that the catch-up happens on a more accelerated timing.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd rather describe it more in terms of our gross margin trajectory than to talk about pricing specifically because i'm worried that it's going to get into things that might have set our customers. but you can see the margin trajectory on this business beginning to turn. we talked about an inflection point. you know, flavor solutions margins have been ticking down, you know, through the second quarter of the year.
they're turning -- the year-on-year comparison has narrowed in the third quarter. and we expect it to continue to narrow and begin a recovery as we go through next year.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think from a dollar perspective, like i said before, for both consumer and flavor solutions business, we will catch up on the cost next year. we just took branded food service. that's a part of labor solutions, along with our consumer business, at the beginning of the quarter. that will be a positive going into next year rapidly.
so, yes, there's no like one big bag, you catch up. it's over time. but in 2023, we will catch up.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. ok. and on the manufacturing start-up costs, are those -- you know, i guess, what inning are we in there? and how much of that remains versus is in the rearview?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you know, i would say -- i mean, from a -- you're always going to have some of these programs just to say that. so, you're always going to have some of this. i think this year is kind of a high watermark that we should get some get in next year. but, you know, some of these programs take, you know, a bit of time to get fully, fully done.
these are big programs. i mean the project -- we just shipped our first panel, as lawrence said, out of our big northeast distribution center. but, you know, we want to -- over time, into 2023, we'll be moving parts of our business into that. so, you know, there'll be a bit of inefficiency there.
but --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and i want to just emphasize that the things that we talked about on the call in terms of getting out the -- on our prepared remarks in terms of getting at the cost, for example. so, i don't want to overly focus on any one particular thing and give it too much weight. you know, we were sharing, you know, examples.
and when we next report in january, we'll be able to give some progress updates on those exact examples, as well as for other actions.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thank you. if i could, just one little housekeeping, sorry if i missed it but -- just was there anything notable that caused -- that resulted in reported ebit this quarter coming in above what you had pre-announced at quarter close? just anything as you close the books that was --
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, like we said, we've preannounced -- we haven't closed our books yet, so these are all estimates. and we felt pretty good where we landed. i mean, there was a couple of things. tax came in a little bit more favorable at about penny, some other sg&a things given a little bit more favorable, but nothing material and so --
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
no one --
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
landed right where we thought.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, when we pre-announced, it was our -- it was --
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we had a little bit more visibility on the sales versus profit. and, you know, between q3 and q4, there's a little shift.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. ok. thanks so much.

our next question is from the line of chris growe with stifel. please proceed with your question.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good morning.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, chris. sorry, it was hard to get in.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. no, no worries. no, thank you for accommodating my question. i appreciate it.
i just wanted to give a couple of, i guess, follow-up questions. i just want to be sure on that lag in pricing in flavor solutions. when we talked some of the pass-along features of that business, that had typically been like a one-quarter lag. is that still the case? or have you caught up now when you talk about pricing being over inflation, have you caught up with that? and i guess, i just want to also understand, was that a factor weighing on profit in the quarter? or was it more just the supply chain challenges?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, of course, it was a factor weighing on profit in the quarter end and has been all year. you know, again, every customer has got a different contractual arrangements. i think about a quarter lag is a good way to think about it. but remember, costs keep coming in.
i mean, we didn't just get, you know, cost inflation, you know, on january 1 and price for it. you know, these costs have been steadily increasing, you know, all year, and in fact, continue to increase. the inflationary outlook has not settled. so, there's been a bit of a -- we've gotten -- we've passed costs through, but there's been a bit of chasing it, as costs have continued to go up.
i'm going to let brendan comment on this a little further.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
well, it's true. i think just, you know, the thing i would key in on is there is -- unlike, let's say, our consumer and our flavors -- our branded food service business, there's not, you know, sort of one moment in time where, you know, that pricing is, therefore, effective in the business. and so that's another way to maybe think about it, chris. and i think just to build on part of your question, you know, certainly, supply chain, as we've been talking about quite a bit in the prepared remarks, you know, were certainly an influence on how we're looking at that.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then just to understand, if i'm hearing it properly. but like the pricing should accelerate in the fourth quarter, it sounds like there will be, again, some continued catch-up in pricing.
i guess that's true for flavor solutions. as i think about consumer, is that one where we should expect incremental pricing based on what you've announced so far. not asking for anything new there, but i also want to understand maybe how you're utilizing promotional spending there, you know, as a means of trying to trying to attack those price gap issues in some areas of the business there.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think you've got -- i'm going to try and unpack that in pieces. we have been guiding all year. and it -- and you can see it coming through now and not just in our reported numbers, but also through the scanner. but we would have more pricing in effect in the second half of the year, especially going into the fourth quarter than we have -- you know, than we did in the early part of the year.
we've -- in the americas, you know, this year, you know, taken a number of rounds of pricing that included the most recent one being here right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. and so, there is more pricing in effect now about our consumer business primarily there. and so, you can see that coming through now. and really, other than the contractual windows that we were just talking about in flavor solutions, we largely have our actions for this year in place as we're looking ahead to 2023 now.
i think that, in asia, we've got one more round that goes into effect actually this month. but really, our 2022 actions are away. and i gave such a long answer to that, but i forgot the second part of your question. but i'm going to let brendan answer it.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
so, i think where you were going was just looking for some context around promotional spending. and i think, you know, the context we provide is as we go into the holiday, you know, we feel really good about our supply. we have a strong program, you know, planned for the holiday season, as we would, you know, every year. but it certainly feels, you know, i think, a little bit more robust now compared to, let's say, '21 and '20 just because we're in a better situation from the standpoint of the overall context in the market.
so, we are turning back on promotions where we feel really confident about supply, and we're looking at the holiday season that way. those choices are not necessarily connected to any pricing decisions we're making in the market, but really to support of the business and helping to drive the category for our retailers.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and i would say that our supply situation on the consumer business, you know, going to holiday is the best it's been in the last several years.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. thanks for all that context. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your question.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. good morning, everybody.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi. good morning, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
maybe to start off, i think when you had pre-announced results for the quarter, one of the factors that you had highlighted in the consumer business was that sort of private label price points at some retailers on shelf had not yet really sort of moved upward, leading to some price gaps that get wider maybe than you'd like or had been anticipated. and if i missed this, i apologize. i didn't know if that you've seen any movement there yet, or have heard of any movement that's likely to happen on that front.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. andrew, no one has asked that yet. so, i'm glad that you did. you know, not only a very short time since we pre-announced, and so we don't have a lot of new information on consumer behavior or on retailer behavior.
i'll let brendan give some color on that, and then i'll take it back.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think, andrew, things are largely, you know, consistent with what we had discussed or shared, you know, broadly within the last four weeks. so, we haven't really seen a lot of new information or data. they seem -- this price gap seem to be kind of, you know, holding in the very same range that we talked about before. and -- but, you know, we still are a leading supplier of private label into the category.
and, you know, we're passing those price increases along to, you know, customers just as we have on branded products. and that's a retailer-by-retailer decision, i think, on, you know, what gets realized itself. but in the meanwhile, we're still driving a lot of that value programming that we had talked about, whether -- not only our messaging, but also, you know, we're seeing a lot of lift in -- you know, some of those parts of our portfolio, you know, tend to drive more value. we offer -- our offerings are really across the spectrum, you know, that would meet consumers' needs.
and we're seeing growth on the premium end, we're seeing growth on the value end. in parts of our business like gourmet garden, which tend to be on the premium end, we're actually doing really well, you know, in this context. and then we see our value sizes like super deal performing very strongly, you know, also off-shelf and in the market. and then we're introducing, you know, more value into the market through this opening price point, lawry's program.
and we're also doing that in other parts of our -- in other markets around the world where we're -- you know, and many of them were launching resealable pouches that are larger than usual and allow consumers to kind of realize, you know, more value that way. but that's probably the added context i would share, you know, since the last month.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and, andrew, it isn't exactly what you've asked, but it gives -- give me a chance to talk about this a little bit. i want to emphasize that, you know, we have in our offering items for every price point and every retailer strategy and category from the premium end, all the way down to opening price points and private label, we spent a fair bit of time talking about, you know, the consumer that's under pressure. and rightly so, you know, we are concerned about pressure on the consumer, especially, the consumers on the lower half of the income spectrum.
and we want to make sure that our products are accessible and approachable. but the gourmet and premium end of our business is still very strong. and sometimes, those price gaps can be exaggerated. and brendan mentioned large size and super deal.
the nielsen data is a pretty blunt instrument when it reports unit price. it doesn't catch the fact that, you know, some of these value packs are really big and carry a high price point. if you adjust that out, you know, the lower-size packs that are growing strongly for us and that price gap actually narrows quite a bit.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
that's a very helpful perspective. thank you. and then i know we're running short on time. just a quick one.
obviously, we're not at a point where you're going to get too specific at all about next year, of course. but, you know, with sort of the inflection that's starting to happen in pricing, the new cost saves, you know, and margin recovery actions that you've kind of highlighted today, i guess, consensus already has mccormick sort of getting back to what we'll call more of an on-algorithm type of earnings growth next year, particularly as you would deem, i think, you know, a bunch of the things you talked about impacting this year is somewhat more transitory, you know, as you improve them going forward. so, i didn't know if there were even just any broad comments around that, you know, whether there's a need, you think, to lean in right on the marketing side going into next year, just given whatever the value orientation of the consumer or some of the new product innovations you've got planned? or just things larger puts and takes that we should sort of think about, you know, as given how, i guess, the street has already started to sort of lock in expectations for next year? thanks so much.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, i will start with the caveat that we're not going to give any guidance for 2023. right now, i've got -- everyone is standing around here with -- holding their breath -- whether i'm going to say something rash about that. but -- so, it is a bit early for that. and i appreciate saying confidence in the investment community that's reflected in those consensus outlook.
but there are some big puts and takes. i'm going to let mike talk about those.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. obviously, a big wild part for next year is the inflation environment. so, we're in the process now actually rolling up budgets and things like that, taking a look that drives pricing actions. obviously, some of the other puts and takes you think about, you know, interest expense.
obviously, some of the actions we took this year might be a negative for next year. this cost pro we talked about, which we're going to give you a lot more detail in january. so, you know, i'd say, right now, there's so many big moving parts, it would be hard even to give you any guidance about.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
and frankly, incentive comp has to be rebuilt.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
yup. thank you.
operator
our next question is from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning. so, a lot of ground has been covered.
i wanted to just come back to flavor solutions quickly and just the way you'd characterize kind of the business performance on the strong demand. and i guess i'm trying to -- volume mix in the quarter was up 80 basis points. and so, i'm just trying to get a little bit more color on kind of the pieces within the flavor solutions business because it's not really one business. it's a collection of a bunch of them.
it would seem from the way you characterize some areas of strength that maybe some of the higher-value flavor businesses were at or below kind of segment average growth? and just, a, is that the right calibration? and b, just any color on the growth of the -- some of the different pieces?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, i'll start with the pick of the part of it that was weak. we had strong performance on flavor solutions in that segment across the globe and really all segments. i'm sorry, i'll -- not to say all regions and all of the pieces of it. well --
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
maybe a little bit out -- maybe we did talk about a month ago, i mean, some of the challenges on flavor solutions this year were cost related to plaque constraints. we could have sold more. we could have had higher volumes than you noted. so, i think from that perspective, you know, some of the actions we've talked about it more capacity will help.
but the demand is very strong.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
demand is very strong.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. i just -- i guess, relative to historical performance of that business, the 80 basis points of volume mix growth. and i know there's noisiness in the comps with covid recovery, and it's a lumpy business that doesn't always -- usually that business could be stronger than 80 basis points of volume mix.
so, i'm trying to get the calibration of that.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we had enormous price -- 10% pricing, we feel pretty good about.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then just quickly on sg&a, and you alluded to in thinking about '23 a little bit. but it would seem like the way the gross margin and ebit guidance lays out implied for the fourth quarter that total sg&a is going to be down high single digits. a, is that kind of the right calibration? and within that, just how much is incentive comp resetting lower talk about kind of the declines in sg&a dollars that you've seen this year?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, sg&a, you're right, it's going to be down in the quarter, and it's primarily driven by the incentive comp. we're also getting higher fixed cost leverage, too, as you think about it. but, yeah.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, is most of that decline in incentive comp, as we think about the headwind, that would be rolling into next year?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean we adjust incentive comp every quarter, so i wouldn't take one quarter then try to extrapolate the next year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. i appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our final question is from the line of peter galbo with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. just two really quick ones for me. maybe just to pick up on adam's question there.
mike, i just wanted to clarify, the operating margin comment for the fourth quarter of operating margin expansion, that was a year-over-year comment in the fourth quarter, not a sequential?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think both.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
both. ok. that's helpful. and then just a broader question on the -- just thinking about the cost savings for next year.
i know we spent a lot of time talking about that. but just as we think about like repatriating production, surge capacity coming down, normalizing inventory levels, like, is there a way to quantify, i would imagine the there's probably a volume impact that comes with that? you know, you'll get the benefit on the cost side, but maybe there's an offset a little bit, at least on topline on volume. is there any way to quantify that at this point?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i don't think that's what we're saying at all. and i think we've quantified the cost benefit, but i don't think that there's an impact on volume at all. i mean, this is a normalization and that we went through this year. and i don't think that has an impact.
of course, we kind of don't want to get into 2023 guidance. but whatever -- that would all be reflected in whatever guidance we give for next year. and i do want to emphasize that we've spent a lot of time talking about supply chain in our remarks and on the q&a here. but, you know, i do want to be clear that what's the most important thing, i'm glad you really brought this point up about volume, is that the continued growing demand for flavor and the strong growth of our business that we're fueling with executing on our strategies, and with our passionate and engaged employees is the most important thing.
inflation is a reality and our pricing has caught up with it, we're seeing that coming through in the margin sale, you can see it, you know, see us keep caught up and take the actions that are necessary. and then comes supply chain, that's really kind of the third most important, i think, which is to eliminate the excess of costs and inefficiencies that have crept into the supply chain. so, i do want to keep that in perspective, that growth is still at the top of the heap.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
fair enough. thanks very much, guys.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
great, thank you. mccormick's alignment with consumer trends and the rising demand for flavor in combination, with the presence and reach for global portfolio and our strategic investments, provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth. we're disciplined in our focus on the right opportunities and investing in our business. we're continuing to drive further growth as we successfully execute on our long-term strategies actively respond to changing consumer behavior and capitalize on opportunities from a relative strength.
we continue to be well positioned for continued success and remain committed to driving long term value for our shareholders.

kasey jenkins
good morning. this is kasey jenkins, chief strategy officer and senior vice president, investor relations. thank you for joining today's fourth quarter earnings call. to accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.
with me this morning are lawrence kurzius, chairman and ceo; brendan foley, president and coo; and mike smith, executive vice president and cfo. during this call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. the nature of those financial measures and the related reconciliations to the gaap results are included in this morning's press release and slides. in our comments, certain percentages are rounded.
please refer to our presentation for complete information. today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. actual results could differ materially from those projected. the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or other factors.
please refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more information. i will now turn the discussion over to lawrence. 
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. our fourth quarter concluded a challenging and volatile year that impacted our ability to deliver on our expectations and our financial performance. at the same time, we ended the year with positive momentum with consumer consumption trends and flavor solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply, and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure.
and more work remains to be done. our confidence in our outlook for 2023 and beyond are strong. our organization is focused squarely on executing on the priorities i just mentioned, all of which are important drivers in the successful execution of our strategies and the delivery of stronger results. turning to slide 5, in our fourth quarter results, our sales declined 2% from the year-ago period, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency.
in constant currency, sales grew 2% within our implied fourth quarter guidance range but below our expectations. greater-than-expected covid-related disruptions in china unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both total the quarter and the consumer segment by approximately 2%. fourth quarter sales would have grown in the range of 4% with constant currency, excluding the impact of china on our results. we even anticipated even higher growth.
the fourth quarter restocking comparisons in the americas consumer segment further tempered our growth. as compared to last year, our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 2% reflected a 9% contribution from pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% decline in underlying volume and product mix, and expected 2% volume decline from the kitchen basics divestiture and the exits of low-margin business in india and the consumer business in russia, and a 1% year-over-year volume decline from the china-covid related disruption. despite the tempered fourth quarter sales performance, our underlying sales strength positions us well to accelerate sales growth in 2023. in our consumer segment, excluding china, consumption trends strengthened, particularly in the u.s.
for our fourth quarter, total branded consumption grew 6%. in our flavor solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding, continued momentum across all regions. consumers increasing demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers' product, and those reflected in this performance and in our most recent proprietary consumer insights research, our alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating, and valuing trusted brands continues to deliver results. this alignment, combined with our broad and advantage portfolio plus the fundamental strength of our categories, continues to underscore the products' positioning for long-term differentiated growth in flavor.
moving to profit, our adjusted operating income declined 10%, or 9% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share decline of 13% fell short of our expectations. let me spend a moment on the differences to our expectation. unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our consumer segment. this was primarily due to lower u.s.
spice and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022, which i'll discuss in a moment. our results also reflected lower-than-anticipated sales in china and an unfavorable product mix related to the sales mix between segments. in addition, with two covid-related plant shutdowns in china, we realized lower operating leverage. during the quarter, we made meaningful progress to lower our run rate costs and flavor solutions with the reduction of elevated costs that we've been incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business.
the impact of that progress was offset in the fourth quarter by unexpected, discrete one-time issues. however, we expect to see positive benefits in our results going forward. turning to slide 7, we're committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. in our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies, while also strengthening our ability to service customers.
to that end, we have targeted the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs over the next two years. we are also taking streamlining actions across our entire organization, targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings. the combination of these actions, which is our global operating effectiveness program, is incremental to our comprehensive continuous improvement, or cci savings. our cci program has a well-established track record of success, and we're leveraging its proven program discipline to drive results.
we expect our global operating effectiveness program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize 75 million through the p&l in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. we can see the results coming through, and we expect the impact to scale up as the year progresses. now, let me share more details on our actions. during last year, we transitioned to our global operating model, allowing us to more effectively leverage our scale and drive cost reductions.
as we further advanced that model and streamline our processes, strengthen our collaboration, and align our structure to work more efficiently, we are taking corresponding action to streamline our workforce across the entire organization. we're making considerable progress on the streamlining actions we have underway. a large component of our streamlining actions is a u.s. voluntary retirement program, which is very far along, with a targeted separation date of february 1st.
this will be followed by other actions, some of which will be involuntary. as always, we will care for our employees in keeping with our shared values. moving to the supply chain, our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. and while we expect continued volatility in global supply chain, we have strengthened our resiliency over the past few years to achieve this priority.
as we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we incurred additional costs above inflation to service our customers and are seeing inefficiencies develop in our supply chain. some of these costs for investments and decisions made to support continued growth for both our customers in mccormick, and some are the result of a buildup that can occur in periods of disruption. in 2022, with service levels as focus, the normalization of our supply chain costs and inventory levels have taken longer than expected. as we stated on our third quarter call, during the fourth quarter, we began to implement initiatives to optimize our cost structure, increase our capacity, and reduce inventory level of strengthening our supply chain resiliency and ability to service our customers.
now, for some details on these initiatives. first and foremost, while we continue to resolve some outliers, we have rebuilt and stabilized our service back to strong levels and at a high level of finished goods inventory on hand. operating from this position enables us to maximize our performance, reduce our labor costs, and pare back excessive use of co-packers within our operations. starting with labor, as we expected to be the most significant driver of our cost reductions, during the fourth quarter, we reinstated a more normal shift schedule, with most locations now operating on a 24/5 pattern.
this allows us to eliminate inefficient and unpopular, difficult-to-staff shifts. additionally, as we move away from the industrywide labor issues seen during the pandemic, we have stabilized absenteeism and turnover rates in our workforce and returned to more standard staffing by line. during the quarter, we optimized our leadership structure throughout our facilities and upgraded the talent in key roles. simultaneously, we're increasing the capability levels of our teams.
we're also accelerating automation, ranging from individual pieces of equipment, to a completely automated line for a high-volume packaging format. we expect through these initiatives to reduce 10% of our americas supply chain workforce. and over the past three months, we have already achieved half of the planned reduction. next, turning to our capacity, we're supporting future growth and enabling better customer service by investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in constrained areas.
these investments also enable the repatriation of the production we scaled up at co-packers while continuing to meet the elevated demand. in our flavor solutions segment, our flavors volume, including seasonings and flavor encapsulation, has been growing at a mid-single digit rate for each of the past three years, and demand remains strong. our investments in additional seasonings capacity, as well as spray-dried capacity, with the expansion of bonus footprint, are on track to be online during the second quarter. meanwhile, in our consumer segment, we've been using co-packers for targeted high-demand packaging formats, such as some of our large value-sized items.
now, given the efficiencies gained and the investments already in place, we've started to repatriate some of these formats. overall, we're on track for co-pack spending in 2023 to be the lowest in the past five years. from an inventory perspective, we're executing on initiatives to return to historical safety stock levels, which have been disrupted and raised by the supply chain issues of the last few years. we reduced both raw material and finished goods inventory during the fourth quarter.
while we're aware we have further progress to make, we're confident and encouraged by the results of our initiatives are delivering so far. as we progressed to a more normalized environment, we will realize additional benefits from these changes. for example, we expect to see reductions in expedited freight and less than truckload shipping costs, and will streamline other transportation inefficiencies. with the recent opening of our new maryland logistics center, we're able to eliminate expensive external warehouse costs before even fully realizing the inventory reductions, accelerating the expense savings.
with more efficient manufacturing and more inventory levels, we expect lower material loss. we have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years. i'm confident that our disciplined approach to resolving the increased costs within our supply chain while prioritizing meeting our customers' needs. the impact of our actions is expected to normalize our supply chain costs, enhance our efficiency and ability to meet demand, reduce inventory levels, and ultimately increase our profit realizations as reflected in our 2023 outlook.
our global operating effectiveness program has considerable momentum and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you after our first quarter of 2023. now, moving to fourth quarter business updates for each of our segments. turning to our consumer segment on slide 8, sales performance in the quarter was impacted by factors mentioned previously: the kitchen basics divestiture, exits of businesses, and covid-related disruptions in china, as well as trade inventory dynamics between years. these factors, as well as lapping high covid-related demand early in the year, also impacted the full year performance.
importantly, on a three-year basis, we have grown in annual sales at a 5% cagr driven by the americas region. we ended the year with positive momentum in our consumption trends. now, for some regional highlights on sales and consumption. starting with the americas, during the fourth quarter of 2021, because we were restocking, shipments were higher than consumption.
and we are lapping at this quarter, which impacts our sales growth. as we entered the holiday season this year and having shipped fairly in line with consumption for the first three quarters of the year, customers did not need to replenish their inventory as much despite strong consumer consumption during the holiday season. we estimate our fourth quarter sales growth rate was unfavorably impacted, 6% related to these restocking comparisons. we did not fully appreciate the level of fourth quarter restocking in 2021, especially of high-margin holiday herbs and spices and the resulting impact on our year-over-year growth and, as such, had expected stronger sales growth this year.
that said, excluding this impact, our underlying volume performance in the fourth quarter was better than in the second and third quarters. we have confidence that as we move out of the first quarter, the holiday season fluctuations this year between consumption and inventory levels, as well as retailer restocking resulting from pandemic-driven dynamics, will normalize. and we have an increased level of confidence in our visibility. our total u.s.
branded portfolio consumption growth of 6% this quarter, as indicated by our iri consumption data combined with unmeasured channel, was the strongest of the year. our investments in brand marketing and stronger holiday merchandising proved to be effective. and with the stabilization of supply disruptions, restoration of our service levels continued. and our fourth quarter service level was the best of the year, just shy of our pre-pandemic standards.
our consumption dollar sales unit and volume all accelerated sequentially, and our total distribution points, or tdp, have stabilized. spices and seasoning, our fourth quarter performance was the strongest of the year. consumers are responding to our value messaging, trading up to larger sizes and, according to our consumer insights, are learning to navigate the current environment. we're continuing to build distribution on the lawry's everyday spice range we launched last quarter, and earlier results are positive.
we are seeing incremental sales and profits of the category as consumers are trading up to supply for private label. in recipe mixes, we gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter. and with improved packaging supply, we also gain share in hot sauce and mustard during the quarter. across the portfolio, our trends are continuing to strengthen in the first quarter of 2023.
in emea, we ended the year with our strongest sales growth in the fourth quarter. our effective pricing and new product growth accelerated versus the first three quarters with our fourth quarter price realization the highest of the year and our volume declined the lowest. our strong consumption momentum continued and accelerated sequentially. in the fourth quarter and for the full year, we gained share versus last year and 2019 in the u.k.
and eastern europe herbs, spices, and seasoning. those gains were somewhat offset by softer performance in france. in the u.k., we're driving the hot sauce category with frank's redhot continuing to gain share again in the quarter and for the full year versus last year, as well as compared to 2019. additionally, in the u.k., we advanced our recipe mixes leadership during 2022 to the no.
1 share position. as we enter 2023, we're confident in our continued momentum in the emea region. in the asia-pacific region, growth for the quarter and year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in india, which will last after the first quarter of 2023, as well as the covid-related disruption in china. reflected in our outlook, we are expecting continued disruption into the first quarter of 2023 with an expected recovery after the chinese new year.
while we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in china. our brand marketing, new product, and category management initiatives are driving positive momentum with more to come in 2023. and we look forward to sharing this and our growth plans at cagny in a few weeks. turning to flavor solutions on slide 9, sales growth reflected pricing actions, as well as higher base volume growth in new products.
our sales performance has been outstanding all year by double-digit growth every quarter in the americas and the emea regions, resulting in 12% growth for the full year. on a three-year basis, we have grown annual sales at an 8% cagr with strong growth in all three regions. now, for some regional highlights. our americas fourth quarter sales growth was the strongest of the year.
growth in flavors, including snacks, seasonings, and flavors for performance nutrition and health and market applications, as well as branded food service products, drove our fourth quarter performance, as well as our strong broad-based growth for the year. we continue to realize the benefits from the combined capabilities of fona and mccormick, with new products contributing approximately 30% more growth in flavor in 2022 than last year. demand continues to strengthen with branded food service restaurant and institutional food service customers, and we're also expanding distribution and gaining share in both spices and seasonings, and hot sauce. in emea, our strong fourth quarter performance in all product categories capped an outstanding year of 17% growth, including significant volume growth of 9%, as well as pricing.
we are winning in all markets and channels. growth remains strong across our customer base, led by the momentum with our quick service restaurant, or qsr, customers, partially driven by expanded distribution and their promotional activities. in apz, we're driving further menu penetration with our qsr customers, realizing growth for strong performance of core menu items we flavor. we delivered solid growth in the apz region for the year despite the covid-related disruptions in china.
across markets outside of china, we drove double-digit growth with contributions from both volume and pricing. overall, flavor solutions demand has remained strong. and for certain parts of our business in the americas and emea regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand, driving extraordinary costs to service our customers. we appreciate our customers working with us and are encouraged by the results our collaboration is already beginning to yield.
our flavor solutions sales growth has been outstanding. we are not delivering profit growth in this segment. we are committed to restoring flavor solutions profitability, recovering margins while ensuring we keep our customers and supply. in driving growth for both mccormick and our customers, we are confident we will achieve margin recovery through three actions.
effective price realization. our price increases are only now catching up to the pace of inflation, and we're beginning to recover the cost inflation in our pricing lag last year. the successful execution of the global operating effectiveness program i just mentioned. in particular, we expect the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies and the investments in capacity to have a significant impact in the flavor solutions segment.
and finally, continued focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio. the strength of our flavor solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our customer engagement approach and culinary-inspired innovation, are driving our outstanding flavor solution momentum. we look forward to sharing more about our growth plans and margin recovery at cagny in a few weeks. now, some summary comments before turning it over to mike.
turning to slide 10, global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great, fast growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. we continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. these long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, but the younger generations deal with them at a greater rate. mccormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste.
with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we're delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. through our products and our customers' products and our driving growth, we are end-to-end flavor. we remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies, and values that have made us so successful. we have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility.
the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, gives us confidence in our growth and momentum and in our ability to navigate the dynamic global environment. as we look ahead to 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure, and positioning mccormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. the fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical financial performance remains strong, and we're confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023. i want to recognize mccormick's employees around the world for their contributions at 2022 and the momentum they are driving in 2023.
now, i'll turn it over to mike.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lawrence, and good morning, everyone. starting on slide 13, our top-line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. this growth was tempered by a 1% unfavorable impact from the kitchen basics divestiture, a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in india and the consumer business in russia, and a 1% impact from china consumption disruption related to covid restrictions. in our consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 4% with the divestiture of kitchen basics contributing 1% to the decline and the combined impact of exiting the businesses in india and russia, as well as the china consumption disruption contributing 3% to the decline.
on slide 14, consumer sales in the americas declined 4% in constant currency. pricing actions in the region were more than offset by volume decline, including a 2% impact from the kitchen basics divestiture, as well as a 6% impact from lapping the restocking of retail inventory in the fourth quarter of last year and higher level of retail inventories entering this year's holiday season. additionally, returning to pre-pandemic promotional levels also tempered our sales comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. in emea, constant currency consumer sales grew 2%.
pricing actions across all markets were partially offset by lower volume of product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in russia. constant currency consumer sales in the asia-pacific region declined 22%, including a 23% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in china, as well as the exit of low margin business in india. pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. turning to our flavor solutions segment in slide 17, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 14%, primarily due to pricing actions, with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth in all regions.
in the americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales grew 13% with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. higher sales of packaged food and beverage companies with strength of snack seasonings led the growth. higher demand from branded food service customers also contributed to growth. in emea, we drove 16% constant currency sales growth, with 10% related to pricing actions and 6% behind the mix.
the emea flavor solutions growth was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth in qsr and packaged food and beverage company customers. in the asia-pacific region, flavor solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. growth was driven by higher sales in qsr customers, driven by strength in our core menu items. as seen on slide 21, adjusted gross margin declined 410 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period.
i'll spend a moment on the significant drivers, highlighting the ones that drove more compression than we had expected. first, approximately 60% of this decline, or 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. next, product mix was unfavorable as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as well as compared to our expectations for the quarter. first, in our consumer segment, as mentioned earlier, lower u.s.
spices and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons of 2021 and 2022, as well as lower sales of higher-margin products in china due to the covid restrictions, negatively impacted the mix. the sales shift between our consumer and flavor solutions segment also contributed to the unfavorable product mix as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. the impact of the unfavorable product mix was higher than we expected due to the shortfall in consumer sales from what we anticipated, driven by both lower u.s. and china sales.
now, for the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins. in our consumer segment, we experienced lower operating leverage because of the sales comparisons already discussed. the impact, though, was greater than expected due to the china covid-related plant shutdowns. in our flavor solutions segment, as we transition production to our new u.k.
peterborough manufacturing facility, we continue to incur dual-running costs. we expect the unfavorable year-over-year impact of these costs to continue in the first quarter of 2023 and then, for the balance of the year, expect it to be comparable to 2022. additionally, we are still incurring elevated costs to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. while painful short term, we know these investments to support our customers during periods of disruption are the right approach to drive long-term growth.
that said, we did make progress on reducing the level of these costs in the fourth quarter. however, the impact of that progress is offset by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates and some discrete issues we experienced in our flavor solutions operations during the quarter. while we recover quickly from these issues, they still contributed significant unexpected costs to the quarter. finally, partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers i just mentioned were our cci-led cost savings.
and of note, our price increases continue to catch up with cost inflation during the quarter for both segments. this was in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance. in 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation our pricing has lagged over the last two years. now, moving to slide 22, selling, general, and administration expenses, or sg&a, declined from the fourth quarter of last year, with lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution cost and brand marketing investments.
as a percentage of net sales, sg&a declined 270 basis points. the net impact of the factors i just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. in constant currency, the consumer segment's adjusted operating income declined 5%. and in the flavor solutions segment, it declined 26%.
turning to interest expense and income taxes on slide 23, our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as over our third quarter of this year, both driven by the higher rate environment. our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.3% in the year-ago period. both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. at the bottom line, as shown on slide 24, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 for the year-ago period.
the decrease was driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with higher interest expense and a higher fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate also contributing to the decrease. on slide 25, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. our cash flow from operations for the year was $652 million, which is lower than the same period last year. this decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels.
we returned $397 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and use $262 million for capital expenditures in 2022. our capital expenditures include growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. in 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to 2022 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. we expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow, driven by our profit and working capital initiatives.
our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends, and paying down debt. we remain committed to a strong investment grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. with improving our gross margin through our plan to normalize our supply chain costs and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt and expect to de-lever to approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2024. now, turning to our 2023 financial outlook on slide 26.
our 2023 outlook reflects our positive top-line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. we expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance, as well as a net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. we expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset, below operating profit, by significantly higher interest expense and a higher-projected effective tax rate. we also expect there will be minimal impact from currency rates.
at the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the ramp of last year's pricing actions, combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. we expect several factors to impact our volume of product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which we expect to be consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced but in line with the current environment; a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of covid-related disruptions in china, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter to quarter given 2022 level of demand volatility; the divestiture of our kitchen basics business in august of last year; and the exit of our consumer business in russia during last year's second quarter; and finally, the continual pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. as always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022.
this adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our cci-led and global operating effectiveness programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low- to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. we expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged last year. moving to adjusted operating income, first, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. first, the cost savings from our global operating effectiveness program are expected to have an 800 basis-point impact.
the savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. next, the benefit of lapping the impact of covid-related disruptions in china is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. the kitchen basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis-point impact. and finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation.
the net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. this favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, resulted in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. in addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts i just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our cci-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million. based on the anticipated timing of certain items, we expect our adjusted operating profit growth to be pressured in the first quarter, accelerating in the second quarter, and return to normalized cadence of delivery for the remainder of the year.
the impact of cost inflation will be weighted toward the first half of 2023 with peak inflation in the first quarter. also, in the first quarter, we expect continued pressure to sales and profit from covid-related disruptions in china and then the benefit beginning of the second quarter from lapping last year's impact. additionally, the exit of our consumer business in russia will impact the first quarter. as a reminder, we began exiting it during the second quarter of last year.
finally, related to profit timing, while we expect a minimal impact from currency rates, we projected unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and expect a 3% unfavorable in the first quarter and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. we are anticipating a meaningful step up in interest expense, driven by the higher interest rate environment which will impact our floating debt. we estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, spread evenly throughout the year. as a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023.
the net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an 800 basis-point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings-per-share growth. for 2023, adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based on our estimated mix of earnings by geography, as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis-point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. we expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half.
to summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10%, a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items i just mentioned impacting profit: the global operating effectiveness program, the china recovery, the kitchen basics divestiture, and the incentive compensation rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. this results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. we are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top-line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure, and strong adjusted operating profit growth, as well as margin expansion. while this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business, and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. now, i'd like to share our financial results and outlook in more detail. i would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 28. our fourth quarter sales performance, despite challenges from the covid-related disruptions in china, reflects the underlying strength of our global portfolio and the continued execution of our long-term strategies.
with the stabilization of service and our supply chain, in addition to positive momentum and consumption growth, we expect an acceleration in consumer segment sales dollars and volume in 2023 and continued strong flavor solutions performance as the strength of our portfolio is met with outstanding demand across our customer base. we have strong growth programs, and we look forward to sharing them at cagny. we are committed to increasing our profit realization. the actions we have underway to normalize our supply chain costs and increase our organizational effectiveness and efficiency are already yielding results.
our global operating effectiveness program is expected to deliver $125 million in cost savings. we expect the benefits of the program to scale up through each quarter of 2023 and continue to be accretive into 2024. while actively responding to the macroeconomic challenges we're facing, we continue to operate with the same discipline and commitment to execution, as we have in any other operating environment. the fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers, and shareholders in both 2023 and beyond.
the compelling benefit of our relentless focus on improved performance and people continues to position mccormick to drive sales growth. this, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. before turning to your questions, i want to reiterate my confidence in driving the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 outlook. and now, for your question.

[operator instructions] our first question is from the line of andrew lazar with barclays. please proceed with your questions.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, everybody.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, andrew.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi there. i guess the question i'm getting, i think, most from investors this morning really has to do with the fiscal '23 operating profit guidance of 9% to 11%. i understand you've got incremental cost savings that are set to offset the incentive comp rebuild. and you have some of the china recovery built in as well.
but i guess in what's still clearly a dynamic operating environment, it still seems, i guess, aggressive to a bunch of folks we've spoken to this morning, especially given it's expected to be a somewhat backend-loaded year from a profitability standpoint. so, i was hoping, lawrence, maybe you could comment a bit on that and add some more color on the level of confidence around this. and then, i've just got a follow-up. thank you.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. this almost comes up on my final comments in the prepared remarks. we really believe that this is balanced guidance. it is certainly not aggressive.
we have a degree of humility after last year and have a balanced outlook considering risks. and we have a high degree of confidence in this guidance, including the operating profit guidance. you know, it's underscored by our strong consumer demand. you know, the underlying demand from the consumer is quite strong coming out of fourth quarter.
it's actually the strongest consumer demand that we've seen. and we continue to have tremendous demand from our flavor solutions customer. we have very strong programs that we did not talk about on this call, particularly on herbs and spices. and we'll be sharing those growth programs at cagny.
so, that is a foundation underlying the performance on operating profit. we have very strong confidence in our ability to realize the cost savings that we've described. these programs are being managed programmatically through the same team that manages our cci program, and i believe that they are very much in our control and quite confident about them. and i think that they more than offset the build of incentive comp.
and maybe what some of the people are talking about and haven't fully considered is that we expect to cover not only this year's cost inflation, but also recover all of the costs that we have lagged over the last two years and our pricing actions early in the year. as you know, pricing actions take time to settle in, so you would be correct in assuming that many of these conversations are either completed or well underway at this time.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. no, that's helpful. and that's a good segue into my follow-up, which is, you know, with low- to mid-teens inflation still to come and as you've talked about, likely further pricing action still ahead, i'm just trying to get a sense how that jives with, you know, the price gap issue that you've talked about previously in your core spice and seasonings category, and the fact that pricing decelerated sequentially in fiscal 4q in consumer versus 3q. and i thought it was supposed to build, and maybe that was mix versus --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to say a couple of words about that. i'm going to let brendan follow me. first of all, on that pricing, i would not forget that the significant portion of it is going to be on the flavor solutions side of the business. you know, so contract windows have allowed us to make some moves there.
and so that is certainly a big part of the pricing equation. our inflation outlook is higher actually on the flavor solutions inputs than on consumer inputs for the year. so, the pricing is similarly skewed more toward the flavor solutions side of it. i'm going to let brendan talk about the price gaps and take it from here, please.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. andrew, just to build in lawrence's reply, and i'll just jump right to maybe i think one of the points you brought up regarding, you know, private label. you know, we are seeing price gaps narrow right now, and we certainly saw that in the fourth quarter, even leading into the first quarter. and you start to see that trade-down moderate, obviously, through the quarter.
so, you know, that's kind of an insight. and maybe that's also a reaction to sort of the macro, you know, inflationary factors have seen the moderate also, you know, out there in the economy overall. you know, consumers are looking for brands, but they're also looking for value. and so, it's not necessarily the lowest-priced parts of our portfolio.
we're seeing really start to drive a lot of growth just on large sizes, as we're seeing consumers kind of look for that value. we also, you know, you should also have called out, launched the lawry's everyday line of spices, and we're starting to continue to build distribution on this. but the early results are really good, maybe better than what we expected. you know, we're seeing a lot of incremental category sales and profit coming from this line item mostly because consumers are trading up from private label.
that's kind of the source of volume that we're seeing coming from this. and it's bringing in new consumers into the mccormick portfolio. so, we like the results so far that this is providing. but, you know, that's certainly a good outcome.
and it factors into how we think about, you know, next year. on pricing, just sort of, you know, comparing quarter to quarter, you know, to your point, i think it's probably more a function of the fact that we've been reinstating promotional activity that's been, i think, called out previously. we're also lapping last year's increases which were higher, you know, on a relative basis. but also, our volume miss in the fourth quarter had an impact on that overall level of pricing, too.
so, you know, we've covered that with regard to the restocking comparison. and that's factored into that quarter to quarter view.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thanks so much, and see you guys in florida.

our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with jpmorgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good morning.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ken.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wasn't sure if i heard you correctly. and maybe you said this, maybe you didn't.
but you said that sales growth will be driven primarily by pricing. does this mean you expect volumes for the year in '23 to be positive? and i guess along those lines, i think you mentioned that you expect elasticity to not necessarily worsen in '23 versus '22. i think, if i heard you right, you said it will remain kind of at today's level. just curious why that is, given that the consumer environment, you know, does seem to be eroding a small amount?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to start with the last part of it, ken. you know, we've seen some moderation of elasticity as we've gone through the year. it looks like peak elasticity was around the time when gas prices were at $5 a gallon and above for most of the country. and that was really not so much a reaction to our price increase but to the general level of inflation that consumers were experiencing and the high pressure on their wallets.
so, you know, our outlook for 2023 assumes that, you know, a similar environment carries forward and that we're seeing elasticity in that range. we've also adjusted, you know, and we've looked at -- you know, we've seen where we've had a greater elasticity and where we've had lesser elasticity, and we've reflected that in our, you know, our future pricing actions. so, you know, i think that we've really been thoughtful around the question of elasticity. we do expect the consumer to be under pressure in 2023.
i don't care whether you call it a recession or a soft landing. you know, consumers on the lower end of the income spectrum, not even -- i'm not talking about the bottom, i'm talking about the lower half. you know, they're going to have less money and are going to be careful, you know, with their budgets. we are reflecting that in our marketing programs already.
but some of the innovation that we that we've launched, you know, not all about buying the cheapest product. consumers are looking for value, and that's really come through clear in our proprietary research, you know, value and has many components. it is true that our sales growth is driven primarily by pricing in 2023. and at the total company level, we expect volume to be pretty much flat.
and so, that would be an improvement in the trend line, but that's going to vary tremendously by region. and kind of the good bit of the overall volume growth is going to come from a recovery in china following, you know, this -- what we expect following this quarter where we have that tremendous, you know, covid impact right now during chinese new year. guys, did i miss anything there?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think it's clear.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
just a quick follow-up, and thank you for that, on the restocking, you mentioned that perhaps you hadn't quite recognized at the time how large the impact was the last couple of years. totally understandable, given the volatility that everyone's going through. i'm just curious if the company's doing anything to maybe, you know, slightly improve its ability to quantify those dynamics maybe in a more real-time way. so, you know, going forward, there's just fewer surprises from your end?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's a great question, ken. i'm going to pass that straight to brendan. 
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, ken, for the question. you know, definitely, you know, this environment, you know, certainly volatile, you know, made it tougher to read. but as we think about just looking forward, it is definitely, you know, going through, i think, this period of time has allowed us to kind of refine how we look at your restocking and, you know, just the fluctuations particularly coming out of the season, you know, between consumption and shipments.
this has allowed us, i think, to kind of refine our view. you know, overall, we definitely had a pretty disciplined approach to this even prior to the pandemic. but i think this is refined how we look at it in the tools that we use, the analytics that we apply. so, we have a lot of confidence going into this next year, particularly as we exit the first quarter, that just the fluctuations that we typically would see during holiday season between consumption and shipments, and then, on top of that, this restocking comparison.
things begin to normalize, i think, is our view as we come out of q1, providing just a little bit more stability in that read.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
some of that is internal to me. our supply chain is really operating at a much higher level now than it has --
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
investment service perspective and stability. that's another thing that gives us better insight into our sales.

our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your questions.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. i was hoping to break down the --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, rob.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. i was hoping to break down your volume forecast by consumer versus labor solutions. because, you know, i think one of the strange dynamics in 2022 is that at a time when consumers are trying to save money, volumes were weak in consumer. but your bottom line is pretty strong in flavor solutions.
so, i'm wondering how you think of '23. and is there a risk that because the consumer environment is so volatile that it might be very tough to determine what the trade-down between like food service and retail might be?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't think that we're giving a -- providing a split between the growth rates on consumer and the flavored solutions. i will say that you would expect higher growth on flavor solutions in '23. you know, we have, you know, if nothing else, a higher level of pricing expected in the flavor solutions segment. and that alone is going to drive a higher increase year on year.
you know, flavor solutions is a bit of a portfolio itself that includes your branded food service, where we believe we have gained significant share in north america, in particular, in our branded food service business with the number of wins as we've gone through the year. we've had tremendous growth on flavors and flavor seasonings for flavor solutions customers, you know, in the area of snacks, performance and nutrition, of the health end market. you know, we've had, you know, very strong unit growth, you know, through the entire pandemic and continuing through '22. and we see no end in sight on that.
we have been slightly capacity constrained in that area, and we have some significant new capacity, you know, the longer-term investments that are kind of coming online in the second quarter, you know, that opens up additional capacity for us that's both for flavor with some expansion that we've done at fona for spray-drying capability and in snack seasonings, where we've been in the process of converting one of our plants from some low-margin products and the ability to run snack seasonings and that, you know, conversion is effectively coming online. we're in the trial stages right now and should be online in the second quarter. so, it's a bit of a long-ish answer there, but i hope that covered it.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and as a follow-up, you talked about the new plant that's opening in the u.k. and the double costs, i guess, that are involved in it. why is it taking so long to get past these double costs?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, rob, it's mike. i'll answer that. i mean, i'd say this. i mean, we're taking -- we have a very large, actually, footprint in one part of the u.k.
and, you know, the peterborough plant, which we've talked about, is a massive facility. so, we're kind of doing this in a two-step process to make sure we service our customers properly. so, you know, it's different than when you're just building new capacity, like we've talked about, where you're kind of adding on to a plant. we're actually closing a plant in a very difficult environment to close plants for a lot of reasons, moving it to a brand new facility.
so, that does take more time. the good news is we're kind of almost out of that after the first quarter. you think about the incremental costs we've talked about is in the first quarter after that levels out. and as that production -- you know, remaining production transfers over the rest of this year, '24 will be a really clean year.
but when you're closing big plants and opening a big plant, those don't take one quarter. you know, it will take about a year if you think about it. that's what -- you know, this one is taking around that much time.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

our next question is from the line of alexia howard with bernstein. please proceed with your questions.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, alexia.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi there. can i focus in on the flavor solutions business. you gave us the three reasons why margins should improve this year. i'm kind of curious about timing on that, how quickly will the pricing kick in and the elimination of the capacity expansion costs.
just a little bit on the timing. thank you. and i have a follow-up.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i wasn't really being specific on the dual-running costs when i was describing the improvement in flavor solutions. you know, in terms of the pricing, you know, i don't want to get overly specific on this because, you know, we are in customer conversations right now. and there's a certain amount of commercial tension in all of those conversations.
but, you know, we fully expect, as i've said, about pricing generally, that on the flavor solution side of the business as well, that we will recover all of the inflation that we are not only incurring in the new year but also the cumulative inflation that we've collected -- that we've experienced in the last two. and i would say that our lag in getting caught up is greater in flavor solutions than it has been on the consumer side. so, it's going to be -- it's pretty meaningful. and that's an important element.
we fully expect, you know, to have that complete early in the year.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think the other point, too, alexia, a couple of things. we talked about inflation being weighted to the front of the year. that first quarter is the highest inflation that impacts flavor solutions, as well as consumer. the other thing is our global operating effectiveness program.
i mean, there's been a lot of positive activity. the reality, though, is the first quarter's going to have the least impact, and it's going to wrap up really rapidly in the second, third, and fourth quarter. so, you know, the second quarter is going to be a big impact --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
skewed to the --
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
skewed to flavor solutions because a lot of the inefficiencies we've talked about in the last year have been in the pricing area for flavor solutions. so, we do see a bit more of that savings going to that segment, which will help.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. and then, as a follow-up, the share -- i hate to come back to it, but the share dynamics in the u.s. herbs and spices that we're seeing in the nielsen data, it looks as though you're still losing market share. it doesn't look like it's private label anymore.
i presume it's more brands. when do you expect that to turn the corner? and can you give us any more color about what the dynamics are there? thank you, and i'll pass it on.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
alexia, i would love to answer that question, but i'm going to let brendan answer it. 
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, lawrence. alexia, just, you know, as we look at our business, i think, you know, just first remarking on the fourth quarter, i think what we feel pretty good about in terms of momentum we've talked about before is that we've seen sequential improvement not only across total mccormick portfolio in consumer in the u.s. but also in herbs and spices. fourth quarter is probably our best quarter of the year.
we saw sequential improvement on not only sales but also unit and also volume as we went through the second quarter all the way to the fourth quarter. so, that's pretty good momentum going into the next year. having said that, certainly, you know, we saw stabilization of where our share is right now and expect to improve that over the course of '22. but we don't ever really get into the habit of sort of projecting what share will be in the future, so we're not going to do that on this call necessarily.
but we do expect to have improved performance in '23. and i think, you know, related to what those plans will be, we'll talk a lot more about that in cagny. and so, i think, you know, there'll be a lot of great opportunity to kind of go deeper on what those plans and opportunities look like.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
we actually would have loved to have done that on this call, and kasey just insisted that we save some firepower for cagny. i know your question, alexia, was about u.s. herbs and spices specifically, but if i could just step back. you know, if i look at the fourth quarter, we gained share in hot sauce.
we gained substantial share in mustard where we finally are back in full supply. you know, we got our, i think, our fifth consecutive quarters in a row of strong share growth in recipe mixes, which, you know, and everyone forgets those, but their profitability is right there with herbs and spices. and then, in many of our international markets, you know, we had share gains in urban spices specifically. so, you know, when you look at the full picture, you know, we've got generally, as has been the case at lawry's, had good supply.
we have had the, you know, ability to grow our market share. a lot of the share loss that you're seeing is due to ptp losses early in the year that are still being lapped. and i expect -- you know, we have won some of those ptps back, and i expect us to continue to do so as we go through '23.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst

our next question is from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. good morning, everyone.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. hi. so, i wanted to maybe hone in a little bit on the kind of net operating income growth guidance and where you shake out for 2023 because i'm just trying to square the thought relative to where profit was in 2020 and 2021. especially '21, you're still at the high end of the guidance range, 80 million, 90 million lower than you were last year, which there shouldn't be an incentive comp kind of comparison issue in there.
and you talk about fully recovering pricing cost inflation. currency has been a little bit of a headwind, divestiture is kind of net debt sold a few things, and volumes are lower. but i guess i'm just trying to reconcile kind of where, on an absolute dollar basis, we shake out for 2023, inclusive of the incremental restructuring and the cumulative effect of pricing relative to where the profit dollars were two years ago, three years ago, and how we think we should think about that at the company level moving forward. i mean, are we rebased somewhat through as we've come through covid? or is there an acceleration beyond 2024 and for 2023 in profit growth to kind of get the long term kind of either cagr back into that kind of mid to high single-digit range?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, this is mike. good question. i mean, we put together that slide in the earnings deck to really walk you from the current guidance and a from a percentage basis, realizing it's not dollars, but from a percentage basis, constant currency guidance to the underlying base growth. and if you think about it, you know, you look at that underlying base growth.
once you take out all the kind of, i'm going to hate to say, one timers, but things that are really discrete items year over year, and some of which will continue into next year, you know, like the global operating effectiveness program as you talked about, rebuilding our profit out -- getting back to our long-term profit algorithm by taking out these costs that have really come through during the pandemic. so, i think there is a case for acceleration in the future. we're not talking about '24 or '25 right now. we need to nail '23.
so, if you look at that underlying base growth, you know, 4% to 6% net sales growth, which actually went out bolt-on m&a at the high end of our guidance. so, you know, really good underlying performance. you know, we get back to the 7% to 9% operating profit growth. really, if you think about the recovery of the pricing that we talked about that allows us to really drive that 3 percentage point increase, we get to that 7% to 9%, so we feel good about that, along with our normal things like our normal cci program and things like that, investing a bit more in advertising to grow the brand, so that virtuous cycle we talk about to get the operating profit.
and, you know, 1% leverage below there. you know, we'd love to pay out more debt that's why we're driving hard on our working capital programs this year to get our inventories back down to where they need to be. so, we feel good about -- you know, like lawrence said before, it's a prudent call. you know, we feel really confident about it.
so i think -- hopefully, that helps you understand the moving parts other than discrete items. some of which, the positives will continue into next year, even the net recovery in china, hopefully '24 is better than '23. but we feel good about the underlying base growth.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, i will add to that, you know, the guidance that we're giving is balanced, and i'll even say, you know, prudent. and that's our opinion. and you've heard from some of the other questions that there are some who think that this actually might even be aggressive. but we've tried to give balanced guidance here.
but our teams are used to winning and have very aggressive business plans. and we'll do everything we can to not just recover but exceed. we're used to starting every year-end earnings call with the phrase, record results. we are not able to do that this year, and we would like to get back on track with the record of historic performance.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i appreciate all that color. if i can ask a follow-up on flavor solutions. and it just -- i mean, there's a meaningful portion of that business that selling into other food companies.
and just want to get a sense if you saw of experience or worried about any destocking among some of your food company customers, who either have taken similar working capital kind of reduction actions as you are taking yourselves or are kind of have counseled to think about that potential moving forward in the context of a still fairly sluggish underlying consumption.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say at this point, the fact is that our supply chain recovery, i believe, and the feedback we get from our customers is generally ahead of the peers. and so, many of them are still fairly hit in the balance right now and different dynamics. you know, many of them are still rebuilding the inventories in the store or the shelf and getting items reinstated. and those in the area of snacking are just experiencing explosive growth.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
if i could build on that, lawrence. adam, the other thing to consider regarding our flavor solutions business as part of that sales growth algorithm is a lot of new product and innovation activity for our customers, as well as winning new customers, winning share in the market. and so, that factors into how we think about our growth.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. it's all helpful. i'll pass it on.

the next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel. please proceed with your questions.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i had a question coming back to kind of the u.s. business overall, and brendan had talked about kind of moderating a trade-down in the u.s. and i want to understand, do you attribute that to your promotional spending? was that one of the factors that helped drive that? and would you expect promotional spending to be up in fiscal '23? so, i'm trying to square that with the need for more pricing. and can you accomplish the price points you need, you know, and also see the kind of the value that seems that consumers are seeking there?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i will say that, you know, the promotional activity isn't all about discounting. and so, you know, a lot of the promotional activity that we've been able to reinstate is around merchandising activity, which, you know, puts displays and digital partnerships. and all --and these things have, you know, very good roi, and we are quite positive about them. i'm going to give the floor here to brendan now.
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. i mean, chris, i think as we go into '23 and how we look at it, just to build off of where lawrence is going, a lot of that, you know, promotional spending is getting back into driving the categories with our customers. and the feedback we're getting from them is welcome, frankly, in that regard because, you know, we want to keep, you know, driving a better overall growth. can you just remind me? the front end of your question, though, was in regards to what?
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
just that there -- you've seen a moderating in trade-down and you've had an increase in promotional spending. so, i was trying to understand. is that driving that moderating in trade-down? and then, can you accomplish that if you're trying to get prices higher?
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
i think you're seeing a confluence of a number of things happening in the quarter where some of those macro factors that we may have spoken about before, like the price of gas, etc., those things have moderated. so, therefore broadly, we think that has an impact. but also, the reinstatement of promotions probably, you know, during, obviously, a very important season like the holiday would have also a year-over-year impact there, too. but i think there's a couple of things we'd like to add is we got more aggressive in q4 for a reason.
we called that out in the third quarter. and part of that include also a lot of focus and increased a&p around value messaging. and we've seen a lot of great response from that. and so, i think there's a number of things playing in here, chris, that lead us to believe that we've got good momentum going into '23.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll also say that our proprietary consumer survey shows that, you know, between may and december, when we asked consumers about their mechanisms for coping with higher pricing, trading down to private label and store brands was the item that had the biggest decline in terms of consumers who said they were doing that. and so, i think that matches up well with what we're seeing through the scanner and in our other data.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good. that's helpful. thanks for all the color there. just one other quick follow-on or question would be that, you know, inventory was kind of a moving factor year over year, and you had a bigger -- a big increase last year in inventory.
did you build less inventory, i guess, overall? or should i say that maybe better that, did inventory move lower in the fourth quarter than you expected? is that the unique factor around the inventory move in the quarter?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we did start making progress on our inventory in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, both in the raw material and finished goods side, which was really a focus with our global operating efficiency program. one of the outputs of that is a reduced inventory, too, as you stabilize your supply chain. and we have very, very aggressive targets for this year. and again, it goes back to creating more cash to help drive our debt down.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
how about at retail?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
progress is just starting --
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
how about at retail as well, like, did retail inventories move lower in the fourth quarter?
brendan foley -- president and chief operating officer
no, chris. i would say that's not really, you know, the relationship we are trying to describe here. we feel like inventories simply retailers had done a lot of restocking in the fourth quarter of '21. and they just happen to have more on hand as we are going to the holiday season.
but i don't believe we are trying to say that they are executing the holiday season differently than they have, you know, as normal.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. and just in the normal ebb and flow of things. remember, you know, our fiscal year end stands in the middle of the holiday season.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
right. right.
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, coming in the first quarter, you know, retailer inventories are always high. we always ship below consumption in the first quarter. that's like a normal seasonal pattern. and i think that we are well set up for that.
just given the rapid amount of change, we are just being cautious about that. and in our remarks, we have said, you know, we expect normalization after q1.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. that makes sense. thanks so much for that color.

lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, and welcome.
max gumport -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
on the call, you gave some helpful -- hey, thanks. on the call, you gave some helpful details on the puts and takes to consider with regard to the cadence of your eps in fy '23. if i have it right, it sounds like the first quarter will be pressured as a result of peak inflation, cost savings ramping up throughout the year, a continued impact from covid-related disruptions in china, and a higher tax rate among other impacts. can you help give us a sense for how dramatically these factors could hold back your first quarter eps?
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean i think on top of that, the highest commodity cost increases in the first quarter. you know, i think -- you know, the first quarter is always our smallest quarter. if you think about the cadence of, max, in our history, fourth quarter are the most sales and most profit comes through because of the holiday season.
except for china, which is actually inversed. china's first quarter is their biggest quarter because of the chinese new year. so, that's another factor that's going to put pressure on our first quarter this year because of the covid issues. but i would hesitate to say, you know, we get round number is what it's going to be, but it's going to be a difficult first quarter.
for all the factors, you named four or five of the factors right on our list. i added the china impact also into that so -- as well as fx is -- you know, fx is flat for the year, max. but in the first quarter, it's about a 3% negative year on year. so, that's another reason that the first quarter is going to be the most challenging, but for all the reasons you mentioned with the global operating effectiveness, the recoveries, you know, it will be strong for the rest of the year.

thank you. our final question today comes from the line of peter galbo with bank of america. please proceed with your questions.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the question. i will keep it pretty quick.
i guess just as i think about the operating income bridge, you know, the incentive comp piece of that, that's kind of an 800 basis-point headwind, as you rebuild, you know, that function, you know, like, how flexible is that? or how discretionary is that? and the reason for the question is, let's say, you know, if something in the plan that you have, the year goes wrong outside of your factors, right, china take longer to reopen, or destocking take longer, or restock gets stronger in the u.s., like, can you pull that piece of the puzzle back more as a means to kind of still hit the operating income target? or is that pretty much, you know, you have to -- you're committed to spending that at this point?
lawrence kurzius -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, peter, you know, our incentive comp pays for growth. and we fell short of growth in 2022. and so, that's reflected in a very low incentive comp that we didn't take back and confidence to the p&l. as we went through 2022, in 2023, it starts a new year.
and so, we are starting with the expectation that we are going to hit our goals. and of course, you know, as we over or underachieve, we will adjust incentive comp as we go through the year.
mike smith -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it's very formulaic. the majority of our incentive competence based on mccormick profit, which is basically our operating profit less a capital charge we call kind of light eva model to make sure all of us are held accountable for capital improvement. so, it's really focused a lot on operating profit and a bit on eps, too, but very formulaic. we pay for growth.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
