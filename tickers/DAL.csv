certainly. [operator instructions] and we'll go first to savi syth with raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i'm just kind of curious after the -- kind of the vaccine news. you know, that have you seen a change in booking behavior? and -- and also, i know the, you know, testing requirement is probably positive longer term for opening up international demand, but are you seeing, you know, travelers perhaps shifting from more -- to more the -- domestic sun and sand destinations from international?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
savi, we -- the vaccine deployment still is very early and we haven't really seen -- seen much in the -- in the form of changed behaviors. we hear a lot anecdotally, but, you know, it's also one of the weakest travel periods of the year in the -- in the current month that we're in. we've not seen the booking curve start to expand. we -- we certainly hope to see that as we -- we get through the quarter and vaccines continue to become more prevalent.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
makes sense. and i -- i'd be curious just to follow up on -- on some of the kind of the changing dynamics here. i was wondering if you have any kind of preliminary thoughts on how maybe the american and jetblue partnership might impact kind of the northeast position.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we're -- we're not going to comment on the -- on our competitors or speculate. you know, we -- you know us well. you know we love competition and i think competition makes you better.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
next, we'll go to jamie baker of j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. first question for glen, sort of a follow-up, i suppose, on savi's question. in normal times, what percentage of international revenue is made up of trips that last fewer than four or five days? you know, i'm asking because, you know, i would think a trip of that duration would be particularly jeopardized by the need to land and almost immediately take a covid test so that you could come home?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, you know, i -- i think that's dependent on how far customers are traveling. generally, the longer they travel, the longer the stay is. so, i think what we are seeing is a very good response from the [inaudible], caribbean, and mexico resorts where hotels are now going to be offering that as part of the package. and so, while there may be some choppiness as there has been through this whole environment as we start adopting those testing procedures, we think in a pretty short order here that customers will adapt.
and to the extent that travel does shift from short-haul international back to domestic, we'll be ready to move the airplanes back too.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and, jamie, i'd like to add to glen's comments. you know, we -- we're still working obviously with the cdc. we endorse and support the testing requirements they've put in place. but a -- a new feature is the inclusion of rapid testing into the mix.
so, it doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be a pcr test. and with -- with the -- the growth of antigen testing, the quality of antigen testing that's out there, and the supplies in place, you literally could get these -- some of these tests done within a 10-minute interval, you know, shortly before you return.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
excellent. thank you for that, gentlemen. and a question for gary. how are you thinking about the optimal level of liquidity to carry in the future, you know, sort of a post-pandemic question.
and -- and if you haven't reached that conclusion yet, is that because it's just not a priority right now, or do you simply need to wait and, you know, see how the recovery plays out before reaching a -- a decision?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
jamie, i think what i would say is, you know, it's obviously less than today. we -- we need some time. we have i think some work in front of us to think through where we ultimately want that to be. but i think the important point is, you know, we're -- we're getting started and i think you see some of that.
during the quarter, we prepaid a -- our term loan that was matured in april for about $3 billion. we mentioned during the script that we do plan to make a pension contribution which, as you know, we consider part of our financial obligations. so, we are getting started. we don't have more specifics but we are getting started.
and, you know, we're -- we're very focused on that $350 million number that -- that i've described and using the liquidity that we have where it makes sense to drive that down.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and -- and just a fine point on -- on psp, a simple yes or no question. have -- have the terms been achieved? and if so, are they the same as the first round? thanks.
peter carter -- secretary, chief legal officer, and executive vice president
yeah, jamie, it's peter carter. the terms are identical to psp 1.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect.
peter carter -- secretary, chief legal officer, and executive vice president
we've already signed the agreement with the government.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you, everybody. take care.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks, jamie.
operator
our next question will come from hunter keay of wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
good morning. ed, about a year ago, we talked on this call about intentionally running lower load factors, and it's happening but in a weird way. but you're getting paid for it and your nps scores are, as you mentioned, at an all-time high. so, you know, unblocking middle seats is obviously a -- a tactical choice.
but even when you unblock them, you don't have to sell them. so, i guess the question is longer-term, how are you thinking about running less full airplanes as an opportunity to differentiate yourself for that premium traveler?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes, hunter, it is an interesting year, i'll -- i'll say that. we've not made a decision beyond the end of march relative to our -- when to unblock the middle seats, but we have some time to --to continue to look at that. i think it's going to be very much driven by customer demand, customer input, the confidence customers have in -- in their seats. but, you know, no question about it.
we are generating a meaningful premium due to that decision.
glen hauenstein -- president
hunter, if i could have just a quick follow-up on that. is there -- i guess are two ways, as we discussed last year, to do that. one is by creating more premium seats, and the other is by running lower load factors. as we go through this lead transition, premium seats as a percent of our total seats continue to rise.
and i think that's our primary way to satisfy the demand for premium customers is to continue to provide them with a higher level of quality.
hunter keay -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
got it. yeah. thank you, glen. and then on the 18,000 early outs, gary, or can you achieve 2019 capacity without backfilling any of those positions?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
could you speak louder, we missed your question -- the start of your question, hunter? or i did.
hunter keay -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
sorry, about that, ed. that's cool. the -- the -- the 18,000 early outs, the -- the question is like how much of -- can you achieve 2019 capacity levels without backfilling the majority or the entirety of those positions?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we can't achieve 2019 levels without plus 20% of our people, no question about it. there -- but there is -- we don't need to backfill it entirely either. so, you know, there's a -- there's a middle ground there.
hunter keay -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
ok. and then just one more quick one since we have 90 minutes just to -- to follow up on jamie's follow-up. have you -- peter, have you negotiated the -- the new strike prices for the ones attached to psp too?
peter carter -- secretary, chief legal officer, and executive vice president
we -- we -- we have and it's $39 and some change.
hunter keay -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and now we will go to andrew didora of bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. glen, my first question is for you, kind of little tough to answer. but just curious about how you are thinking about the kind of the trade-off between yield and load factor as you move through kind of the different phases of the recovery that you -- that you talked to. you know, as -- as those travel restrictions have eased, do you see a need to make stimulate more demand with price? or do you think there is enough pent-up demand in the network that, you know, load factors in the yield driver? just -- just curious how you're thinking about that?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think we're taking a yield bias as we go into the peak summer, hoping that demand exceeds supply. and if that doesn't materialize, we can make those adjustments later. but we have anticipated that there will be a -- a nice recovery in demand as we get toward the summer and we've taken a conservative approach. i hope that answers your question.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and -- certainly, have strung with it a bit. and -- and then, ed, i know gary gave some information about capex this year. but -- i guess, how are you thinking about that over the next few years, especially in light with your regard to -- to de-lever here. and what do you need to see in order to feel more comfortable in placing new aircraft orders? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, andrew, i think we're a little early yet in terms of thinking about the -- the long-term capex picture. i think, you know, we -- we moved $5 billion of aircraft capex alone over there to airbus out over -- over the next several years. you know, to -- to a degree to which we, you know, want to take positions -- new positions coming up, we'll -- we'll continue to evaluate that based on demand. but right now, i -- i feel pretty comfortable with where we sit.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
and now we'll go to brandon oglenski of barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
ok. good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. gary, can you talk about some of the structural things that you've taken out of the cost structure? can you reach that casm target by the end of the year? and i think you made a comment about incrementally like 40% to 50% of your fourth-quarter casm as a variable effect. did i hear that right?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
yes. so, brandon, let me -- let me start with the first question that the structural costs, the two biggest ones in our business are really, you know, headcount and fleet, as we mentioned. the fleet really determines an awful lot of the -- the infrastructure that we need from a -- from a cost standpoint. we expect to get leverage out of all of our costs associated with assets.
you know, we look about a third of our cost structure on a -- on monthly basis is fixed. so, as we grow, we'll -- we'll obviously get leverage there. and we have pockets of opportunity -- we have -- we have pockets of opportunity in -- in terms of better utilization of just the overall system. you know, when i -- when i think about what we're doing here, and this gets to your second question, there are -- there are kind of two big things that i talk about -- or that we all talk about internally as we think about this effort that we're embarking on.
the first is baseline aggressively, and it's really have a laser focus on what's in the cost structure now and what makes sense. and you see that in the 50% reductions that we've been posting now for several quarters. the second thing we say is leverage the build, and that's really where the -- the incremental thought process comes. that's about being very thoughtful about better leveraging the system as -- as we start to rebuild.
now, i think in terms of your second question, incremental costs, it's a -- you know, it's pretty simple the way we're thinking about it. it's just change in cost, divided by change in asms. and we wanted to give, you know, some guidepost as to the leverage that we do expect going forward for the -- excuse me, 40% to 50% of december capacity comes in. i'll just note, if you take a look at the second half of 2020, it was quite a bit better than that.
and that is why i emphasized that comment in the prepared remarks about how we scale the system, particularly in the fourth quarter.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
ok. good, sir. i think those were my few.
operator
our next question will come from ravi shanker of morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. a common question for business travel. you said that small and medium-sized corporates are coming back first.
are you surprised by that? and is -- is -- is that good news or bad news for, you know, when the bigger guys come back when the world opens up again?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
robin, we're -- we're not surprised by that. these are small business owners who need to get out to their customers, who have to work hard every single day to -- to keep their sales and their -- their business moving. and we do see a -- a meaningful continued improvement in -- in small business traffic. in some of that, we can measure.
others of that, we can't see because they're not under -- under contracts with us. but we know that considered an important part of -- of overall business travel. but i do want to talk about the overall corporate travel results. as you probably know, we extensively survey our corporate customers -- our large corporate customers on a -- on a quarterly basis, in addition to just being with them on a weekly basis, as to their thoughts on the return of travel.
and the -- the most recent survey that we conducted, which just ended a couple of weeks ago, indicated that 40% of -- of our big corporate customers expect they will be fully back to 2019 levels by 2022. and another 11% said that they expect to be fully back by 2023. so, that's little over 50% of the -- of the customers. and these are the people everyone's speculating what's going to happen to business travel.
these are the customers who make those decisions. seven percent said we'll never be back to 2019 levels, only 7%. and 42% said they -- they weren't sure, needed more time to figure it out. so, with all the -- the dialog and speculation around the depth of business travel, just looking at that survey, it's very interesting.
if you take the 51% that said they'll be fully back by '23, the majority of which is in '22. and then you consider the second quadrant the -- the 50%, who said they'll never return or they're not sure of their return. and even if you assumed only 50% of their travel returns, that gets you 75% of the way back no later than '23. and i think that's a -- that's a very pessimistic view on business travel.
so, what we've been talking about corporate travel and business travel returning, i -- i felt optimistic when i saw those results. we know it's going to be different going forward. as i've said many times, it could be 10% to 20% lower over a period as it's substituted and complemented. there'll be different types of travelers, different reasons for people traveling.
but i think business travel has got a --a very, very strong opportunity to return over the next two years. and we're going to be well-positioned to carry it.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that is great color on the demand side of business travel. thank you for that. if i can just follow up with a question. the supply side, clearly, you guys are leaders from a corporate travel standpoint, but we have seen some of your lcc competitors start to maybe find -- make some inroad as that traffic comes back.
so, maybe you can give a -- can you give us more color on kind of how you maintain that leadership and through -- how you see the competitive environment looking like for business travel when that does come back?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i -- i think that the delta difference has never been more pronounced than it is right now. and if you look at our share of corporate travel that is traveling, we have experienced the highest levels in our history. so, demand for our products and services is incredibly high for people who want it. and i think that's where our challenge remains is to continue to provide industry-leading products and services that our -- our corporate travelers want and need.
and that's been what we've been doing over the past several years and what we'll continue to do as we get to the end of this pandemic. and i think that's going to be what differentiates us. and clearly, there's always people who would like to take that travel away from you, because it is some of the highest yielding travel in the system. but i think that's our goal.
and our mission is to stay ahead of that and provide it. through a poll, people want to fly delta. and as opposed to where you push which is, ""hey, we can lower fares and try and -- maybe off the sides for the bottom of this.""
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
and now our next question will come from catherine o'brien of goldman sachs.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thank you so much for the time. so, my first question is actually is about your comment earlier about seeing a cash recovery before revenue recovery. and -- and to try and square that with the 65% of your atl is vouchers.
you know, as -- as really early perspective, bookings are coming fairly during the year. are these majority new bookings, or -- or maybe there's a higher percentage of those vouchers that are -- are corporate and you expect that early part of it probably be leisure. i would just want some color on that comment. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah, catie. some -- some of that came through a little garbled, but let -- let me say this. i think the distinction is really about timing, you know, in the -- in the early -- in the -- in the spring, what we expect and mentioned it a few times, we think as confidence starts to build, what you'll see is that people will start booking for -- further out in the booking curve. and so, our -- we will have a build-in in our air traffic liability that helps us cross cash breakeven earlier in the spring.
p&l breakeven is -- is something that will take a little bit more. that's when, you know, our revenue is going to be covering our -- our expenses. and that is something that we expect will lag a little bit behind the build in bookings. and we'll be there by the summer, as we've mentioned.
glen hauenstein -- president
and maybe just a little bit on our redemptions for the e-credits is we are running in the low- to mid-teens right now in terms of total revenues with the e-credits coming back. and we expect that to stay below 20 as we move through this next -- next period here.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and that number has been pretty consistent throughout the entire year. so, we have a pretty good sense of what that's going to look like.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, understood. and -- and can you guys hear me a little bit better now?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
yes.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. understood. and i know you guys have one of the furthest out periods through which people can redeem. so, that -- that -- that makes sense.
you know, maybe one on the cost structure, you know, of course, the pandemic has created a lot of pain for the industry. but i -- i don't want to glaze over that. but, you know, outside of speeding up your fleet simplification, have you found other opportunities to make the operation more efficient. perhaps maybe speeding up some of your automation plans in the customer-facing side and wanted to hear about other opportunities that maybe have been born out of crisis.
thank you very much.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
we have katie, i'm not -- i'm not sure where to get into some of the specifics. i will say that the -- the fleet simplification has been, you know, something actually that we think is in our run rate today. you're seeing some of the benefit in the fourth quarter, but we -- it -- it -- it's something that will have a much bigger impact as we move to -- to rescale the network through 2021. you know, i -- when i -- when i -- when i mentioned the concept of leveraging the build, you know, and maybe one of the reasons why, you know, i'm thinking through it just as i'm thinking through it is there are a lot of things that, you know, we want to think about doing differently.
you know, one of the unique opportunities of -- you -- we always want to make something good out of what has transpired. and it does give us an opportunity to start fresh. one of the reasons that i think we are showing the kind of leverage as we rebuild is because we have a clean sheet of paper in -- in some sense to start from.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'd like to add to gary's comments. i -- i think it's remarkable, the work the team has done on the cost side to get out in the fourth quarter to the point where our all-in unit costs are 4.5% lower quarter-over-quarter, despite having over 40% less capacity to work with. it speaks to the -- the ingenuity of -- of the team. we're thinking as we -- as we speak what the -- what the -- not just the current environment, but the future environment is.
and these are not costs that we're deferring out into the future. we're -- we're making real changes real-time here. and it touches every part of our business. so, you know, it's -- it's been the -- since the demand has been low, you know, we've been all over costs the entire year and the team has done really, really good -- good work here.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, definitely a fantastic staff. they were able to saw it earlier. well, thank you all for the time.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from duane pfennigwerth of evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. you -- you covered this in pieces and i'll follow up to a couple of other analysts. but, you know, one of the things that delta has been talking about during this crisis was, which makes a lot of sense, is, you know, getting to 2019 casm on a capacity footprint that's smaller.
so, i -- i wonder if you'd kind of quantify how much smaller a footprint can -- can delta still deliver 2019 casm. and is the thinking or the logic, and the focus really more on casm recovery and margin recovery before necessarily capacity recovery.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
why not? i'll take that. listen, they're -- they're all interrelated. you need to put the revenue and the capacity out there in line with demand, not in line of your casm strategy. and -- and -- but they're -- they're certainly connected to the -- to the ability to drive costs down.
you know, one of the things that we have been a leader for many, many years, really the last decade, is on our upgauging strategy, domestic particularly. and that will continue to be important as we -- as we move forward and while we talk about simple flying to fleet, we've taken some big steps in that direction. we're also going to be advancing the -- the upgauging of the -- of the domestic fleet at the same time. so, that's a -- that's big contributor.
we'll continue to be a contributor with -- with both driving down costs as well as improving the customer experience in -- in revenue including premium revenue opportunities. you know, we've said in -- i said in my remarks that we are -- our goal is to get that 2019 unit cost by -- by the end of this year on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity level. we think -- think it's a pretty good marker. we -- we hope our capacity level is higher, i'll be honest you.
that the demand environment is -- is driving, but that's going to be driven by demand, not by cost.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
that -- that's very helpful. and then maybe just broad brushstroke -- strokes, you gave us the 75% by year-end. is that -- is that how we should be thinking about, you know, your view of exit rate? and -- and how are you thinking, again, it can change, but how are you thinking about the summer as a percent of 2019?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
no, we're not -- we're not using that as a guide for capacity levels. we're using that for our own internal calculus in terms of where we need to get our -- our cost structure down. it won't be 75%. it may be higher, maybe lower.
i don't know. that's a long way to go, you know, between here and there. and we'll keep you posted as we go.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then just -- just last one, maybe -- maybe a question from a -- from a different era. but could you -- could you walk us through the comps on revenue monthly? because it -- it seems like your guidance fits well, you know, january, february similar to kind of 4q levels. but -- but march, it seems like there is a wide range of outcomes on march and -- and obviously, the comps, you know, fall off materially, you know, middle of march.
so, i don't know if you have the data handy, but, you know, how much easier is -- is march and april relative to -- to kind of jan, feb?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
duane, we're -- we're not going back to -- to give the monthly -- monthly revenue guide. so, i'm sorry i'm going to have to pass.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
fair enough. the comps do get easier. thanks for taking the questions.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
i heard comps, will give you -- it -- it will be easier.
operator
and now we will go to you joseph denardi of stifel.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
as i said, good morning. ed, you -- you talked about the -- the corporate travel environment in a scenario where corporate traffic is impaired 15% to 20%. what does that mean for your al's earnings power, and why shouldn't we be concerned that -- that i guess that the fleet strategy is adding more premium seats into a declining premium market?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
joe, i -- i wouldn't draw the conclusion that corporate travel is impaired at all. in fact, i've -- i've not said that. i think we may see lower corporate travel, but i also think it will be changed, essentially a different mix. so, i don't think we should be for either ringing alarm bells relative to the future of corporate travel.
all indications are -- is corporate travel is ready to start coming back and will come back pretty aggressively beginning the second half of this year. we are -- we are a smaller airline with a 200 fewer planes today. we've already right-sized the business to be smaller, which will help protect the -- the -- the premium revenue sources and the margins of the business. and well, that's why we're, you know, we spent a lot of time on this call talking about our cost performance.
that's -- that's -- that's going to be the key to make sure that we protect the margins in an environment where corporate travel, you know, will be down for the -- for the foreseeable future. maybe it's permanently down by a little bit of lower amount, but i'm -- i'm not ready to declare that call yet.
glen hauenstein -- president
could i -- could i add something to that? is that i think when you think about our premium products and services, you also ought to think that these are not only filled by corporate travelers. as a matter of fact, only -- less than a third of the seats are actually filled by the corporate travelers, and two-thirds are filled by non-corporates. and i think it's our ability to provide the right products and services for the -- for non-corporates as well with the right sell-up opportunities so that we can match their preferences to our products and services. and i think that's really been one of the great hallmarks of the transformation is to say this is really available to everybody at reasonable prices.
and that's been our -- one of our key successes, i think.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. ed, it -- it's my understanding that owners of your skymiles debt are getting access to quarterly updated financial disclosures for skymiles, similar to those you provided when you marketed the transaction. it's my understanding that equity investors are not.
s -- so, my question for you is how is that fair? how do you expect your equity investors to make a fully informed decision on your stuff if they're not being provided with updated disclosures for what -- for what you guys have proven is your most valuable asset? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, joe, i'll let gary take that because he's closer to the financial disclosure. so, i would say, while the wealth department is a very important asset, our most important asset are our people. gary?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
yeah, joe. we, too, we are providing some disclosures to, you know, to those debt holders as you described. you know, look, i -- i think we agree with, you know, some of the sentiment that you have expressed over time. we-we see the value there.
i think glen did a good job of articulating how well it is holding up. we've been on a path to provide more information there. i think you'll have to be a little forgiving. we've -- we've had a lot on our mind.
and, you know, i think you can expect us to continue down that path for the reason -- for the very same reason that i think you've been asking for -- asking about it because we do see the value there.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and now, we will go to greg konrad of jefferies.
greg konrad -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning and thank you. just to follow up on -- on some of the past questions. i mean, i guess in terms of the competitive environment. your yields have held up relatively well, you know, only down 2% or 3% on a relatively short booking curve with reduced corporate travel.
i mean, how do you think about that potential trajectory for yield as you -- the booking curve normalizes and some of the corporate travel returns? i mean, is there opportunity to kind of be above where you were in 2019?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i think there is always opportunity to be above where we were in 2019. that's clearly our goal and, you know, and -- if it could be your short-term goal, it would be better. i think it's more a medium- to a long-term goal, but i think we are going to come out with a higher preference than we've ever had and that higher preference it will drive a higher demand set which should enable us to work on yields as we come out the back end of this. so, i -- i think it goes back to how did people react to the pandemic and how the delta's brand come through this.
and i think from all the research we've done and from all the data that we see that our brand has never been stronger and demand for our products and services has never been stronger on a relative basis. and we're planning on capitalizing on that on the backend of this.
greg konrad -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. and then just one quick follow-up, just a clean-up question. i mean, how should we think about refinery sales for the year? any change versus what you saw in q4?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
what are -- are you referring to the third-party sales? is that what you are asking now?
greg konrad -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah, sorry. the third party.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
yes. the phenomenon that you're seeing in the third-party sales is, you know, anything we produce and do not exchange for jet fuel, we sell to third parties. obviously, with our jet consumption being weighed down, we've had a lot more of those sales to third parties. so, i -- that is going to likely trend with, you know, how we rebuild our network and -- and how much jet fuel we're consuming.
i do think it's important to point out that those sales have no margin. if you look in some of the reconciliations in the back of the release, you'll see that those are offset dollar by -- dollar for dollar rather on the cost side. so, they're all wrapped into the economics of the refinery, but you should expect those to start trending down as our consumption picks back up and we're exchanging more for our own use.
greg konrad -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and next, we will go to mike linenberg of deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. hey -- hey -- and i'd just like to just go back on the, you know, mandatory covid test for international arrivals. are you aware of any potential carve-outs, you know, like for those 24, 48-hour roundtrips? and if you would have a vaccine to be vaccinated, would you be precluded from actually having to provide that test on entry?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hey, mike, it's ed. you know, we're still working through the -- the guidance from the cdc we're involved in.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we -- we have mentioned -- i -- i've personally cited a number of conversations with dr. redfield on this. so, we've -- we've mentioned the -- the need to consider some waivers in unusual circumstances where, for example, covid testing resources are not available or if there are some -- some relatively short term, as you mentioned, air travel. so, we're working through the -- the implementation details.
i think it's absolutely right thing to do for the long term for our industry. but it's going to -- it's going to create some -- some short-term hiccups.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, great. and then, just a question to glen and -- and possibly peter carter. i know that -- that you had sort of deferred on trip for all american. what i am more interested is that it looks like as part of that transaction, it does look like that there's going to be a slot device -- divestiture and that would obviously be at airports that are near and dear to delta.
are those slots that -- from what you know, are those slots that only new entrants can bid on? or are those slots that all carriers can bid on? and if that's the case, is that something that would interest delta? thank you.
peter carter -- secretary, chief legal officer, and executive vice president
so, the dot has not made it clear what the rules are with respect to those slots, but i -- i think it's -- it's, suffice it to say, that we are deserving in dta without question because of our market position.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
and now, we will go to david vernon of bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning. so, ed or gary, could you talk to how -- as we move through these extra phases, how and when discretionary cost may come back in the system? i am wondering if there is going to be a need to -- to -- to prime the pump a little bit on the costs side to prepare for what should be a pretty -- pretty steep recovery as vaccination rollout.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
well, there -- there will be some, david. we expect, you know, for example, to have reactivation expenses around the maintenance in aircraft, you know, through the remainder of the year. so, we expect that pace to continue. i'm -- i'm not sure i quite heard the -- the non -- was it discretionary or non-discretionary expenses that you were asking?
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
yeah. i -- i imagine you guys have -- have curtailed a lot of -- of discretionary expense, so there is marketing, right, new development or systems work, or training programs what have you. i am just wondering if there's -- if there's going to be a need to --to step up that spend ahead of recovery here in the -- in the intervening months?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
well, i'd prefer to think of it not to pick it up before recovery. but i, you know, we will have a need to -- to revisit some of the things that we've done. you know, if you -- if you take a look, david, at what we're pointing to in terms of incremental costs that we lever -- as we leverage the network, it does look different than what we saw in the second half of 2020. and one of the reasons is, you know, we -- we do expect to have pressure and pockets.
we have to be really mindful and balance some of those needs with the realities of the business because we are determined here to turn the -- to turn the profit equation around and to be printing these releases with black ink this year.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hey, david, this is ed. let me -- let me -- let me expound on that just a bit. we -- we are -- leveraged maintenance expenses. we've got our -- our staffing levels back to where we need to be starting the first of this year.
we -- we started to pay in terms of some of the -- the -- the pay cut -- the voluntary pay cuts that -- that our -- our employees took last year. so, there is a meaningful step-up already in the numbers we gave you for the cash burn in the first quarter to get ready for the -- the recovery. so, i'm very comfortable with where we sit. in fact, if we wanted to continue to run the same cost structure and forego some of those expense if you'd see our cash burn coming down in a -- in a relatively meaningful level to -- in -- in the first quarter as well.
but we've -- we've maintained the same level of cash burn to get ready for the -- for the spring.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ed, that's helpful. and then maybe just as a -- as a follow-up, you know, you noted in the release the amount of capex that's come out of the budget over the next couple of years. i'm wondering if there's been a discussion at the board level about goalposts or guideposts for profitability before we kind of go back to renewing the fleet in earnest?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
david, again, i think that question is a little premature. yes, we -- we talked about that topic of the board. we also haven't made any determinations quite yet. the goal we have at the board is very much what we said to you, is that we get through -- our goal is to get through a cash-break-even position for the second quarter and return to profitability starting in the third quarter.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
all right. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
right to the other -- the -- the pace of that -- of that recovery over the next couple of years, obviously, we still have some work to do here.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok, thanks.
jill greer -- investor relations
cathy, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts, if you can queue that.
operator
certainly, and that question will come from joe caiado of credit suisse.
joe caiado -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thanks for the time. ed, glen, just a quick clarification question regarding your annual corporate travel survey. one,.40% of respondents say fully recovered by 2022.
are they referring to their businesses being fully recovered by 2022, or their corporate travel budgets being fully recovered by then? or -- or did they see as one and the same?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
their corporate travel being back by that.
joe caiado -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it, ok. understood. it's helpful. and my second question just -- it's clear that you're not seeing any elongation of the booking curve yet at this stage.
but -- but what about clicks or looks, you know, stopping short of actual bookings? but is there any data like that that you're tracking analytics on the website, something like that, that provides a basis for your recovery outlook beyond q1 and -- and sort of saying that you have a good shot of p&l breakeven in q3? or you're just, you know, hopeful that that's going to be the case? is there -- are there any analytics that you can share with us that -- that maybe give you a better indication? thank you for the time?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
absolutely. corporate, looks are -- are actually doing quite well. we're 40% up over-- quarter-over-quarter of where we were last quarter in terms of looks. and look-to-book is very low.
so, people are looking, they're aspiring to travel and they're just not ready to commit yet. and i think that's what really gives us that sense that there will be a time which people feel comfortable again to travel. and that will -- will turn into a click, turn into a booking. and so, we are monitoring that very, very carefully.
and we're looking forward to the opportunity to serve these customers as they come back.
joe caiado -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for that color.
operator
that's going to wrap up the analysts' portion of this call. i will turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, good morning, everybody. i want to thank all the members of the media who have gathered on the -- the call today. your interest in -- in delta is not only appreciated, it's never been greater. and we're very pleased today to provide you with an extended period of time to -- to make sure that we address your questions.
i'd also like to thank ed and -- and glen and the members of the delta leadership committee, all of whom are on this call for their involvement as we turn the page on 2020 and -- and optimistically look at 2021. so, cathy, if -- if you could please review the -- the instructions and mention to everyone how they go about asking a question?
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] and we'll go first to alison sider of the wall street journal.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the operational issues we saw around the holidays, you know, thanksgiving and christmas. and, you know, what -- looking back and think were kind of the root causes of -- of that. and, you know, what if any changes you've made prevents this same sort of thing from happening again?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure, ali. we certainly had a much better christmas holiday than the -- the thanksgiving break. there were a number of factors going on in the com -- staffing levels of the company with a lot of the changes that we -- we had implemented. and you couple that with -- with covid and some of the exposures which everyone's seeing the -- the no fly capability of -- of some of our staffing which came in.
we learned from that for thanksgiving. we've made some -- some pretty aggressive changes in december in terms of getting the schedule fine-tuned to -- to -- to anticipate that. and we're in really, really good shape and then we got hit with a -- a massive storm in minneapolis on the december 23, which -- which cost us probably a -- a couple of hundred cancels -- incremental cancels over that -- that next couple of day timeframe which-which was concerning, but un -- unavoidable, unfortunately. the -- the most important thing in all of that is one, the -- the delta people -- and i know there were some bloggers out there wondering whether the -- the -- the delta pilots weren't doing everything they can.
the delta pilots were amazing through the both holiday periods and showing up and -- and -- and getting the flights going and giving up their holidays and their -- their time away with their families to help the company out. so, it had nothing to do with pilot staffing at all. the -- the other thing was the number of customers who may have been canceled, while that's -- it's higher than we've been expecting, the vast majority of the people got to their destination within hours of their -- their -- their booking at scheduled times. so, the teams did very, very good job and -- and that issue was pretty much over with by the 26th, 27th.
glen hauenstein -- president
and -- and that really manifests itself in the record net promoter score we had in the december time period. so, as i've mentioned, despite the fact that we had to cancel some flights, our average lateness was not very late versus the original itinerary. and our customers over the holiday period were quite satisfied posting record-high net promoter scores.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
and just a follow-up, is there anything you can show about what you're seeing in terms of, you know, crew member infections at this point. you know, i know the -- the pilots have said they saw some big increases in covid infections, you know, in late fall. i'm just wondering if you're still seeing that or -- or if that's sort of been brought under control?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, you know -- you know, we're -- we're a microcosm of the -- of the country. and as the pandemic has accelerated over the course of the last few months, in order to accelerate across airline employees as well. but, you know, our team's doing a real job. we're not seeing it spread within the company when we're at work, it's -- it's, unfortunately, com -- community is where the -- where -- where people are getting sick.
so, i tell you, every -- every work category of -- of the company is experiencing an increase in exposures as we've all -- have seen over the last couple of months.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and now we will go to tracy rucinski of reuters.
tracy rucinski -- thomson reuters -- u.s. aviation correspondent
hi, good morning. i'm wondering if you think we'll see covid-19 testing being required for domestic flights.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
tracy, i don't think so.
tracy rucinski -- thomson reuters -- u.s. aviation correspondent
ok. and just to follow up with a separate question, should we expect to see a deal with boeing this year for a 737 max order?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
we --- we're not going to speculate on that.
tracy rucinski -- thomson reuters -- u.s. aviation correspondent
ok. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sorry.
operator
and now, we'll go to claire bushey of financial times.
claire bushey -- financial times -- correspondent
hello. i know delta has been growing its own list of people who are not able to fly in the airline. but i was wondering if the company had any visibility into whether more names are being added to the federal no fly list based on last week's capitol attacks?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
sorry, your -- your -- your -- the -- the last part was real garbled. is your question if -- are we adding increased numbers to our no fly list based on federal information?
claire bushey -- financial times -- correspondent
i -- i was asking whether the -- i was asking whether delta knows if names are being added to the federal no fly list based on the capitol attacks.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
we certainly know that the tsa is looking very carefully at the -- at those that were in the capitol building, the writers. and we are -- we are working closely with them and i do anticipate if the tsa, you know, is able to identify individuals who have people added to the no fly list. no question about it.
claire bushey -- financial times -- correspondent
thank you.
operator
and next, we have leslie josephs of cnbc.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter -- cnbc
hi, good morning, everybody. you mentioned that there was a lot of pent-up demand and also those hoarding of points from the frequent-flyer program. what happens if a lot of people try to redeem it once? is that something that you're expecting based on search data and other things? and then also you mentioned a recovery in the second half of the year. where are you seeing demand? are those sort of outdoor social distancing destinations showing more strength than -- than others? and where is that demand coming from? thanks.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, clearly leisure destinations are at the forefront of the recovery right now. and i -- i think it doesn't matter whether or not it's a beach or a mountain peak that's where people are headed at this point in the recovery. and then your second question was --
leslie josephs -- airline reporter -- cnbc
about the e-points. so, if you are reporting -- yeah. what happens if everyone -- i know you're foreseeing that they -- they will are trying to redeem?
glen hauenstein -- president
we're -- we are -- we are happy and -- and really have the -- or indifferent whether or not people who are booking are using points or whether or not they're using actual dollars or whether they're using the e-credits. what we are anticipating is a -- that all of those will increase. and we have plenty of capacity to -- to meet that demand as we head to the second half of '21. so, we're hoping that all of the above happens.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter -- cnbc
ok. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
you know, the -- the -- you know, from talking to american express, our good partners there, it's clear that people place great value on their -- on their loyalty points with delta and like to see the values grow over time. and so, while they've -- they've been in the pandemic, we've -- we've -- we've seen redemptions down for points because, you know, flying levels are down. but they haven't stopped, you know, the spending on the card, our co-brand card is as good if not better than almost any other product card amex has. so, it has great appeal and we expect it's not going to be -- not going to be a run-on-the-bank type situation that you're referring to.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter -- cnbc
ok. you could just adjust the words, the availability, and things like that too, right?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
absolute -- absolutely. we're looking forward to that day.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter -- cnbc
thank you.
operator
and now, we will go to david koenig of the associated press. david?
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
hi, real quick question. unless i missed it, i have not heard an update in a while in the number of people you have banned for not wearing face masks. is there a current figure on that? and any changes in -- in-cabin policies?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
i -- i think that number is north of 800 at this point, david.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok. ok. very good. and then how many of those are since last week, you know?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
a number. not a huge number, but a number.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok.
operator
and now, our question will come from kelly yamanouchi of the atlanta journal-constitution.
kelly yamanouchi -- atlanta journal-constitution -- business reporter
hi there. i wanted to ask about profit-sharing with no profit-sharing next month from 2020 results. so, i was wondering what impact you think that may have on employees and satisfaction? and also, wondering if there's a -- if you think there's a possibility of profit-sharing a year from now?
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
well, i think everyone is aware why there's not profit-sharing in -- in this year. and i can tell you the employee satisfaction is at a very -- a very high level. i -- i mentioned during this trip, kelly, that we just were awarded as the 7th best employer by glassdoor. glassdoor is an entirely employee-driven acknowledgment.
the company hasn't had any -- any input or any insight into that. that's -- that's purely by employees talking about their employers. so, if that gives you a sense for the sentiment, the sentiment is very strong. the volunteerism with the, you know, tens of thousands of people that have taken unpaid leaves of absence over the year indicates that.
we've been mindful of -- of the fact that there won't be a profit-sharing payout. and we're providing added services and assistance around financial health and financial wellbeing, in -- in credit counseling, and -- and other services to employees that may need it. we're going to be ramping -- we have been ramping it up and talking about it. we're going to continue to talk about it on an -- on an on-going basis going forward.
we have people providing that support. and relative to the, you know, next year's profit-sharing, i certainly hope we'll be -- we'll be paying it. it's -- it's hard to speculate it now. it's -- it's just only a couple weeks into the year.
but, you know, i'm hopeful that we'll be paying it.
kelly yamanouchi -- atlanta journal-constitution -- business reporter
great. i also heard mentioned during the call so far about the value of connecting economics, but also the importance of point-to-point and focus cities. i was wondering if you expect -- how you expect the atlanta hubs' role to be different going forward in terms of size, or the role in your network.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, clearly, the size of atlanta is relative to the size of demand in the united states. as the world's largest hub, it is a microcosm of global airline demand. so, we expect it to recover as -- as -- as the airline continues to recover. the two things that i would say is that we're going to continue to work on average gauge which i think is something that's really important and that will be bringing more details about, but bigger airplanes with better products and services.
and so, i think you'll see, you know, the departures get back to 2019 levels at some point in the future. but before that, you'll probably see the employments start to rise dramatically and -- and using really the gauge lever as much as the departure level. this is, as you know, our most valuable asset here in atlanta and we're very proud to -- to be a part of the atlanta community. and -- and it has led us in the rebuild of our network so far.
kelly yamanouchi -- atlanta journal-constitution -- business reporter
great, thank you so much.
operator
our next question will come from ted reed with forbes.
ted reed -- forbes -- airlines reporter
thank you for taking the questions. i have two questions for glen. first one, glen, when you said earlier delta is ready when you are. talking about when you come back, were you talking about in terms of capacity or something else?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think that when customers are -- are wanting to fly on delta, we'll be ready for them. and, you know, i know you're -- i know you for a long time and i know you remember that slogan. so, it's hearkening back to a little bit of history there with delta.
ted reed -- forbes -- airlines reporter
so, you're just saying, you'll be ready. that you'll have the capacity suited to what you anticipate customers will want?
glen hauenstein -- president
correct.
ted reed -- forbes -- airlines reporter
all right. secondly, we've been talking a lot about the middle seats being empty and being a -- you said a powerful tool. how are you measuring what the value -- how can you tell that these are so valuable to their -- to your customers?
glen hauenstein -- president
our revenue premiums have never been higher. and so, customers are valuing the delta difference. and i think that's how we're looking at that is when you look at our revenue production versus our competitive set, despite having the least amount of salable capacity, our revenues have kept pace. so, i think, you know, we're seeing a -- not only the highest share of corporate demand we've ever had, although albeit on depressed levels, but a -- a real differentiator when customers are shopping to want to fly delta -- versus some of our competitors.
ted reed -- forbes -- airlines reporter
and you think that's due to middle seats being emptied longer than -- other -- others?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think -- i think it's an entire delta difference. clearly, that's a piece of it. but, you know, whether or not it's the delta care standard, whether or not it's the delta people, which are really, really at the heart of that. but this is one component of ensuring that delta is seen as a brand you want to associate with.
ted reed -- forbes -- airlines reporter
all right. thank you. i appreciate it.
operator
and now we'll go to dawn gilbertson of usa today.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- journalist
hi, good morning. i also have questions on your middle-seat policy. ed and glen, i know you both said no decision has been made yet. but glen, your comment about, you know, in the second phase that the middle seats will be a very powerful tool.
it sounds to me at least like you're certainly leaning toward unblocking them. a, is that a fair assumption? b, can you talk to us about the timing of this decision? when -- when will you decide whether they are blocked beyond march 30? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
dawn -- dawn, this is ed. no, i would not say that's a fair assumption. you know, what we've -- we've said is that when the demand returns, which is that next inflection point, that will inform our decision around what to do with the middle seats. so, we've -- we've not made any -- any decisions to -- to unblock them post -- post-march 30.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- journalist
and could you -- can you give us a sense of when and when will you make that decision? because pretty soon, i know the booking curve is still so short, but you're -- you're kind of optimistic about summer? so, will you make that decision in the next month, the next few weeks, a couple of months? can -- can you give us any sense of that, please?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, we'll -- we'll -- we continue to monitor on a regular basis. it's not imminent. we have -- we have some -- some bit of time, but it's going to be informed by customers' sentiment demand. you know, we -- we have in addition to middle seats, we have a lot of other seats still, i think, on our -- on our planes.
and confidence in travel relative to covid and vaccine deployment. so, yeah, it's -- it's not a -- a clear -- a clear line and there's a -- there's a lot that has to go into that. we know that it's been a -- a -- an important -- not the only, but one of the important reasons why delta has been able to earn -- continue to earn an even higher revenue premium during this past year than we've historically had. and so, we want to be very -- very careful as to how we make that decision.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- journalist
thank you very much.
operator
and now, we will go to [inaudible].
unknown speaker
hi, yes. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the changes in the competitive environment. american jetblue, alliance, the northeast, and then how that -- how -- how you intend to respond to that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
no. i -- i think we're very confident in our products and services. and we compete well against both those carriers individually and i'm sure we'll compete very well against them together. so, we have a -- we have lot of confidence in our products and services in the northeast.
unknown speaker
ok. and then there's also been some expansion of some of your focus cities, raleigh-durham, austin. does delta plan to -- to return there and compete there as well?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
focus cities will be an important part of our -- of our portfolio moving forward. and -- and we'll continue to work on making sure that we have the great capacity in those cities as demand returns. and so, we're looking forward to demand continuing to return in -- in all of our focus cities.
unknown speaker
thank you.
operator
and now we will go to robert silk with travel weekly.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
well, thanks for taking my call. simple question, do you see -- has cdc given any indication -- i know that a4a had called for -- test -- wanted testing there on you all, have wanted testing to be put in place. but in exchange, a rollback of travel bans. any indication if that could be the next coming?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. i -- your -- your -- your question, i'm sorry, was -- was a bit garbled. could you repeat that? we're having a hard time with some of our communications this morning.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
can you hear me a little better now?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
ok. so, the question is, any indication or sense from -- from the federal government cdc that with this blanket testing requirement that there could be a rollback of -- of travel bans, which is something that the air -- the airlines have called for? and then -- and -- and i'll also follow the other -- another question is any sense that vaccines ultimately could be included in the mix? if you're vaccinated it relieves testing requirements, so it could be an either/or?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we're still working with the cdc on the specific testing strategy and deployment. this is something that we, you know, delta endorse. i know our industry similarly endorses. we would like to see the travel restrictions lifted once the testing protocols are in place and that will be a decision by the new administration.
it's my understanding when they -- when they take office. and -- but i think by having the testing protocols in place, it then gives confidence to the regulatory authorities to start to lift the bans, which is why we endorse the -- the testing -- the testing strategy. your question relative to vaccines, yes. obviously, once vaccines are at scale, we would hope that vaccination evidence would -- would -- would supplant the -- the need to show a test result.
but of course, we're still working with the authorities on that.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
ok, thanks.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
cathy, we have time for one final question for the group, please.
operator
certainly. and that will come from david slotnick of business insider.
david slotnick -- business insider -- senior transportation reporter
hey, everyone. how are you? thanks for the question. i -- i'm just wondering what the phases -- the three phases that glen outlined earlier. you know, with that timing in mind and with the responses that you've gotten from the corporate travelers, is delta still expecting, you know, a recovery to 2019 revenue and travel levels in line with the rest of the industry with the, i think, it was 2023 or 2024, the iata.
and if you're able -- previously forecasting, or has that moved up for you at all?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
again, i'm -- i'm sorry. it's hard to -- to hear the question. let me take a shot at it. the -- the information we shared on the call about corporate travel is -- is the sentiment we're getting from our own customers.
as you are aware, we are the largest carrier of corporate travel among the -- among the u.s. carriers. so, i think we have the -- probably some of the best insights. as for to iata or any other group that, you know, i -- i don't know how they -- they determine what 2023 to 2024 looks like.
i wouldn't take too much confidence in that. but what our -- what our corporate travelers -- corporate travel managers are telling us is that 50% expected to be fully back by 2023. the other 50% is largely uncertain, but we -- we expect a meaningful amount of -- of -- of that travel to return as well.
david slotnick -- business insider -- senior transportation reporter
makes sense. so, delta have a forecast for when you'll return to 2019 travel levels?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
the -- the numbers we're comparing are 2019 travel volumes, yes.
david slotnick -- business insider -- senior transportation reporter
ok, thanks.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, david. with that, we'll turn it over to ed to make some final comments. again, thank you, everybody, for your time this morning.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
so, thanks, tim. just in -- in closing, i think you can all appreciate that 2020 was a difficult year, but we're on a recovery path. we see that the start of it beginning to crystallize here, particularly with the vaccine development. and as you've heard earlier, with glen and gary, i'm confident that we've got the foundation in place to return delta to revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow generation.
we're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. we'll continue to listen to our customers and put them first in order to further enhance their experience on delta, increase their loyalty, and drive affinity toward our brand. we're very focused on innovations, which is allowing us not only to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiency but also to tackle the big challenges that still lie ahead for us. we'll remain very focused on cost performance, we talked a lot about that during the call, to ensure that the leisure-led demand environment that -- that emerges, we'll be able to respond to it.
and finally, we're committed to reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating long-term shareholder value, and allowing our owners to participate in future upside without dilution. and we have the very best employees in the industry and we're ready to see this strategy through, which gives me optimism, confidence in our ability to thrive and emerge as the industry leader. so, thanks again for joining us today. and we look forward to speaking with you soon.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta airlines december quarter and full-year 2020 financial results conference call. my name is cathy and i will be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. and now, i'd like to turn the conference over to jill greer, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
jill greer -- investor relations
thanks, cathy. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for december quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; and our interim co-cfo, gary chase. our entire leadership team is available for the q&a session.
ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy, glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and gary will discuss cost liquidity and our balance sheet. we've extended our call today to 90 minutes total to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. for analysts, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get your -- to as many of you as possible. after the analyst q&a, we'll move to our media questions.
afterwards, ed will provide some closing remarks. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings.
we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures and all results excluded special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, jill. good morning, everyone. this morning we reported pre-tax losses of $2.1 billion for the december quarter and $9billion for the full year, capping the toughest year in delta's history. we've been saying all along that this recovery wouldn't follow a straight line with demand choppiness as covid infections rose across the country.
and government and public health officials issued travel advisories. our revenues of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter were just 30% of last year's levels. and although we still have a tough winter ahead of us, we're encouraged by the progress that's been made on the vaccine front and are confident that delta is positioned to successfully lead our industry into recovery as the year unfolds. though 2020 was a challenging year, we delivered results for all of our stakeholders.
for our employees, we prioritized protecting their health and safety and preserving our culture. for example, throughout the past year, we have offered and continue to offer an extensive employee testing program and pay protection programs for employees diagnosed, exposed, or at high risk of covid-19. we have had remarkable volunteerism up to 40,000 employees taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer to protect jobs and preserve cash. and in fact, we still have over 10,000 employees in the month of january out on unpaid leaves.
and we have made it through this year without furloughing any employees. our emphasis on taking care of our people is reflected in delta's recognition this week by glassdoor as one of the best places to work for the fifth year in a row, coming in seventh overall on a list of 100 large companies, the highest rank delta has ever received, all in the face of a pandemic, really incredible work by our team. for our customers, we're keeping them at the center of our recovery. our health and safety efforts for being the only major u.s.
airline that continues to block middle seats, to partnering with leading names, like the mayo clinic, emory healthcare, lysol, and purell in developing the delta care standard, to launching the industry's first covid-tested transatlantic flights with no quarantine on arrival, are all targeted at restoring consumer confidence in travel, and reopening borders, which will be an important driver of revenue growth in the future. our customers recognize the outstanding service our people provide with an all-time high december net promoter score of 71, up 20 points year-over-year, and by business travel news naming delta the top airline for corporate travelers for the 10th year in a row, and once again coming in first place on all 12 metrics that they measure in the survey. that customer preference and loyalty is what underlies our revenue premium and has never been stronger. and finally, for our shareholders, we secured our liquidity position and rescaled our cost structure.
we reduced liquidity risk by raising over $25 billion in capital since the pandemic began. with approximately $17 billion of liquidity, our adjusted net debt however only increased $8 billion year-over-year and we don't expect that net debt will increase going forward. we've swiftly removed cost from the business with three consecutive quarters of operating expenses declining by nearly 50% or more, increasing the variable nature of our cost structure. in fact, in the december quarter, our all-in unit costs were down 4.5% year-over-year despite flown capacity being down 44%.
that is a remarkable achievement and credit to all delta employees for making that happen. and by keeping our cost under control, we've leveraged the modest increase in net sales to reduce our average daily cash burns $12 million a day for the december quarter, half of what it was in the september quarter, and a decrease of 90% since the early days of the pandemic in late march. turning to 2021, we expect the march quarter to look similar to the december quarter, with march quarter revenues at 35% to 40% of march quarter 2019 levels, and our cash burn for the quarter holding at $10 million to $15 million per day. we expect that will be followed by an inflection point this spring as vaccine distribution continues, travel restrictions start to ease, and consumer confidence begins to grow, hopefully resulting in cash burn reaching breakeven or better by the second quarter.
and as the year progresses, we expect demand will start to accelerate as vaccinations become more widespread and the virus is in a contained state, and customers gain greater confidence to make future travel commitments. this should enable a sustained recovery to begin in the second half of 2021, with a return to profitability this summer. so, as we work through this environment, we're focused on five things. first, as always, we're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged.
the delta people are our most strategic asset. we have done a tremendous job this year, and together we'll lead our airline through the recovery. second, we'll continue to prioritize the customer with a focus on health and safety, and the maintenance of delt -- of the industry's strongest network, thereby increasing loyalty and preference for our brand. customers have shown they are willing to pay more for the quality of our network, product, and our service.
the gains we've achieved in customer satisfaction position us well to drive sustainable revenue growth in the future. third, we'll maintain our focus on innovation, which will enable our employees improve the customer experience and drive efficiency through the business. and innovating thinking will power our ability to tackle big challenges in front of us, like our goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the next decade. fourth, we'll drive a competitive cost structure.
given the changes we've made over the last year, our goal is to sustain our non-fuel unit cost at or below 2019 levels by the december quarter of this year, and roughly 75% of 2019 capacity levels, displaying continued agility in managing our costs. and finally, we are committed to debt reduction and creating long-term shareholder value, including continuing to protect our owners, so that they can participate in future upside without dilution. because for investors, while the near-term demand path is murky, industry fundamentals remain intact. following almost a year of subdued travel, customers are beginning to exhibit behavior that is indicative of pent-up demand.
shopping visits across delta's digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we're carrying. in our most recent corporate survey, 40% of respondents expect full recovery by 2022. our partners at american express are also seeing encouraging signs, whether it's cardholders holding on to their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel, for a recent survey that suggested approximately 70% of respondents expect to take a trip in 2021 after not traveling in 2020. although it will take time, customers want to travel again when they feel it's safe.
they feel they've had a year of their life taken from them, and they're starting to get ready to reclaim it. until then, we're fortunate to have the support of the u.s. government which recognizes the importance of the airline industry, and we thank congress and the administration for passing the covid relief bill last month. as a result of that bill, we anticipate receiving approximately $3 billion in addition -- in additional payroll support funds, largely on terms similar to the initial cares act program.
these funds have been critical in saving thousands of industry jobs during an unprecedented level of demand decline, and it's why the u.s. airline industry is in the best position to recover from the pandemic over any other international market. so, while 2020 was a difficult year and challenges will continue in 2021, i'm encouraged by some of the data that we're seeing and i'm proud of the foundation that we've built at delta. this company is well-positioned to emerge in a stronger competitive position from this crisis and we'll continue to lead our industry in the years ahead.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
thanks, ed, and good morning, everyone. as ed mentioned, we started the december quarter seeing encouraging demand trends. but with rising covid cases and travel advisory, we began to see some weakness around thanksgiving and into december. despite that softness, the peak periods continue to outperform non-peak periods, and we've seen sequential improvement in total revenues which recovered from being down 80% in the september to down 70% in the december quarter on salable capacity that was down 62%.
on january 3, we had a $15 million ticket revenue day and carried more than 250,000 customers. both of these were the highest since the onset of the pandemic. and despite having meaningfully less inventory per sale given our middle seat block, we outperformed on passenger revenue generation in the first nine months of the year. this is a testament to customers' willingness to pay a premium for the delta difference.
leisure markets and sun destinations are the best performers in our network. with our approach of targeting salable capacity to match demand, we are biasing restoring capacity to leisure markets. as result, roughly one-third of our domestic capacity is currently deployed into leisure destinations. our coastal hubs, especially new york and boston, are still some of the weakest areas in our network with demand in those hubs only 20% to 25% recovered.
international demand remains weak and is limited to essential travel. that said, we continue to work toward opening additional covid-tested lanes of travel with no quarantine on arrival, similar to our atlanta and rome -- atlanta to rome and atlanta to amsterdam flights. this will be important in restoring confidence in long-haul international travel as vaccine rollouts continue. our premium seat strategy is holding up well.
domestic premium revenues performed in line with main cabin in the quarter. a good outcome considering that we are continuing to operate largely -- in largely leisure-driven environment with a higher proportion of premium seats held back due to our middle seat blocks. as all of you are aware, corporate demand continues to be depressed and was only 10% to 15% restored for the quarter. corporate revenue was about 3 points higher than the september quarter with small and medium accounts which make up half of our corporate revenues recovering five points faster in large corporates.
while the passenger revenue environment remains challenging, we're encouraged that efforts to diversify our revenue streams have paid off. our american empress remuneration in 2020 was nearly $3 billion, down only 30% on a year-over-year basis. in fact, american express has shared its spending on our co-branded card portfolio has performed in line to slightly better than their overall card portfolio spend in 2020. in the december quarter, mro revenue was down almost 30% relative to the same period last year, while cargo revenue was up 10% on year-over-year basis.
this marks the first quarter of cargo revenue growth since the december 2018 quarter. our december quarter results reflect the challenges that the pandemic has brought not just to delta but to the entire airline industry. i am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire delta team in managing through the challenging year that we faced. now that we think about 2021, we see three distinct phases to the year.
and for each phase, we have levers to help us react to the emerging demand environment. in the first phase, we expect demand shopping is to continue, the booking curve to remain more compressed, and results to be similar to the december quarter. in response, we're focused on making sure that our salable capacity largely aligns with the emergence -- emerging demand environment. for example, our january and february domestic schedule seats will be down 3% to 6% versus the non-holiday period in november.
that will result in our march quarter salable capacity being approximately 55% lower relative to the same period in 2019, consistent with the expected 60% to 65% revenue decline. we'll also continue to leverage our non-ticket revenue streams like cargo, royalty, and mro that we believe should continue to outperform passenger revenues. in the second phase, vaccination distribution continues, travel restriction and advisory begin to ease, and customer confidence begins to grow. as that happens, we expect to see an extension of booking curve resulting in a cash-led recovery with revenue recovery to follow.
we anticipate this will happen in the spring and will result in us achieving our cash burn break-even targets. in response to the second phase, our middle seats will be a very powerful tool for us, one we can use to add capacity in a very cost-efficient way generating a meaningful margin tailwind. in the final phase, vaccinations become more widespread and offices begin to reopen. we expect that to occur in the second half of '21.
and as a result, in a -- and result in a sustained improvement in demand and yield with progression in cash generation as the booking curve normalizes. with the recovery initially fueled by leisure demand, delta's success will be driven by our superior connecting economics through our core hubs domestically and our partner hubs internationally. the 34 new aircraft delivery this year will also leverage higher gauge and more efficient aircraft that produce lower seat costs, more premium seats, and a better customer experience. this will allow us to capitalize on our brand affinity and upsell opportunities which are enabled by the elimination of change fees for u.s.
customers and the redemption of e-credits. it will take longer for corporate demand to return, but we are encouraged by the results of our recent corporate survey. our corporate accounts are telling us that they largely anticipate returning to their offices and travel in the june and september quarters. they are also telling us by the end of '21, half are expecting to return to 50% to 100% of pre-covid domestic travel, and up to 50% of pre-covid international travel.
to our corporate customers, our commitment to you remains unchanged. delta is ready when you are. we will be ready to serve our corporate customers by leveraging the strongest domestic and international networks, rebuilding focus cities, and point-to-point flying based on customer needs, and by capitalizing on our efforts to always put the customer experience at the center of what we do. we're optimistic for the future having built the right foundation and focusing on what we can control.
we are confident in our ability to successfully navigate the post-pandemic recovery. and with that, i'll turn the call over to gary.
gary chase -- interim co-chief executive officer
thanks, glen, and good morning, everyone. let me touch on the fourth quarter in 2020, and then i'll turn to the outlook for costs in the balance sheet as we head into '21. our december quarter pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion is about $500 million better than the september quarter, given the revenue improvement glen just discussed combined with strong cost discipline. we reduced costs by approximately 50% from 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter.
more importantly, our costs were up just 6% from the third quarter on 30% capacity growth. and three-quarters of that increase came from higher fuel. total unit costs including fuel was down 4.5%, compared to 2019 on 44% lower-flown capacity. our average daily cash burn for the december quarter was $12 million, half of the third quarter's $24 million.
we closed the year with $16.7 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of $18.8 billion, up about $8 billion versus year-end 2019. now, as we look into the year ahead, improving demand fundamentals will underpin a transition of our financial focus from protecting our liquidity to positioning the company for a return to profitability and free cash flow. i will explain our approach to costs on our balance sheet as we make this transition. let's start with costs.
we need to stay flexible and maintain our discipline in order to position the company for the return to profitability ed mentioned, as we expect continued choppiness in demand in the early part of the year. we've already taken structural steps to resize our business. our two largest cost drivers, fleet and headcount, are both 15% to 20% smaller than they were in 2019. headcount reductions were a difficult but necessary decision.
it was hard to see 18,000 talented and dedicated co-workers leave, but it's a testament to the delta culture that these reductions were achieved entirely through voluntary means. we accelerated our fleet transformation by retiring aircraft with relatively short remaining lives and simplified our fleet by eliminating two entire families while increasing our gauge. on a run-rate basis, these changes will drive more than $400 million in annualized cost benefits. as we add capacity in '21, we will drive higher utilization of our system and we have room to rebuild our network from current levels at low incremental costs, approximately 40% to 50% of our december quarter non-fuel casm.
our goal is to produce and sustain non-fuel unit costs below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter. that cost focus will be a key driver of profitability later in the year when demand returns. looking to the march quarter, we're preparing for stronger demand by reactivating aircraft and restoring our people to full hours, driving about $200 million in additional costs versus the december quarter. our march quarter total operating expense will be 35% to 40% lower than march quarter '19 with a total unit costs including fuel down 5% to 10% on approximately 35% lower-flown capacity.
let's move now to capital, the balance sheet, and liquidity. as we begin the year, conditions are similar to where we exited 2020. a modest uplift in net sales should offset the cost investments we're making in the quarter. and as a result, we expect average daily cash burn between $10 million and $15 million, similar to the december quarter.
with further improvements in net sales as customers gain confidence, we expect our cash burn to cease this spring. with that goal in sight, we're turning our focus to how we will balance reinvesting in the business while reducing our debt levels. given our expectations for cash flow in '21 and proceeds from the psp extension, we expect our current adjusted net debt levels to be the high watermark for that important metric. for the full year, we're expecting $2.5 billion in gross capex, a significant reduction from the $4 billion to $5 billion that we were spending pre-covid.
we have $1.3 billion of aircraft purchase commitments for 34 new deliveries this year, which we have the option to fully finance, and about $1 billion in non-aircraft capex. including retirements, we expect our fleet count at the end of 2021 will be 15% smaller than at year-end '19, with total fleet declining from about 1,350 to about 1,130. an equal priority is to work on our balance sheet by reducing our liquidity and paying down debt. we have approximately $1.8 billion of debt maturities in '21 and $2.1 billion in '22.
our debt has an average interest rate of 4.6% which will drive approximately $350 million in quarterly interest expense. however, we will begin reducing those expenses by paying down debt this year. we do not have mandatory pension contributions until 2025 under airline relief, but we expect to make at least $500 million in voluntary contributions this year. in terms of a quarter-end outlook with about $3 billion in psp support expected from the government on march -- march quarter, we project ending the period with $18 billion to $19 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $18 billion.
let me close by saying this, the delta difference has never been more important. and i'd like to thank the delta team for delivering for each other and for our customers amid the industry's most challenging environment ever. because of your dedication, we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever. with that, i'll turn the call back over the jill to begin the q&a.
jill greer -- investor relations
thanks, gary. cathy, we're ready for questions from the analysts. if you could give the instructions on how to get in the queue.
",2020-Q4,DAL
0.6691,1.0,,,":
operator
yes ma'am. [operator instructions] our first question comes from duane pfennigwerth of evercore.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks. so i wanted to ask you about restart bottlenecks. as we travel more, it feels like staffing levels are very tight.
and that's just not an airline observation, but really across service providers, hotels, car rentals, it feels like there's understaffing right now relative to demand. and i think there's been some anecdotes about a hard time filling open positions. obviously, the airline industry is in a different position given psp, but i wanted to ask you, as you gain confidence in the demand recovery, what are the bottlenecks in getting spooled back up? are you short-staffed today relative to any of your work groups? or is it really just a pilot training exercise?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, duane, you know, i think the issue you talk about in the broader hospitality sector is an issue -- i don't think it's an issue for the airlines, but i know the hotels, the rental car providers, as you say, are having a difficult time getting staff back, given the level of unemployment and other stimulus that's been provided into the general economy. we're not experiencing that issue at all here at delta. our people have been at work throughout the entire time. i'd say the biggest bottleneck -- two bottlenecks that we face, which i feel very good about where we're at, is clearly getting our pilot training and our pilots into the right categories and ready to fly.
and secondly, maintenance, making certain that we've got our aircraft and our engines and all the work ready for a pretty quick rebound. it's a -- we had some cancellations on easter sunday a couple of weeks ago, about 100 in the business. and we've noticed that's been a trend on some of the holiday weekends. but for the last few holidays, certainly president's day and easter, not nearly the challenges that we experienced earlier in thanksgiving and christmas.
and it's because our business is dealing with the tension between making sure that we've got as many costs out and saved and people on, whether it's voluntary leave or some other alternative plan and being ready to respond to demand as it comes back. i feel pretty good about where we sit for the coming spring and summer. we spent an awful lot of time understanding that. you also need to appreciate that in certain parts of the country, the virus is growing at a faster rate than others.
we've had vaccinations moving, and that's impacted a little bit on the pilot availability because pilots need to sit for a couple of days once they -- every time they get a shot. but all in, i think our team is well-positioned and ready for the rebound that we see coming this summer.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. thanks for that. and then, just for a follow-up, and i think gary touched on it, but how do you think about the range of outcomes on june, whether it's capacity or revenue? what ability do you have here in 2q to flex up if demand plays out better than what your guidance assumes? thanks for taking the questions.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, the biggest flex lever we have is the middle seat, which comes available may 1. and you're gonna see a significant capacity bump from april to may because of the seats. so we're not anticipating a significant amount of schedule -- additional schedule requirements. probably the biggest question mark we have is the international space, and we're working closely with the international authorities to be ready to fly when they enable travel, particularly in the transatlantic markets.
but i'm not contemplating us having a big challenge getting seats in the market for june.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brandon oglenski, barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. gary, you walked through a lot of changes on the balance sheet there, but i think you said you're gonna end the quarter, q2 that is, with about $19 billion to $19.5 billion in net debt. and i guess, could you just talk to, again, the priorities on the fleet and the pension paydown, as well as like where you'd like to see that net debt number by the end of the year and then maybe a longer-term goal around the balance sheet?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, well, brandon, we're not gonna comment on where we'll be by the end of the year. what we've been very clear about as the long-term goal is that we want to be back to an investment-grade quality balance sheet. if you think about it simplistically, our net debt is up about $8.5 billion since the end of 2019. so one easy way to think about what we need to do is get that back down to the $10 billion range.
in terms of near-term priorities, you noted, one, we did make beyond the quarter on april 1, we made a $1 billion contribution to the plan. we've discussed in here the potential for up to another $1 billion to achieve that fully funded ppa status. the other things that you should expect to see from us would be we are gonna continue to pay cash for our aircraft, which not only prevents us from incurring debt, but it, obviously, builds our unencumbered collateral base. and then, we have ongoing debt maturity.
so in this quarter alone, in fact, on monday, we will pay a $600 million unsecured maturity. over the course of the rest of the quarter, we'll have another roughly $250 million of regularly scheduled amortization and another $400 million of that across the second half. so you'll continue to see those debt levels work down for all of those reasons.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
appreciate that. and has the pandemic made you rethink your minimum liquidity threshold that you're comfortable carrying going forward?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
well, we've looked at this a number of different ways. we're thinking about it on an interim basis. we've looked at it a number of ways, and they're all kind of pointing to the same zip code. so we've sketched out about a $10 billion to $12 billion interim floor for liquidity that we want to see.
i think it's important to note, though, that we don't have that thought process in isolation. and i'll just repeat, one of the things that you see us very deliberately doing is consciously building the unencumbered collateral base as we go. so in addition to thinking about where we want to be with liquidity, our mind is also on continuing to build that unencumbered asset base so that we've got the flexibility.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from jamie baker, j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. first question for ed or maybe for glen, i appreciate the endorsement of the third-quarter profit. from a high level, can you expand on what it's going to require? i mean, can you get there solely on domestic leisure recovery? or do you need some percentage of international reopening or corporate to improve from down 80% to down 60%, that sort of thing?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, jamie. obviously, there's still a ways to go between here and there to get to the third quarter. clearly, the no. 1 dependency is the vaccination rate and getting to herd immunity in our country.
and all the experts we talk to, including our own doctors, tell us that early summer is when we should expect our country to be in some form of early herd immunity, and that will continue to inspire additional travel. yes, we're working on reopening international corridors. i think the one that is most likely to be open for the third quarter, hopefully, is the u.s./u.k. travel corridor.
we're spending a lot of time with the authorities, both here in the u.s., as well as the u.k., as to what's going to be required to get that done. and hopefully, early summer, that we'll see that corridor to open, which will then bring some pressure, i'm sure, on other markets to follow similar suit and protocol. the middle-seat opening is another huge leverage point. the fact that we've been carrying such a significant amount of our capacity deliberately not selling, is gonna be a big add-on there.
so when you think about all these factors, you need to think about the additional scale that we have from better utilizing our fleet. our fleet is still somewhat probably 10% to 15% underutilized as we are operating it today. these are the types of things we look at to give us some real optimism that there's a pathway to get into profitability this summer.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. second question for gary, and i suppose this builds a little bit on brandon's question, but you've cited the build in the atl in the release in the prepared remarks. that was helpful. a competitor of yours has said that one of their most important lessons learned from the downturn is you just can't count on the atl anymore.
is that consistent with how you're thinking and how it ties back to how you manage liquidity going forward?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
jamie, there -- i think i'll answer it this way. there are a number of factors that we put into the thought process about liquidity. it is safe to say that that was one of the stress points that we consider. so it's wrapped into the analysis i was describing that has us kind of landing in that $10 million to $12 million zone.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. ok. and i appreciate it. thank you, gentlemen.
i look forward to seeing you next month. it's good to be getting back to in-person.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we look forward to it, jamie.
operator
our next question comes from helane becker, cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks vert much, operator. so two questions. ed, you referenced -- and you and i talked about this last month, too, you refer sustainability and the things that you're doing with respect to carbon sequestration and i think you mentioned other changes in the fleet. and i'm just kind of wondering, how should we think about getting to net carbon zero by 2040 and the costs involved in that? and if you think that that helps your corporate market share going forward?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure, helane. as i mentioned in my opening comments, sustainability is a real issue for us, for our business and it's a problem now. it can't wait until later to be addressed. we're doing, as we've committed to, invest in verified carbon offsets with the highest certification, which are the really -- the only real solution in the marketplace right now.
and we appreciate there's a lot of concerns about efficacies, and we are concerned also, and that's why we're so specific in terms of what we're investing in. but there is real evidence they have a clear impact, and we can't wait for those longer-term investments to start paying off to reduce the footprint in the meantime. we're working with a lot of providers, whether it's in the energy arena or other technology providers seeking solutions to decarbonize our operations and our footprint. we've committed $1 billion over this decade toward investments along these lines.
and as you see, this become an increased importance to the current administration, their priorities, we are hopefully going to get some support from our government, particularly in the area of sustainable aviation fuels, which is critical. we don't have, as an industry, a clear road map to net carbon zero by 2040 at the present time. but it's important that we have the mindset that we're going to do what it takes to continue to invest in a better future for all.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then, just on another subject, when we were down there for investor day in 2019, one of the things that we saw was the delta tech ops and the maintenance operation and so on. and i'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that business going forward, given the huge reduction in older aircraft that exist out there in the world now. and your non-delta customers and how they're thinking about renewing contracts, or whatever and how you're thinking about that business.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, we're excited about the -- sure, helane. we're excited about the mro and its future. and you're right, in 2020, there was a dip in volumes as airlines pull back, not just flying levels but retired on a global basis, some of the older fleets. but our mro revenues are not down nearly in line with what were flying levels have come down to.
and as we look to the pipeline of opportunities, there's still a pretty good backlog to dip into. so the team is doing a great job over there, first and foremost, taking care of the delta fleet. but looking for opportunities to expand going forward. and i think as the earlier question that duane answered -- or asked around pipeline blockages or obstacles to getting our businesses back, the mro is going to be key for us, not just helping delta, but also helping some other airlines around the world get their businesses back up and running as quickly as they can.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

our next question comes from hunter keay, wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everybody. with so much liquidity in demand and trading, has there been 0% probability, ed, you do not participate in psp 3?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry, hunter, you said with the liquidity -- let me rephrase, the liquidity we have, will we be participating in psp 3? is that your fundamental question?
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
i guess, yeah, i'm just wondering if there's a chance that you turn down psp 3, if things continue to improve like this, or opt not to participate in it?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah, no, we don't anticipate turning that down now. no.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, thank you. and then, glen, as you talk to the corporates, i know it's early, but as you think about 2022 spending, are you starting these conversations from 2019 spend and working it down? or are you starting at zero and sort of building it up?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah. i think we're looking at what we have today and building it back up again. and we don't know the outcome or when. what we do see is that slow and steady build, and we think as we get to the end of the summer, as we said in the script, as the vaccination rates continue to improve and offices continue to return, that we will see an acceleration as we head into the fall.
and i think still unknown where we'll wind up this year and where we'll wind up in summer of '22, and that's, i think, where we are gonna work on the flexibility of our fleet to flex up or down depending on what we see in the market at different points in time.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
to add to glen's points, we did update the corporate survey that we commented upon last quarter. and the numbers continue to look favorable, 36% of -- and this is many of our large corporations participated, 36% expect to be fully back travel to pre-covid levels by '22 and another 16% by '23. so 52% say they're anticipating getting back to full levels. only 8% of the corporations that we survey say that we'll never get back to pre-covid levels.
and there's 40% that are unclear as to what level of additional flying that we -- that they anticipate. so if you take a fairly conservative view on the 40% uncertain and the 8% that never get fully back and say that only 50% of that returns, then we're looking at 75%, 70% -- yes, 75% to 80% of our corporate revenues coming back over the course of the next couple of years, which i continue to think is conservative, and we're working hard as people feel confident, getting back out into the sky to get business volume back to where it was.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst

our next question comes from ravi shanker, morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. two questions from me, one near term and one longer term. in the near term, how would you characterize the current competitive environment out there? obviously, early days yet and everyone's trying to, obviously, add capacity to a place that people want to go.
but are you encouraged by what you're seeing right now? and do you think it gets better or worse from here as we open up more?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think there's really two things that we would talk about and there are different scenarios. one is internationally, coming out of the pandemic, i think we see a vastly improved competitive scenario with a lot of the ultra-low-cost or low-cost players in each region coming out of this much weaker or gone. and so as we see europe come back, as we see latin and the pacific come back, i think we're going to see a much improved environment for many years ahead of us. and domestically, i think you've characterized it quite well as people are traveling differently than they were pre-pandemic.
and while we are back at 85% of demand, that 85% is going different places than it was prepandemic. so you see a lot more capacity from the industry in places that people are interested, basically the less, the white open spaces, the florida markets, the latin leisure markets. and so we've put our capacity where people want to fly. and i think that's where we'll continue to focus.
and i see, ultimately, i can't tell you what our competitors are gonna do with capacity, but i think we feel really comfortable about how the u.s. arena is developing.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and just looking a little longer term, i don't know how much of your time is spent thinking about 2022 and even 2023 at this point. but look, everyone is looking at 2019 as a baseline, but given the huge pent-up demand and the huge amount of excess savings with the consumer, do you think there's a likelihood that we significantly surpassed 2019 levels of travel in '22, '23 and beyond? and if so, do you have the ability to service that without bringing on significantly more resources?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, ravi. i wish i had a crystal ball that was that clear to know with some degree of confidence. certainly, there's an enormous pent-up demand. consumers have built up a lot of wealth over the pandemic.
people have really lost the connection that they look to recreate and get back together, whether that's for leisure purpose or business. and i think over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we are going to see a strong surge as markets reopen for different categories, as well as different quarters. looking out into the next couple of years, does that mean we'll be beyond 2019? i think it's possible. we have flex in our fleet and our order book to address that.
we're not going to be limited. if there's demand out there, we're gonna be positioned to be able to service.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from savi syth, raymond james.
unknown speaker
hey, good morning. this is actually matt on for savi. thanks for the time. a couple of quick ones for me.
we're just on the international topic. in terms of leveraging your international partners, how do you plan on positioning your domestic network for that? are there any changes necessary or priorities to your coastal hubs?
glen hauenstein -- president
you know, i think one of the things we're excited about as we come out of this pandemic is the strength of our international partners. as i mentioned earlier, international has taken much more of a reshape than domestic, given the fact that a lot of international carriers didn't receive government support through the pandemic and are going to either be much smaller or not be there as the pandemic way eases off. and so we are very encouraged about continuing to leverage our partner hubs as the first wave of prepandemic international travel comes back. and that's really what we've done so far.
and i think, yes, there will be opportunities for us to reshape our domestic to better feed our internationals coming out of this than we had going in. but we'll deal with that as it occurs as opposed to anticipating it.
unknown speaker
got you. and then, one quick one on the fleet. the fuel efficiency is impressive. it seems like that's taking a hold well, but do you expect that kind of level to hold when you're back to full utilization?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, well, as we said, about half of the 12% improvement that you saw in the quarter versus '19 is really structural change, driven by the fleet renewal that we've been talking about. so you can think of the remainder as conditional on where we are on the system. we did say, however, that as we look into the second quarter, we expect at least a 10% improvement on where we were for the same metric in 2019. so do expect continued fuel efficiency certainly through the june quarter of significance.
unknown speaker
thanks for the clarification.

next question comes from andrew didora, bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. glen, just curious on your booking curve commentary in terms of how it continues to lengthen. is there -- are there any data points you can put around this? maybe how much of your 2q budgeted revenues are already on the books versus how that typically compares to normal times or anything you can help quantify that for us?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, through the pandemic, the booking curve is compressed. and starting about middle of last month, for the first time ever, we saw advanced bookings outside of the 60-day window is actually surpassing the percentage of bookings that were in that category in '19. so hopefully, i can give you some context that people are feeling much more comfortable booking further out in the curve. and i think we are looking at several things.
one is, i think in the u.s., they're feeling much more comfortable in domestic flying, knowing they'll get their shots, knowing they'll be able to travel. still waiting for more and more events to open and places to open and be kind of one of the things that continues to accelerate the domestic demand and then really waiting for the internationals to reopen in earnest. i think people are now looking at the fall and making some speculative bookings that europe will be open in the fall. they're not a great number of those out there yet, but certainly, there's interest out there.
and i do believe that in the next month or two, we'll see at least some of the european countries attempting to reopen, and that will hopefully put pressure on the others to figure out ways to reopen their markets.
andrew didora -- bank of merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. makes sense. and then, my second question here just for ed. i guess, more bigger picture here.
we're, obviously, coming out of the pandemic after past downturns, that meaningfully affected the industry. there have been some pretty big changes out there, right? but this time around, we really haven't seen that. there's plenty of liquidity, airlines survive, no consolidation, no hub closures. has any of this surprised you? and why do you think a lot of these have not happened this time around?
glen hauenstein -- president
sure, andrew. no, it doesn't surprise me at all, and it's primarily because of the government support that the u.s. airlines have received in terms of psp. when you think about the significant levels of support in ensuring that that support goes to retaining employment across the industry as a national priority, there really isn't a lot of change, structural, that you use that money to try to get your business back up, which was what they were intended to do.
certainly, on an international level, you're seeing a lot of change. there's been a lot of international restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, changes, which i don't think we really fully appreciate the full extent of that. it's going to take some time yet to play out. i think it will help and benefit the u.s.
industry because we are going to be competitively stronger than in the international landscape than we were previously. so we'll see how that plays out.
andrew didora -- bank of merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from mike linenberg, deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning. everyone. just two here, the first one to glen. glen, have you come up with an estimate of what you think the net revenue hit that you incurred because of the middle seat block? and i would be most focused on the month of march where you actually had pretty good demand, and we're probably spilling traffic.
glen hauenstein -- president
yes, we've looked at that, and i think maybe for the month of march, in particular, and clearly, as we got to the end of -- or as the traffic continues to rise, it got to be -- and confidence return, it got to be a more expensive proposition. so for the month of march, it was probably between $100 million and $150 million of gross revenue that we left on the table not blocking the middle seat, but really ensuring that demand came back and ensuring that our brand came out of this very strong. and i think had we had the choice to do it over again, we would do it in a heartbeat because i think it's something that really sets delta apart through this pandemic is putting consumer confidence and the confidence in health and safety first was a very important part of how we've invested in our brands through this pandemic. so i think that's when we see this real confidence returning in the april-may time period.
that was also one of our big cues to say it is time to let that go away.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for the color there. and then, just my second question to gary, on the $1.85 to $1.95 fuel guide, is there an embedded refinery loss in there? what is it, if there is on a per-gallon basis? and sort of a part 2 to that, as i recall, i believe the voluntary participation in the corsia program was supposed to commence, i believe, in 2021. in fact, is that true? and where is that going to show up on the delta p&l if, in fact, that does kick in this year? thank you.
peter carter -- executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary
good morning. it's peter carter. so from the corsia perspective, this is the year where we benchmark. so this is the year where our use will be determined for future years.
and it is completely voluntary. but of course, we are fully participating.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, and mike, on the first part of your question, the $1.85 to $1.95, it does contemplate a loss at the refinery. it's not as substantial as what we experienced in the first quarter. the fuel curve that we're using is generally what you see out there, crude in the low $60s and cracks in the $5 to $6 range.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
right. very helpful. thanks. thanks, both.
thanks, everyone.
operator
our next question comes from david vernon, bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning, guys. a couple of questions for you on the contours of the revenue environment. if we look at kind of where average fares are sort of trending based on some of the arc data and other sources out there, it looks like the average fare level is lower than we were in 2019. can you talk to how much of that is sort of mix and loss of business travel demand? and what maybe a like-for-like leisure yield would look like today versus 2019?
glen hauenstein -- president
maybe i'll take a stab at that, is -- and give you a little bit of a forward look is we have, clearly, in the month of may, we're calling may a transition month because we are putting the middle seats back in, which gives us a substantial increase in our capacity levels. and we're expecting that may will come in with an absolute load factor of 75%. as we get into june and the more peak travel season and with those seats being absorbed into the marketplace, we believe that we will move from the 70s into the mid-80s. that gives us a little bit of an opportunity to start to manage yield a little bit more than we have in the past.
and so structurally, we think we are in a pretty good space in terms of the structure of leisure, travel and fares being within the range of where we were in 2019. and so as we head into the summer, we believe that the real pressure on domestic yields will come primarily from the lack of business travel, not from the structure themselves or not for leisure travelers paying significantly less than they did in '19. does that help answer your question?
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
it does. i guess. and maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about getting the yield management sort of levers to work in the revenue optimization systems, how long do you think -- from a domestic standpoint, like when do you think you'll actually be at a level where you're not just starting that process, but you're kind of more at a run rate of getting that full benefit of managing your deals?
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, remember that the way the yield curve works is we're always saving for the last-minute business traveler, whose -- there are not that many of them out there this year, or they're substantially less than they were for 2019. so you won't see, i think, the full impact of yield management flow into the revenue equation until a little bit later, probably early fall. so summer is going to be about managing leisure demand, and there's a little less opportunity in terms of saving that last seat for the business customer.
so as we move through the year, i think we're going to get, say, september, october to really be in a much better position to manage yield through the traditional rm systems.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from catherine o'brien, goldman sachs.
catie o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
morning. thanks so much for the time. so a little bit of a shorter-term take on ravi's question earlier. regarding your plans to get to 75% of 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter, is that the structural maximum based on your fleet and crew retirements? and if we do see that wave of pent-up demand, you discussed on your cnbc interview this morning, ed, would you consider sourcing additional aircraft to be able to add more capacity back sooner? or is that capacity plan that's really in line with your views on the pace of the recovery through year-end? i realized, a couple of questions in there.
thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
thanks, catie. we certainly have, in the very near term for this coming summer, limitations to how much demand we can serve. and it's -- there's decisions that are taken six to 12 months in advance in terms of getting pilots into the right categories. that said, with the significant amount of capacity we're adding through the middle seat being returned to service, i don't think it's going to be a substantial impact on our ability to serve the demand that we see out there.
catie o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then, maybe one on the cost outlook. you previously announced expectation that the company can achieve 2019 casm on just 75% of 2019 asm. i guess, first, is that still the expectation? and then, second, is inflation contemplated in that figure? or is that a like-for-like figure, assuming 2019 labor maintenance costs and the like that typically do see some annual inflation? thank you.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
catie, that's a number that we expect to hit this year. and i would say, i'm really pleased with where we are. i mean, we are on the trajectory. the 6% to 9%, as i mentioned, that we are achieving in the second quarter.
i mentioned the four points of rebuild that are included in there. but you heard glen talk about some of the international flying that we're not doing now. our international mix is down quite a bit. in particular, we're not flying a lot of the long-haul international network yet.
if you look like-for-like and what you're seeing in the second quarter, that's also about a five-point headwind. so kudos to the team here. everybody has really embraced it, and they've just done a great job. the whole company, really, has come together around it.
as i mentioned, in 2020, it was really about aggressively attacking the cost base. we understand the mission this year is really getting that incremental leverage as the network rebuilds, and you're really seeing it in the second quarter. if you take a look at how the asms are coming on and the cost incurred to do that, it's really nice operating leverage. so very happy with where we are and fully expect to be on that 2019 number by the time we hit the fourth quarter.
catie o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
catie, one other thing i'd like to add to the point. people probably don't appreciate the fact that for the last couple of quarters, delta has actually been flying the most scheduled service of anyone out there. so when people worry whether we're going to have the capacity and the seats in the market to fill it. we're flying more scheduled service because we are blocking so many of the seats on the individual airplanes.
as we open that inventory up, we're going to be rate with anybody in terms of being able to provide service and strength into some of our key hubs and markets domestically. so we're not concerned in the short term that we're going to be short of aircraft or short of staff.
catie o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for the additional color.
operator
and our next question comes from sheila kahyaoglu, jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, everyone, and thank you. i guess, somewhat related to the last question, how are you thinking about international markets coming back up here, the relatively upbeat guidance on international capacity for summer 2021? how are you thinking about that in terms of, geographically, are you seeing any dispersion and bookings so far?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, on the reopening of international borders, i think there's still more -- many more questions than our answers. we are focused on trying to get the u.s./u.k. travel corridor open. i think that's the most logical has the greatest value to us.
and i think those are the markets where we'll start to see demand grow quickly when we can get that open, and we are working with our partners emerging from the u.k. standpoint, as well as across not just the airline industry, but within the broader travel and hospitality sector to figure out how we can get it open for summer. and we're making progress in that regard. when you think about other parts of europe, there may be some occasional markets open this summer based on southern mediterranean leisure traffic that people will be interested in.
but i don't think you're going to see continental europe opened in any meaningful way till later in the year. we'll probably unfortunately miss much of the summer for most of continental europe. on the other end extreme, i think asia is going to be the long pole in the tent. i think that could take a year or more to start travel back up at scale.
when you think about china and japan and many of the other pacific markets. the one market that we will be spending a lot of time trying to support is korea with our partner at korean. and south america is going to be somewhere in the middle. it's really going to be based on the success they have in trying to get the virus under containment in their countries, which we all know, right now, is a very difficult spot that they sit in.
so that's probably late this year into the winter when you'll start to see south america open up.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you for that color. and then, how should we think about progression of yields, particularly given that you guys have been successful in doing so? you mentioned summer is all about leisure and limited capacity. so how are you thinking about that progression on yield?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think we're really focused on the unit revenues, and i think we outlined the progression. and of course, there's a yield traffic trade-off that we're always monitoring. but when you think about getting 20 to 25 points of unit revenues sequentially between the end of march and june. that's a huge improvement, and one that i think is indicative of what we'll be looking at for summer travel.
and i outlined earlier, we think that the traffic will be in the mid-80s for peak summer domestic. and that presents opportunity to manage yield.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst

our next question comes from joseph denardi, stifel.
joe denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for squeezing me in. maybe ed or gary, just looking at the fleet pre-covid you guys had talked about nma as an option for 757 replacement. i'm wondering if that's still the thinking or maybe kind of what the updated thoughts are with that? are there new options kind of out there on the used aircraft side that changes the approach? or how are you all thinking about that? maybe kind of when do you need to order something to -- for that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
joe, it's ed. as you probably have seen or read, the nma is not being actively discussed at boeing at the present time, but they certainly do have alternatives and new designs that they're thinking about, and we're engaged with those conversations. nothing imminent or on the short horizon here, but we are looking at the longer-term opportunities with our friends in seattle.
joe denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then, you talked about march co-brand spend being up versus 2019. seems very bullish to me. can you talk about the longer-term target and your ability to get to the $7 billion that you talked about pre-covid? can you do better? and then, specifically, how sensitive is that to corporate demand or not? it would seem more tied to leisure, but just interested in your thoughts there.
thank you.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
so clearly, the co-branded cards are an array of purpose, including a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises, where we are seeing a lot of success with the cards right now. and so i think we feel very, very confident that we can get to the $7 billion. and clearly, the crisis has put a little delay on that, and we're sizing up how significant that delay is and how we can shorten that delay by new and innovative programs to stimulate demand for the card. and i think we feel confident coming out of this, that the card performed at or above our expectations of how it would do in a scenario -- a recessionary scenario.
and so we think a very bright future for that card.
joe denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

operator
our next question comes from myles walton from ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. ed, maybe a reflective question. given the level of government support and assistance, the u.s.
airline industry has gotten in the last 12 months, does it reframe how you and others in the u.s. will look at subsidization of international carriers that was clearly a complaint precrisis? and is there a potential for almost a turning of the tables as they look at us and the level of support we've gotten in the u.s.?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
that's an interesting question, myles. and certainly, we've depended upon the support from our government here to be able to sustain an essential service for our economy. i don't know what that means in terms of long term. clearly, the middle eastern subsidies were not there as a support tool for essential service.
they were there to grow their economies and grow their businesses. so i think fundamentally, the nature of the intervention, not just in the u.s. but around the world that we've seen over the last year, is of a very different character. and we'll see on the other end of this, where the international markets land and the level of subsidies that continues.
so yes, we've been appreciative of that but no, i don't think it changes the character of what our issues were in the past.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then, maybe, glen, the shape of the quarter in june. obviously, 1q was january, february versus march. is may -- april, may, june more linear in the recovery profile?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, clearly, the big step-up is from april to may as the seats get released, and then june is just sequentially better. so more of a traditional seasonality moving from may to june. and really, it's about the capacity absorption of that middle seat is the story of the second quarter. clearly, in the first few weeks of that, it will -- people have to leave to come back, so there will be some imbalances.
and so we see the first two weeks of may being a little bit lighter and then the second two weeks, as you get into memorial day and the more traditional peak leisure period, which should be much stronger.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations

[operator instructions] our first question comes from leslie josephs, cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
on the pilot training issues, how much of that is contributing to your cost? same question for the maintenance issues you've discussed before, kind of the ramping up. and do you expect to hire pilots at all this year?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i think, leslie, we mentioned that in the cost guidance for the second quarter, the rebuild, the maintenance, as well as some training is probably in the three- to four-point range of the 6% to 9% growth that we're seeing over 2019 levels. so it's a meaningful amount that we are investing to get the business back. we've not made a decision yet with respect to hiring. but i do anticipate, if we see the recovery continue to gain strength, that before the end of the year, we could very well be in the market for both pilot and flight attendant hiring again.

glen hauenstein -- president
you know, we haven't encountered that yet. so we've been able to fly schedules that we wanted to fly to all those leisure destinations.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- reporter
got it. and i guess, i'm curious if you're thinking about or planning to do any more point-to-point flying -- flights that overfly some of your hubs as some of your competitors have. is that something that you're looking at ramping up for the summer?

you know, we have a very, very strong performance from our core hubs and our coastal gateway. so we're going to stay focused on them.

your next question comes from mary schlangenstein, bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
thank you very much. we saw southwest yesterday increased the number of rapid reward points, but it's going to take to redeem an award. they increased by about 6%. i'm wondering if you can comment at all on whether that's something that delta might be considering or we might see you do down the road here?
glen hauenstein -- president
no, we're not considering that. and we're very excited about the value we're bringing to customers through our program. and we've actually used the program to stimulate a lot of demand with really some very attractive offers that we've had in market across the u.s. and hopefully, our frequent fliers are enjoying the benefits associated with those attractive offers.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
and can you talk about how you've seen the buildup point? i mean, very few people are traveling, especially internationally, as we all know. but what did you see keep up your level of points being built? was it credit card use? did that surpass travel? or can you comment on that at all?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, if you think about it, unfortunately, there weren't very many people traveling on the airline, which is about majority of the points that we issue. and on the credit card side, clearly, that had a much more sustained. so we don't feel that there's a huge imbalance coming out of the pandemic, but the difference between what points have been crude versus what we anticipate being able to supply in the marketplace. and we're pretty excited about people returning to use their points.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from david slotnick, tpg.
david slotnick -- the points guy -- senior aviation business reporter
good morning. thanks for the call question. i want to go back to what we were talking about before. as you pointed out, the likelihood of the u.k./u.s.
tunnel is seemingly growing. just curious if you can shed some light on what kind of demand you're expecting there, and how you would plan to capture that demand, especially if it's a last minute reopening kind of thing without being -- having aircraft and crews overcommitted to some of the domestic and regional leisure markets?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, clearly, what we've seen is when customers can travel internationally, they are willing to and excited about it. and i think when you think about the places that you can go today, whether or not it's the caribbean or the latin, we have said that there's more than 100% of the demand restored to those places. so we are over-indexing already versus where we were in 2019. so as those open, we will be able to supply.
and as you think about it, there's still a significant number of our places that will be closed. so if the u.k. were to open, we'd be able to satisfy as many seats as people needed to fill the demand. i think we're excited about that, and we'll see how it goes.
but one thing i would have a takeaway is americans want to travel and they want to travel abroad.
operator
our next question comes from robert silk, travel weekly.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
yes. hi. where is delta at as far as digital health passport development? and also, do you all see that -- how much impact do you see digital health passports as being able to have, particularly when you talk about on a global scale, interoperably across nations versus simply the vaccines and the end of the pandemic being really what brings back international demand?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
so we're spending a considerable amount of time building an open source platform. because as you probably know, there's a lot of different marketing technologies for digital health credentials, which i think is probably the more appropriate versus passport, which gains a lot of negativity, calling them passports. the challenge we face is every government around the world is looking at their questions uniquely, and we need to start looking collectively at answer. so that will be important, for example, as we reopened the u.s./u.k.
border as to what technology will be available to actually evidence vaccination, if indeed the regulators even require a vaccination. it's not clear that that's been -- that that's even going to be a requirement. so we're working to try to keep as open a framework as possible, working with health providers, technology providers and our customers to ensure that when they need to show that they've been vaccinated or have been tested, they can do it in as efficient manner as possible.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor for aviation
thanks.

our next question comes from john biers, afp. john, your live is live. if your phone is on mute, please unmute.
john biers -- agence france-presse -- business correspondent
thank you. hi. john biers at agence france-presse. i wanted to ask, there was the whole controversy about the georgia election law, and there was a -- briefly, there was a boycott delta hashtag that went viral and so forth.
and you came out strongly against the law after it passed. i wondered if you had seen any impact on -- from customers, either positive or negative in this period? if you could discuss whether you think there'll be any lasting impact on your brand with the public.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
no, we haven't seen any significant impact from the different discussions that have been going on in the -- in georgia.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
with that, travis, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to ed for his closing comments, please.
operator
yes, sir. our next question comes from elliott blackburn, argus media.
elliott blackburn -- argus media -- senior reporter
good morning. thanks for making time for me. i just hope you could talk a little bit about -- especially in light of delta's decarbonization goals, how does the trainer refinery fit into delta? and how do you -- how are you guys looking at that facility going forward now?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
well, it fits in, as it always has. it's an offset to our exposure to jet cracks. and that's one of the things that we are saying. we had some questions about impact at the refinery and one of the primary drivers of that, there are two.
but the first primary driver is just the fact that jet cracks right now are very low. i mentioned they were in the $5 to $6 range. we've seen them historically in the $15 to $20 range. the other contributor to the near-term performance has just been a huge escalation in the cost of rins, which have gone toward the end of the fourth quarter, they were in the $0.60 to $0.70 range, and they're well north of $1 now.
that's a market dislocation that we just don't see as sustainable.
elliott blackburn -- argus media -- senior reporter
i think given that, i mean, especially with the rin uncertainty and also with your interest in saf, i mean, are you guys looking at possibly converting that refinery to renewables? or would you change operations at that refinery going forward?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
look, i think it's safe to say we're always evaluating all our options. what we're not going to do, though, is let some of these short-term dislocations guide our actions. this is an asset that has contributed a lot to the company over the last -- in the time that we've owned it, which is the better part of the last decade. we've got a world-class team there operating it -- they're operating it safely.
they're operating it efficiently. they're operating it cost effectively. and as i mentioned, it is serving the purpose that we've always had for it, which is an offset to the crack exposure that we have.
elliott blackburn -- argus media -- senior reporter
thanks very much.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
with that, we'll turn it over to ed for final closing comments. so thank you, everybody, for your participation today.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes. so i'd like to thank you all for your participation and joining us this morning. as we sum up the call, it's clear that at delta, we've reached an important inflection point as we navigate the pandemic and move into the recovery phase of 2021. as the pace of vaccinations accelerate, our customers are reclaiming their lives, air travel will be central as people reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues replacing their screens with real human touch points as they venture out of their homes and communities to experience the world again.
looking forward, with customer demand steadily rising, there is a lot of runway ahead of us as we open our middle seats to booking and corporate and international begin to recover in earnest. and once the recovery of those segments are under way, we expect they'll prove to be a powerful cash and profitability lever to get our business back to where we need it to be. the strength of our balance sheet has been critical, and i'm excited that we are shifting our focus to delevering, which will also be an important accelerator in our recovery. so with all of this, i have great confidence that delta is well-positioned to lead the industry in the months and years ahead.
i thank all of the people at delta for your tremendous job, particularly over these last 12 months in positioning us for success, and we look forward to welcoming all of you back aboard our flights in the days and months to come. thank you, all.

good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines march quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is travis, and i will be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead, ma'am.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, travis. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our march quarter 2021 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today are our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; and our interim co-cfo, gary chase. ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy.
glen will provide an update on the revenue environment; and gary will discuss costs, fleet and our balance sheet. similar to last quarter's call, we've scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. [operator instructions] today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thank you, julie. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. it's been a little over a year since the onset of the pandemic, and our customers are gaining confidence in air travel and beginning to reclaim their lives.
reflecting on what it's been in a year like no other, i'm tremendously proud of the progress that we've made and the agility that we've demonstrated. i've developed an even deeper appreciation for delta's strength and firmly believe that the pandemic has served as a catalyst for us to find new and better ways to serve our customers and our communities. thanks to the incredible dedication and sacrifices of our people, delta has weathered the storm with our culture, our brand and our values stronger than ever before. and i want to thank every member of the delta family for your incredible efforts over the past year.
collectively, you've carried us through and shown that unique spirit that we call the delta difference. i also want to thank the administration and congress for continued payroll support, which has protected thousands of airline jobs throughout the industry and will help speed the u.s. economy in the recovery. thanks to that support, we've been able to return our people to full work schedules despite running an operation that will be at 65% to 70% of 2019 levels in the june quarter.
the first quarter had two distinct periods, with the first half feeling very much like an extension of 2020 as demand was slower than expected. but as case counts decline and vaccinations accelerated, demand picked up meaningfully later in the quarter, allowing us to achieve $4 million of daily positive cash generation in the month of march, the first positive cash generation since the onset of covid-19. this marks a critical milestone in the path to restoring our financials. it is truly a great accomplishment, especially considering that our middle seat block limited the inventory that we're selling, and business and international travel remain muted.
it's also important to note that this metric takes into account all expenses that we're incurring as we rebuild our business. to have turned a true net positive cash flow position within a year of the biggest crisis ever seen in the history of this industry is a real testament to the resilience of the company that we have built. consumer confidence in air travel continues to increase with the pace of vaccinations in the u.s. rapidly accelerating and predictions of herd immunity as soon as this summer.
we said throughout the pandemic that one of the most important objectives was to restore confidence in air travel. we are now seeing more normal booking behavior as customers make plans for spring and summer travel. in fact, our daily net cash sales in march were twice what they were in january. as volumes grow, keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy will always be our top priority.
we've taken a science-based approach to cleanliness and are being guided by our own chief health officer dr. henry ting, as well as by medical experts at the mayo clinic and emory. and earlier this month, the cdc confirmed that it is safe to travel within the u.s. for those who have been fully vaccinated, an important step forward for the recovery of our industry.
we are aligning with the recommendations of health professionals and government officials who continue to ensure the safe and effective distribution of vaccines, and listening to our customers. based on our survey work, 75% of our customers expect to be vaccinated by memorial day. with the improving demand in vaccine trends, we announced that we'll start selling middle seats may 1, providing a powerful tool for improving our financial performance. we also launched other customer experience and loyalty enhancements to increase confidence in travel and maintain the trust and loyalty that we've built over the last 12 months.
looking ahead and assuming that these recovery trends hold, we expect to cut our pre-tax loss by more than half in the june quarter to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, and we see a path to returning to profitability in the september quarter. delta's resilience has helped us navigate the worst days of the pandemic, driven by the competitive advantages that are core to our dna. those advantages: our people; our brand and loyalty program; our reliable operations; our network and our balance sheet will be even more important as we accelerate through the phases of recovery. these moats were tested like never before, and i'm proud of the resilience that they've demonstrated.
our people and our culture of service remain our most strategic asset. loyalty to the delta brand has never been stronger, thanks to the outstanding service that our people provide. they are truly the best professionals in the business. this is evident in our domestic customer net promoter scores, which have been in the low 70s throughout the pandemic, a full 20-point increase over 2019.
we've also seen our customers continue to invest in the delta brand using their american express co-brand cards, demonstrating the resiliency of this unique revenue stream. despite a large reduction in t&e categories, march co-brand spend on the card, overall, was up relative to march 2019 levels. our operational performance remained strong. during the quarter, we led the industry in all on-time metrics, including a0, d0 and completion factor, which was more than 99%.
and our network rebuild leverages the strength of our core hub structure in our international partner gateways. at the same time, we are renewing and simplifying our fleet, improving the customer experience, driving efficiency and reducing emissions as we push toward our carbon-neutral goals. and finally, the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our history with no dilution to our shareholders other than warrants related to the payroll support program, is something that continues to set us apart in the industry. we've begun our journey of delevering.
and by the end of the june quarter, we will have reduced financial obligations by nearly $10 billion through a combination of paying down debt and accelerating pension funding since last fall. this reflects an unprecedented turnaround in the health of our pensions over the last decade, securing the future of our retirees. later this year, we expect to make one final contribution to the plan of up to $1 billion, which should enable our pension to reach fully funded ppa status by the end of this year, largely mitigating the need for any additional cash contributions going forward. and finally, as we look toward the future, it's important to acknowledge that the commitment we made last year to achieving carbon neutrality is as strong as ever.
the only future for delta and our industry is a sustainable future. this is why we're accelerating our fleet renewal and balancing near-term needs for verifiable offsets with long-term investments in sustainable aviation fuels, carbon sequestration advancements and clean propulsion technology. and because we can't do this alone, we are collaborating with corporate customers, as well as large energy producers in order to address aviation emissions together and work to scale up sustainable aviation fuels. we're excited about the progress that we're making to combat climate change and enable a cleaner, more sustainable world.
these steps are vital to delta's long-term future and we owe it to the next generation of customers and employees to continue down this path. the time for acting, not talk, is now, and i'm proud of the steps our team is taking. as the recovery takes hold, glimmers of hope are now optimism for the future. demand for air travel is accelerating in a meaningful way and we are well-positioned to build a stronger delta as demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels in the next few years.
with our competitive advantages having been fully tested, we have built a platform to extend delta's leadership position in the years to come. more than ever, i am confident in the future of delta and our people. over the last year, we've taken meaningful actions to become a better, more sustainable, more inclusive company, driven by our mission to connect the world. and with that, i'll turn it over to glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
thanks, ed, and good morning, everyone. as ed mentioned, the pace of demand recovery accelerated over the course of the quarter. with growing confidence, customers are now buying tickets for travel further out, speeding our cash recovery. in the month of march, daily new bookings improved 50% from the january and february average, well ahead of its normal seasonality.
as customers are now buying tickets for travel further out, our booking curve has extended and our air traffic liability has grown for the first time in three quarters, up more than $800 million from december. on our january call, i outlined three distinct phases to the year and our levers for each. to progress to the second phase, we need to see higher vaccination rates, easing travel advisories and growing consumer confidence, all of which are now evident in the united states today. approximately 50% of the adult population in the u.s.
have now received at least one dose of the vaccine and by may, all states will have lifted mandatory domestic quarantine restrictions. pent-up demand is also evident, with domestic leisure bookings 85% recovered to 2019 levels and leisure markets more than fully restored. beyond our own bookings, we see encouraging data points in the broader economy. this includes accumulated savings, restaurant dining, credit card spend, hotel occupancy rates, web search data on travel and corporations announcing more concrete office reopening plans.
in response to these developments and the reduction of covid-19 cases, as well as accelerated vaccination rates, we will sunset our middle seat block as of may 1. that provides us with a very powerful lever to add capacity in a cost-efficient way and generate meaningful margin tailwind. removing our middle seat block results in our sellable capacity increasing from 46% of 2019 levels for the month of april to 67% of 2019 levels for the month of june. and with this increase, coinciding with strong customer demand for our product, we expect our passenger unit revenue to improve by 20 to 25 points over that period.
with this added capacity and a continuation of the leisure recovery heading into peak season, we expect our june quarter revenues to improve by approximately $2 billion from the march quarter. the corporate travel recovery has been slow but steady. corporate volumes in march were nearly 20% recovered, up from 15% at the end of 2020. small and medium enterprises continued to outperform other corporates by about five points.
and given our investments in the customer experience, we've been able to grow our domestic corporate share lead, which is now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. to progress to the next leg of the recovery, we need corporate travel to return in earnest. while we expect continued improvements to business travel through the summer, we anticipate the significant increases will occur after labor day as we enter the more traditional business travel season. that will happen as vaccinations become even more widespread and offices continue to reopen.
we continue to expect operational and sales-related travel to lead, with travel to large conferences and internal meetings likely the last to recover. our views on corporate demand recovery are consistent with what we've heard in our most recent quarterly corporate survey, where one-third of our accounts expect to increase travel volume in the june quarter and a majority of our corporate customers expect to return to office in the second half of the year. vaccine distribution and lifting of government travel restrictions remain the top two drivers of corporate willingness to travel. international travel remains muted with long-haul international booking volumes at only 15% to 25% recovered.
we're seeing some early signs of life in europe, with iceland opening to travel to vaccinated u.s. citizens and increased demand for israel and leisure destinations this fall. that said, europe lags the u.s. and pacific is expected to be the last region to recover.
we do not anticipate meaningful international demand improvement until later in the year when borders reopen. once the recovery of those segments are under way, we'll expect they also prove to be a powerful cash and profitability lever for our business. considering our operating leverage improvements in those segments will be cost-effective and highly margin-accretive, a dynamic that is very similar to what we expect from lifting our middle seat blocks and one that i'm very enthusiastic about. in the meantime, we'll continue to benefit from the strengthening demand environment in the domestic and short-haul latin regions and from our non-ticket revenue streams, which have proven more resilient.
our cargo revenues in the march quarter improved 5% sequentially and were up 12% versus the march quarter of 2019. the performance of our loyalty is indicative of delta's strong brand affinity and our customer aspirations to return to travel. as ed mentioned, co-brand spend in the month of march was higher than 2019 levels. this was a result of solid growth in non-t&e spend and continued momentum in t&a, which is now down 35% in march from down approximately 55% in november -- in december, i'm sorry.
card acquisitions are also rebounding nicely, and our attrition rates are below pre-pandemic levels. for the month of march, co-brand acquisitions were over 60% recovered with less than half of our customer base line. our long-term partnership with american express combines two strong consumer brands, enhancing customer loyalty while also providing a higher-margin revenue stream that has proven its resiliency. we have driven stronger engagement through our digital channels, resulting in more direct relationships with our customers and record-high digital satisfaction scores.
over the last year, we've created a more flexible and enhanced experience for our direct channels, increasing self-service and making it easier for our customers to do business with delta. digital adoption is on the rise, and direct channels like delta.com and the fly delta app account for 66% of our sales in the march quarter, up 15 points from 2019. while we expect that will normalize, especially as corporate travel recovers, direct channels will continue to be preferred, particularly among medallions and young customers. as we restore our business, we're rebuilding our industry-leading network with a simpler, younger and more fuel-efficient fleet.
at the same time, we have preserved optionality with levers to flex our capacity restoration in either direction, depending on the shape of the recovery. we are also capitalizing on the industry's best domestic hub structure with the highest return profile. the combination of our strong core hubs and coastal positions provides us with a unique opportunity to leverage cost-efficient gauge with large narrow-body aircraft, providing meaningful efficiency and scale advantages. in addition, we now see the opportunity to significantly improve our international returns from pre-pandemic levels, driven by an improved competitive position, a stronger cargo business, the acceleration of our fleet renewal, stronger partnerships and an improved product offering.
reflecting on what has been the most difficult 12 months in the company's history, i could not be prouder of what our teams have accomplished. so i want to thank them for their commitment and continue to put the customer in the center of what we do every day. looking forward, i'm optimistic about delta's bright future. we have a powerful brand, loyalty program that's proven their resiliency.
we continue to improve our customer experience, both in the air and on the ground as we've accelerated our robust array of airport projects. our focus on health and flexibility has won the confidence of our travelers and we're being well served by our younger, more eco-friendly fleet and leaner cost structure. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to gary.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
thanks, glen, and good morning, everyone. i'm excited to see our recovery begin to take root and our focus shift from stabilizing the company's financials to creating value by returning to profitability, generating cash and restoring our financial position to its pre-covid strength. let me start with some highlights from the quarter, then i'll address the upcoming quarter, our fleet strategy and the beginnings of our deleveraging journey. our first-quarter pre-tax loss of $1.5 billion includes a $1.2 billion benefit related to the payroll support program.
net of this benefit, restructuring items and extinguishment charges associated with the prepayment of debt, we reported an adjusted loss of $2.9 billion. our people out in the operation, along with the commercial and finance teams, came together nicely to produce great cost performance. adjusted operating costs of $6.3 billion were 33% lower than 2019, slightly higher than we anticipated at the outset of the quarter with half due to higher fuel expense and the other half due to recovery and covid-related items. nonfuel casm was up sequentially as expected on 10% higher capacity, as we restored our employees to full work hours and incurred costs to prepare for the recovery.
adjusted fuel price of $1.91 per gallon was 33% higher than 4q, driven by market prices and losses at the refinery, which drove a $0.23 per gallon headwind in the quarter. on the consumption side, we realized a 12% fuel efficiency gain compared to 2019, with nearly half of that a direct result of our fleet renewal. daily cash burn averaged $11 million in the quarter, improving from $12 million in the december quarter despite stepped-up expenses. improved receipts in march drove $4 million of daily and positive cash generation.
we ended the quarter with $16.6 billion of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $19.1 billion, roughly flat with the december quarter, though above where we expected to be due to aircraft financing decisions. let's now look forward into the june quarter. we expect a nearly $2 billion improvement in our pre-tax result. if the recovery progresses in line with our expectations and fuel remains at current levels, we expect to narrow our pre-tax loss to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with progressive improvement through the quarter to breakeven in the month of june.
a key driver of improvement will be the sunset of our middle seat block, increasing our inventory available for sale at minimal cost. we also expect continued strong performance on our nonfuel cost and still target levels below 2019 by the fourth quarter. in 2020, the teams delivered strong cost performance by baselining aggressively. in '21, we are focused on driving cost leverage as we rebuild the network and revenue returns.
we are seeing that leverage materialize in the june quarter, with a small increase in costs on a 20% increase in capacity, driving a 12% to 15% improvement in nonfuel costs sequentially. compared to the same period in 2019, nonfuel casm is expected to be 6% to 9% higher, including three to four points from rebuild items. adjusted fuel price is expected at $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than 2019 by more than 10%. bringing these items together at the midpoint of our guidance, june quarter total operating expense is expected to be down approximately 35% from june quarter 2019.
we expect daily cash generation in the june quarter as demand further improves. now let me comment on our fleet strategy, a key enabler of our cost performance. our accelerated fleet transformation drives more than $400 million in annualized cost benefit relative to 2019, driven by fuel efficiency, simplification and gauge. these benefits have enabled excellent cost performance and will support further inflection in our financials as the demand recovery accelerates.
since the pandemic began, delta has taken a measured approach in matching supply with demand. that discipline, combined with the great work of our fleet and tech ops teams, have positioned us to capture fleet efficiencies while preserving optionality on upside capacity levels for the future that will utilize flex fleet if demand warrants additional capacity. as glen said, we have the ability to flex capacity in either direction based on the demand. the teams have plotted a path to invest in our fleet with maintenance that will either support higher flying levels if warranted or largely offset costs we'd otherwise incur in the future.
let me now move to the balance sheet. with our cash flow and earnings close to inflection, we've begun to reduce our debt levels and chip away at our $4 million daily interest burden. in the march quarter, we set in motion our first phase of debt reduction. using $3 billion of our liquidity, we are paying down debt, funding our pension and acquiring aircraft in the june quarter with cash.
combined, these initiatives drive $240 million of annualized savings and free up $2 billion of lending capacity. on april 1, we contributed $1 billion to the pension. this accelerated contribution, along with strong returns produced by our pension team, position the funds to be more than 95% funded by year-end under the pension protection act that determines cash funding obligations. on a gaap basis, we expect to be more than 85% funded by year-end.
we are now assessing an additional contribution of up to $1 billion to achieve fully funded ppa status by year-end. it is really exciting to see our long-term pension vision crystallize. the combination of contributions and strong returns over time now position us where we expect no material contributions to the plan beyond 2021, freeing up an average of more than $1 billion annually of our cash flow. adjusted net debt is expected to be $19 billion to $19.5 billion in the june quarter as we draw down liquidity to fund the pension plans and pay cash for aircraft deliveries in the june quarter.
we expect normal amortization of debt, including the $600 million unsecured maturity in april, to be approximately $850 million in the june quarter. we're also working on a longer-term vision to restore and improve upon the strong financial position we enjoyed pre-covid. our financial foundation has greatly helped us to weather this crisis while investing in our future and avoiding dilution for our owners. in closing, i am proud of what the delta team has accomplished over the last year.
the delta difference that ed mentioned has never been more important nor has it been more pronounced, thanks to all 75,000 of you for protecting each other, our customers and our future. we have exciting opportunities ahead. and with that, i'll turn the call back over to julie to begin the q&a.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody, and thanks for your time. welcome, dan. so here's my questions.
my first question is, i was wondering if you could talk about -- maybe, glen, this is for you, how you expect the non-u.s. recovery to look by the different regions over the next, say, six to 12 months, if you can? and then, my other question is, i think, glen, you might have talked a little bit about this in the atl line. are you seeing that people are booking further out? and i don't know if you can talk to like after labor day bookings or even holiday bookings, how they're comping to previous levels?
glen hauenstein -- president
so helane, first, about the entities a little bit. we're seeing a u.s.-based demand recovery to the open countries in the transatlantic. and we expect our loads to move -- to be close to historical levels, running probably in the low to mid-80s by the august, september, october period. again, you know that 212(f) restricts europeans from coming to this country.
so i think we focused on those countries that generally have high u.s. outbound demand. and as we move forward, we will be adding a little bit of capacity, but essentially keeping our levels flat where we would normally cool down in the september, october time frame and focusing on our european hubs and distributing traffic through them. so i'm pretty optimistic about how the results could play out in the transatlantic.
and that's really -- we have 35% to 40% of our travel still missing, with the european origin piece not open for sale and with business really not recovering at the same level as leisure. so pretty optimistic about where we can get to on this leg, but there's a lot more to come in the transatlantic. in latin, it's really the tale of two markets. one is the close in u.s.
point of origin leisure market, as well as mexico business, both of these are actually exceeding 2019 levels. so short-haul latin is doing quite well, and we continue to expect that to be very, very strong as we move into the more traditional leisure season in the late fall. and then, the pacific, which i think ed has talked in the past, we expect this to be the laggard due to low vaccination rates and continuing outbreaks over -- and restrictions in the pacific. and we really don't see any impetus for that to be lifted.
now i think we're looking at a 2022, at the earliest probably, significant recovery in the pacific. so atlantic, clearly, the furthest along. that's great for us because 65% of our international revenues are in the transatlantic. so we're excited about what we see in terms of u.s.
demand there. domestically, post labor day, this is -- every month that we look from august to september and october, clearly, as you move out, you have fewer and fewer bookings. but we have about a third of our september bookings on the books now. and we have -- as it sits today, and we expect to give some of this back, but we have positive yield in every one of the entities.
we have sequential improvements in rasm. so i think we are seeing very strong indications of demand through the post labor day period. of course, those are initial indications. we have a long way to go as we move closer and closer to those departure dates.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
gotcha. that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, everyone. and thank you for the time. maybe just some cost-related questions. on casm, they're expected to remain fairly elevated in q3.
how do you think about the delta in driving casm from up 11% to 14% in q3 versus 2019 levels to flat in q4? i get about half of that is rebuild costs. but maybe what's the bridge and the moving pieces? and more broadly, how do you think about cost headwinds and inflationary pressures? 
gary chase -- chief financial officer
well, sheila, we talked about the major drivers. the key is really leveraging the continued build of the network. and as i was describing in prepared remarks, generally, when we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we have a pretty big reduction in our activity level. this year, we expect that to be relatively flat.
that gives us the opportunity to leverage the things that i was describing to get some good incremental leverage on our people, some good incremental leverage on our asset utilization. and it's just a natural outcome of the way the capacity progression is moving. in terms of how we see the bigger pieces, they don't change that much between the third and the fourth quarter. we expect that rebuild expenses will still be at elevated levels in that five- to six-point range in both quarters.
and one of the things i mentioned on the last call from a mix point of view, both the second and third quarters, we've got about a five-point drag from not having anywhere near as much of our long-haul international flying, which is just structurally very low casm, long stage length flying. as we move into the fourth quarter, it's still a headwind. it's not quite as much. it's about three points.
so that's the color that i would add.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from conor cunningham with mkm partners.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hi, everyone. thank you. it's great to hear that corporate continues to improve as people return to the office. i will -- i do have to ask, like your competitors are now pushing to replicate some of your success that you've had with large corporates.
so i was curious if you could talk to the moats that you've built around that franchise and how you anticipate strengthening that segment in the face of potential competition.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, conor. it's a very important segment for us. and we have won, as i think you know, business travel news airline of the year for 10 straight years, and we expect to hopefully win it again this fall as well. our team does a magnificent job of servicing the accounts, providing the technology, the access, the insights to make their job and travel in delta as easy as possible.
and that's supplemented by the great product and service that our people put forward every single day. we're the leading operational airline in the industry. so when you marry up the investments that we've been making, particularly in the premium product sector, which our corporates are a main consumer of, with the great service ourselves and commercial team provide and the product and operational integrity of the business, it's a very, very strong moat. we have gained share over the pandemic, meaningful amount of share that we have gained.
and the one thing that we have seen is when customers come to delta, they don't leave. and so we're gonna continue to expand upon that.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
good to hear. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hunter keay with wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. i got two questions for you. the first one is for you, ed.
how do you feel about deleveraging the balance sheet if it hurts your ability to maintain market share?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
good morning, hunter. i have to ask you first, are you sitting on a rocking chair asking that or no? 
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
actually, i am.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i'll rock back in my chair as i answer to you.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
i really am. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
that's good. that's good. deleveraging is important to us. it's something that -- first of all, we're the same team that's been here for over the last 15 years.
we believe in de-risking our balance sheet and paying down debt. and we also know that we can do that while also driving a premium product and service offering in the markets that we see as being critical to delta. we were able to do the both, do both of those things over the last decade, and we'll continue to do that. the level of debt that we took on over the pandemic, candidly, it's a meaningful amount, but it's not an overwhelming amount.
it was about $8 billion of net debt that we took on during the pandemic. and when you think about, as gary mentioned, we're basically done funding our pension plan with no more pension contributions required. as i think you also know that we've been averaging, over the last several years, close to $3 billion, $2 billion to $3 billion a year in stock repurchases, which clearly we won't be doing in the next, certainly, in the next two to three years until we get our investment-grade metrics back and another $1 billion on top of that of dividend distributions that we've been making. there's a substantial amount of free cash that is available to us as we reclaim investment-grade for delta.
and we'll be sharing our longer-term metrics at the investor day in december and showing you the path forward. but we can do all this and have plenty of headroom to compete hard and effectively in the marketplace. 
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, that's super helpful. thank you. and then, gary, if you would just clarify, i think you said something about 7% capacity. are you saying that the current plan for '23 system capacities to be 7% above 2019, but you can take that higher or lower if you need to? am i interpreting that correctly?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
no, hunter, that's not what i was saying. what i was saying is that the fleet actions we've taken give us the potential to add seven points to our capacity profile by '23. but i was also noting the flexibility that we continue to have with some of the flex fleets to go up or down. and i think the teams have positioned us really well to react to what comes at us in terms of the demand environment.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
i see. ok, thank you, gary. thank you, ed.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jamie baker with j.p. morgan. 
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. and just apologies off the bat that my colleague, mark, isn't joining us. but he is on one of your aircraft on the j.p. morgan-sponsored business trips, so i guess, we are all better off.
glen, is there a way to tell what portion of summer domestic revenue is driven by reallocated international demand? for example, could you look at skymile behavior this summer, identify what portion of those travelers would have historically been in europe or asia instead?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, i think, domestically, we see a redistribution toward domestic from long-haul international. that's a natural occurrence. i think people are ready to get out. the exact quantification, i think, would be difficult.
but we do see that if those leisure destinations are open, there's significant demand for that. and that includes the transatlantic where it is open. and if you think about running load factors in the mid- to high 80s in the shoulder season as we head to the end of the summer here, just on u.s. origin travel, there's pretty strong demand trends that we're seeing.
and so if it is open, people want to get there. 
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, definitely. and gary, just a follow-up on the atl. and i haven't historically obsessed about the air traffic liability until we all sort of had to. ordinarily, the second- to third-quarter sequential decline for delta would be somewhere around, i don't know, $750 million, $800 million.
if we continue to get international reopening, particularly for inbound u.s., could we model for something closer to a flat outcome next quarter? so staying in the $6.5 billion range, that sort of thing, or would that just be too ambitious? i know you said it would be above last year's levels, but that still leaves a lot of room. 
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, jamie, obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty around that. our thinking right now, and that's embedded in how we're thinking about net debt is for a slight decline in that. but we don't expect that you're gonna see the normal seasonal pattern as we move through the remainder of this year for all the reasons you just highlighted. 
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, perfect, thank you, everybody. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephen trent with citi.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
hello, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. just a quick one from me. when we think about in certain pockets in the united states that we are seeing some difficulty with new variants and low vaccination rates, do you see any scenario in which delta could trim capacity to some of these regions or reinstate on some routes, blocking of middle seats?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
good morning, steve. i don't. as we've been monitoring our bookings, and clearly, we're mindful of the risks around covid and the new variants and the continued information that the cdc provides us with, we have not seen any reduction or drop in demand, looking out over the next one to 90 days which is about as far as our crystal ball can go right now. we know our customers are largely vaccinated.
our people are largely vaccinated. we have over 72% of delta people are vaccinated and the vaccines work. and they're giving people the ability to get back to their lives. so no, we're not anticipating any changes at this time.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
ok, appreciate that. and looking forward to seeing you guys in december 15th, as i believe you said. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
december 16th.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
16th, excuse me.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
you can fly down and see us on 15th, too, if you want.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from myles walton with ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning, ed. i think, at the beginning, you mentioned commercial partnerships and creating $1 billion of value from wheels up and clear from a zero cost base. i'm curious of your view on the e-retail market given the news by american, as well as united on that front, and where that fits in your portfolio of investments and operations over the medium term.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, myles. as you can appreciate, every one of the proposed manufacturers has been after delta. we've heard from many of them. we're studying this space.
and we will continue to get smart in the space. i think it's at a very, very early stage right now. and i think a lot of the plans that we've seen are a bit premature candidly. but it's not anything that we are unaware of.
and i guarantee every one of those manufacturers would love to have delta colors on their planes. so hard to predict timing, but we are in the marketplace having lots of conversations.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then, maybe, gary, just a clarification. the casm-ex questions. i'm just looking in absolute dollars, it looks like sequentially 3q, you're looking for the same unit cost x and fourth quarter, the same.
and the improvement was really just about comps in 2019. is that right? and then, for 2022, how much of these rebuilding costs go away and we get the tailwind of six points?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'm not sure i would characterize it exactly that way, but it is about having more scale relative to 2019. so sequentially, i think that what you outlined is roughly accurate. and that is what we expect. as we go into '22, your question was about the sustainability of the rebuild? 
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, what goes away from what you're doing?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, we definitely expect those to moderate. a lot of that is going to depend candidly on how the demand environment develops. what i would say is what we've articulated is driving to levels below '19. we're not excluding rebuild expenses.
this year, they happen to be particularly high. as we get into '22, we expect those to be more normal, and it's part of the thought process on what we've got to accomplish.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
myles, if i could speak to that for a second. we at delta, our no. 1 task is to safely get our business back up with the service levels that our customers deserve and expect of delta. and given the huge surge in demand that we've seen over the last 90 days, the entire industry is challenged with that.
that's not a unique delta position. and we're going to do everything we can to get ahead of it. and that includes staffing levels, providing whatever support we need, to the service providers, the service contractors, training, maintenance. because we realize that this is about protecting our brand and our long-term customer base rather than trying to manage costs for an individual quarter.
we will hit the cost targets that we mentioned to you. one of the things that we learned a lot about delta over the pandemic is our ability to manage down labor cost is really unique in this industry. and we have a whole lot more to more tools and flexibility, i think, than we ever really appreciated. and so we shouldn't think about labor which is the biggest part -- a big part of the rebuild cost.
as a fixed cost, that's not going to stay. so the productivity, the efficiency, the ability to work closely with our people will be in really good shape on the cost front next year. and we'll protect our customers' experience at the same time in the revenue base, which is the most important.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from savi syth with raymond james.
savanthi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. competing on products is kind of good for the consumer in the industry. but one of your competitors plans to grow like first-class, extra leg room seats by about 10% a year through 2026. and just kind of curious if that level of growth is something we'll see at delta because it's part of some kind of a structural trend, or if that has any implications to delta's premium kind of revenue leadership, or how delta is set up to kind of compete against that.
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. well, i'd first like to say, we're proud that we started the decommoditization process many, many years back and we are well along. and i think we're objectively maybe the furthest along in terms of exploiting that opportunity. there's probably more space out there for other carriers, given the appetite we've seen for these products that have been sustained through the pandemic.
so i'm not gonna articulate on anybody else's plan. but we think that there's continued growth in our fleet evolution as we continue to up-gauge the airline over the next several years. our percentage of seats that are in the premium cabins continues to increase. and we think, given the fact that we are still in the early stages of being able to distribute those products and services to all of our customers through all of our channels, that there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow that space in the next years, next several years. 
savanthi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that makes sense. thanks, glen. and maybe a quick follow-up for you, glen, as well. just i appreciate the color on the domestic corporate demand recovery.
i know that's around volumes. is that rpk? and curious what that looks in terms of revenue. i'm guessing volumes have to recover first, and then revenue comes back. but i was just wondering if it's similar or if there is a disconnect there?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, those are passengers. and yields on domestic leisure are up. yields on domestic corporate are down. but we see trajectory in domestic corporate, and we expect that, as you say, to continue as we move forward.
savanthi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank. 
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning. i guess, two projection-related questions for glen. on amex, over the last year, you sort of had backpedaled on when you would get to the $7 billion of contribution, obviously, because of the pandemic. the fact that, i guess, the month of june or the june quarter, we were 110%, 115% in the month of june.
glen, can you update us? are we now not on just track, but maybe at a pace that will get to that amex bogey prior than the previous forecast?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, well, i think that's something you'll have to come to our december investor day to see. i don't think we're ready to disclose the exact date yet. but it's -- suffice it to say that we're feeling much better about making up some ground that we lost during the pandemic today than we've set six or nine months ago.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah, i would -- mike, this is ed, if i just chime in. i would say that we are thrilled with the relationship with american express, our team, their team. i was with steve squeri last friday, and i think we have the best-performing card in their entire portfolio. delta, even though we are the highest value that we create, i think we're also the best performing on top of that in terms of growth.
so it's really been a great relationship. and that's still without a lot of travel spend. that's missing international and business yet from the card, so we're excited.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then, just sort of a second projection question, glen. i mean, to watch you go from 20% of corporate volumes to 40% and 60%. and yet even recently, i think we had a survey from u.s.
travel and even the dbta, talking about u.s. corporate travel getting back to, i don't know, 70%, 85% by 2024, it just feels very conservative. i mean, it seems like we're running well ahead of that. is that the case? or is there just something different to where you guys are outpacing the industry?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mike, this is ed. let me chime in on that one, too, because i've got the numbers right here in front of me. we've done our own survey, talking to our clients, the biggest companies in the world and a very large number of them. and i could make heads or tails out of what the gpa was speaking to either.
let me give you the most recent survey, and this is as of last week, updated. 36% of our big corporates expect they're going to return fully to pre-covid levels no later than next year, 2022. that's 36%. another 21% says fully back no later than 2023.
interestingly, only 5% of our big corporates say that we never return to pre-covid levels, 5%. that had been 8% in previous surveys. that's now down to 5%. while 38% indicate, it's still unclear as to what their levels.
not that they're not getting back, it's just the level of flying and the timing is still somewhat uncertain, which is understandable. so if you take the 2022, 2023, that's 57% no later than '23. and you assume, say, 75% of those unknowns, a 43%, that gets you actually to 90% back over the course of the next couple of years. and frankly, i think it's going to be even better than that.
so this is one of the things that as we have seen, there's enormous pent-up energy and demand for travel. also in that survey, 93% of our customers said they're going to increase travel in q3 over q2, and many of those by meaningful amounts. so i think the surge is coming. and just as we've seen it on the consumer side, we are getting ready for it on the business side.
and once you open businesses, offices and you get international markets opened, i think it's gonna be -- it's really -- it's going to be a very good run over the next 12 to 24 months.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great, great insight, gentlemen. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi. 
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning, ed. you have a good board, in my opinion, lots of experience driving real value in consumer industries, maybe arguably easier consumer industries. can you give us some insight into debate at the board level regarding balance sheet improvement as a priority right here and now versus investment? are there differing opinions on investment rate versus balance sheet improvement? and i guess, longer term, is investing half of your operating cash flow how we should be thinking about 2022 and beyond? or have we kind of moved away from that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, duane. we do have a great board, i agree with that, and there is a lot of good insight that we garnered from that board. this is largely the same board that's been with us over the last decade. it was the board that was involved in how we delevered coming out of the financial crisis in 2009, how we managed the -- to lead the industry in getting back to investment-grade metrics over five years ago while delivering a premium product and service level and expanding internationally at a rate probably faster than anyone, particularly with the investments that we've made.
so the board knows the strategy that we're on. we've talked a lot at the board level about needing to get our debt down off the balance sheet to get those investment-grade metrics back. we'll give you some very specific guidepost on that when we have our capital markets day in december, so you'll know what to expect from us. and at the same time, we're also investing meaningfully into the business with opportunistic purchase of airbus 350s and 737-900s that are current vintage.
they're plug and play, and we'll continue to be able to grow the business accordingly. so the strategy actually is not that different from where we've been. and i think it's going to -- we're going to stay very focused to getting the investment-grade back and growing the business at the same time.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, appreciate the thoughts.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joseph denardi with stifel.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. good morning, ed. in response to mike's question, you said, i think based on your time with steve, that the delta card is amex's highest value. like what do you mean by that? are you trying to say that it's a very profitable card for amex as well or their most profitable card?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
no, i don't know if it's the most profitable. i hope we are. you'd have to have steve that. but what i can tell you is it creates the highest overall level of spend and growth in the portfolio.
and it's been that way for some time, and it continues, and we both continue to invest to keep it that way.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, ok. and then, gary, you said the fleet actions would allow you to add seven points to asms by 2023. so what level of asm production are you on track, you kind of achieve in '23? i know there's a lot of flexibility. but does the current fleet support 100% of 2019 capacity in '23, 105%? like where are you now with that? thank you.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
yeah, joe, we'll talk more about that and what our long-term capital needs will be in december with you. what i was pointing out was the portfolio of decisions that we've made gives us seven points of additional capacity that we bring in that time frame and just continue to point out that the team has positioned us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to go, either up or down, depending on how we see the demand environment. but we'll have more color on that with a bigger picture about how some of the other components play into it as well.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna international.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so your marginal cost per mile in 3q was just under $0.04, and it's ticking up sequentially significantly. and i realize that, as you said, you're just pulling up capacity here.
but i was wondering at what point, whether it's in asms or revenue, where the -- where we could expect to see this operating leverage for the costs that you've taken out over the last year or so more clearly show up in results. meaning, normalizing for the change in your marginal cost per mile from the second to the third quarter as you spool up here, what kind of a more accurate run rate looks like, and that would -- also assuming corporate does return as you expect by the end of the year?
gary chase -- chief financial officer
well, chris, on an underlying basis, we still have and are experiencing a lot of leverage even as we move into the third quarter. that will be the case for good bid here. the guidance we have in the third quarter, we are still operating 28% to 30% below we were in 2019. so there are parts of the system where we're under pressure as i described, and we're absolutely meeting the needs there.
but there are also lots of opportunities for us to drive that leverage, some of which, you're seeing in terms of the moving pieces are, at least, i think, unrelated to that. a big cost pressure, as we've moved from the second to the third quarter, at least a couple of points, is just selling-related expenses we're, obviously, thrilled to be seeing. and it's just a function of the demand recovery that we are experiencing. normally, when we're in a typical year, we work very hard to not be maintaining aircraft during the peak summer months for obvious reasons.
we want them flying and generating contributions. this year, we've got a maintenance step-up as we move from the second to the third quarter. in fact, i think when you look at third-quarter maintenance, it will be comparable to, if not even slightly ahead of where we were in 2019 instead of the down 30-ish percent that you've been seeing over the last few quarters. so it's a year with a lot of unique features in terms of how they play out on the cost side, but the fundamental leverage that we've been describing is there.
julie stewart -- investor relations
and now we'll go to our final analyst question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew didora with bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
great. good morning, everyone. i just kind of want to go back to the costs. obviously, the labor market is very tight right now, and i think your last base pay increase was in october of 2019.
so gary, is there anything in your 3q or 4q casm expectations for a wage increase? and i guess, ed, how are you thinking about the need for one right now?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew. we're -- we don't preannounce what we're doing on our labor strategy and cost. and obviously, our people are working really hard and delivering great value. we're still losing money.
we need to get the company stabilized first before we start talking about wage increases. 
andrew didora -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then, last one for ed. i'm not sure if you're gonna have any comment on this. but the end of last week, the president issued an executive order, and you just called out slot administration as one of the objectives.
what do you think this means just given your position in a pretty stock and train market here in new york? i just love to hear if you have any comments on that. thanks.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i really don't -- we'll study. we'll talk to the administration and department of transportation and secretary buttigieg and many individuals about it. we have a long history of driving great value for our customers. it's expensive to drive great value, and we are making the investments to drive great value.
there's no question, when you think about the level of service, the quality of service, reliability, the affordability, everything is moving in the right direction. so we're thrilled to be able to show them the actual results of what we're doing.
julie stewart -- investor relations
that will wrap up the analyst portion of our call. i'll now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing & communications officer
well, good morning to all the members of the media. thank you for your time this morning. we're grateful for that. and katie, if you wouldn't mind reiterating for the members of the media the rules of asking a question with one follow-up, please.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- analyst
while you're planning for the rest of the year, if you can talk about the numbers versus the percentage increase that that will be? and then also, if you'll comment on whether you're having any trouble finding enough people to hire?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mary, this is ed. we missed the first part of your question. could you repeat that? 
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- analyst
yes. i wondered if you could say how many employees you're going to add the number versus the percentage increase.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
over the course of this year, we're in the process of hiring between 4,000 and 5,000. 
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- analyst
and are you having any trouble finding applicants for those jobs?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we are not. the delta brand is a very strong hiring brand. we're having great success. the challenge, as i mentioned on the call, is the training, the time it takes to get people in position, whether it's on the phones and reservations or in the airports.
it takes a few months, and the demand has come back at such a fast clip. it's taken us all a little bit of time to catch our breath. but we'll be fully back over the next couple of months and providing -- we've been providing great service, but the service levels that customers should expect and deserve, you'll be getting back from delta in the next couple of months. 
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- analyst
ok. and have your flight operations been affected at all in terms of lack of flight crews? 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
not at all. not at all. we've been managing the best completion factor in the industry, and it's not even close. our team is doing a good job.
we've been at this for over a year, managing the training queue and the training pipeline. and our pilots and our maintenance team are doing great.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- analyst
thank you very much. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tracy rucinski with reuters.
tracy rucinski -- thomson reuters -- analyst
hi, good morning. i was wondering if you have any updates on your plans for the trainer refinery and particularly on the outstanding liability on the buying of fuel credits?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
tracy, we don't have anything, any news in that regard. we continue to operate trainer, and the team does a very nice job there. we've said in the past that there are opportunities to pull another strategic partner, and we'd be open to that. relative to the question around rins, we are fully accrued.
so i know there's been some discussion in the press about whether we pulled away from acquiring rins. we just know the pricing of rins is not a market-based price at the present time. and we are not going to spend good cash chasing a fairly -- a marketplace that isn't transparent. so we've accrued the cost, but we have time to decide as we settle those obligations over the next couple of years.
tracy rucinski -- thomson reuters -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david koenig with the associated press.
david koenig -- the associated press -- analyst
oh, hi, well, mary asked my questions, but if i could kind of follow up. i know, ed, you said that it's too early to raise wages. but what about starting pay? are you having to raise starting pay to attract people or do anything else out of the ordinary to find those 4,000 to 5,000 folks?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
it's interesting, dave. we've looked at, potentially, hiring bonuses and other incentives. and largely, we have we haven't needed to resort to that. people look at the delta brand as a place they want to be, long term, and they see this as an opportunity to get inside delta.
so no, we haven't had to make any changes to scale. we always watch it. we're very competitive in the market. we pay well.
our people, we take great care of them. but no, we haven't had to adjust our salary scales in any meaningful way.
david koenig -- the associated press -- analyst
ok, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dawn gilbertson with usa today.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- analyst
hi, good morning. my questions are about the customer service wait times. they still are as long as six hours, at least as recently as yesterday. so i'm wondering, from a traveler's perspective, is there any end in sight? i've also noticed that you guys have temporarily suspended help through twitter dms, which is a frequent recommendation i and other travel reporters give.
so is there any end in sight? and what's your best advice for people to reaching delta, especially with last-minute travel questions? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, dawn. this is ed. we are hiring a couple of thousand people into reservations. we've already hired at least half that number, and we've got more to go every single week.
more and more people are getting on the phones. we've reached out to many of the people at reservations who have retired as we had separation packages and voluntary departure packages over the last year. we have a fair number of them that have returned. they're on the phones.
we have people working from home. it's not a question of not providing the staff, and we're doing everything we can. the volumes are beyond anything we've ever seen. they're beyond the high point of 2019, and the handling times are substantially longer as people have more questions, as travel has changed, it's their first time back.
so we're incredibly sensitive to it. the number you mentioned is not the average number at all. yes, there are reoccurrences of that. we have the callback features in place.
we manage every one of the queues, whether it's the general skymiles queues, the premium queues, the nonmember queues. and we're all -- at the longest, the average we are seeing is in the one-hour time frame, which is, by the way, way too long. and by september, we expect to get that back down to normal levels. 
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- analyst
could somebody comment or get back to me on the twitter dm? because you guys appear to be the only one of the major airlines that's temporarily not responding via dm.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'm not sure about that. we'll get back to you. and by the way, people email me every day, every hour. and i think that's a good way.
if somebody needs help, just send me a note. i'll take care of it.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. for the employees that are coming in now that you're hiring, are they on average at lower wages than some of the people that left since a lot of senior people took retirement? and then also, for the 28% of employees that are not vaccinated, are there certain work groups that that's concentrated in? are you doing anything to increase the vaccination rates across the company?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
your first question, leslie, yes, the starting rates of people joining the company are clearly lower than the rates that people retired at as they left the company after 25, 30, 40 years of service. so we are getting a juniority benefit in the scale. we're giving a lot of people -- a lot of our, particularly our young managers are having opportunities to take on more responsibility and grow in their careers, and that's all very, very healthy. your question around vaccinations, the 28%, could you repeat that? 
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- analyst
what are you doing to increase that vaccination rate across the company? and is that -- do you see that's concentrated in any one work group or geography due to best access on information?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
listen, 72%, candidly, we're proud of it. it beats any national average by a meaningful amount. we do have pockets within the company in certain regions and certain demographics that are below 72%, and we are doing everything we can to continue to encourage and incent. we provided $1 million last month in total awards to vaccinated employees through drawings.
we had 40 different drawings with $25,000 a piece. i think we have one more drawing today that we have of anyone that's just been newly vaccinated within the last month to win $25,000. we've given away free travel to employees through drawings that can be vaccinated. and we continue to describe the risks to individuals if they're not vaccinated from the variant.
so i don't know a company that's doing more to get its team vaccinated than delta.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from alison sider with wall street journal.
alison sider -- the wall street journal -- analyst
hi. thank you so much. i'm just curious what you are hearing about the mask mandate on planes, if you think it will be lifted in september? and i guess, how you feel about that, if you are hoping it will be lifted earlier or if you'd like it to be extended?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, ali, i don't know what's gonna happen. it's up to the fda. it's not really up to the airlines to make that decision. we'll be in conversations, clearly, with the fda.
i think it's important that medical experts make those decisions, not airline professionals, as we've learned through the pandemic. they're the ones that have all the insight and the information and keeping people safe. i appreciate people not wanting to wear the mask. i don't like wearing the mask when i'm onboard either, but it's something that we need to do to keep each other safe.
and i think with your question about what's going to happen in september, it really depends on where we are in the recovery phase. if the variants are continuing, i think people are going to be a little more careful about lifting the masks. if international borders are not yet opened, i'm not sure lifting the mask is going to help opening up those borders. so there's a lot that goes into that, and i think there's many pros to taking the mask requirement off as there are to keeping it on at the present time.
alison sider -- the wall street journal -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from madhu unnikrishnan with skift airlines weekly.
madhu unnikrishnan -- skift airline weekly -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my call or my question. i had a question about the federal payroll support and whether, based on the arguments delta management made last year, if you still believe that the support was facilitated faster recovery protected jobs. and the second part of my question is what happens after october 1 and whether -- and what burning off of or the expiration of support will mean for delta's earnings?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, the -- i think it's, without debate, that the federal support was critical to keeping our industry afloat and keeping our employees employed and being in position for the recovery. as we've talked on this call, one of the biggest challenges we're having now is getting everything fully stood up even though we've kept a lot of our employees. so you can imagine had to actually let many, many people go and abandon those individuals, the challenges we'd be facing in our country of getting travel moving again. so i think it's been an incredible success.
i think one can debate the length of the psp2 and psp3, i see no interest in going beyond what we have at the present time with psp3. and we expect to be profitable in q3 and beyond without any psp support, yes.
madhu unnikrishnan -- skift airline weekly -- analyst
thank you.
tim mapes -- chief marketing & communications officer
katie, we have time for one final question, please.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from david slotnick with tpg.
david slotnick -- tpg -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've seen in the last few weeks with unruly passengers. has there been any upward or downward trending in incidence of that? and do you have any thoughts on just what's been causing the sort of surge this spring and early summer?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
you know, david, i -- we haven't seen any meaningful shifts. it's been something we've been dealing with over the course of the pandemic. i know some people want to relate it to having to wear masks. i'm sure that's a piece of it.
i don't know that's the main piece. i think the bigger challenge is that we've got a lot of individuals that have been impacted. their emotional well-being have been impacted during the pandemic. and as people are coming back out into society, you see challenges in all walks of life, not just in our industry.
you see it happening in other places, as well in society. so obviously, social media amplifies that and puts it on a stage. that's not our experience. it's not our normal experience by any means.
they're rare. our crews are trained and they're incredibly professional in managing the conditions when we have someone who doesn't want to follow instructions of the crew and, unfortunately, something we've become good at. and i look forward to the return of our business and patterns of normalcy so that we can start to manage our business without having to worry about these effects. 
tim mapes -- chief marketing & communications officer
thank you for the question, david. and thank you to all the members of the media for your time this morning. as we wrap up, we'll turn it over to ed for final comments.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i thank you all for joining us. it's been an hour and a half. we spent a fair bit of time with you, but hopefully, you've learned a lot as to why we're encouraged. and as we power our plan for the post-pandemic future, why that i am and our team is as optimistic as ever for the journey that we are on.
u.s. travelers are returning, and it's really a tribute to the incredible work of our scientific community in developing effective vaccines, that's gonna be key to opening the world. our return to profitability in the month of june is a major milestone. a solid profitability close to 10% speaks to the strength of our brand and the great work of our team worldwide.
as we move past this inflection point from crisis into restoration, the people of delta will be front and center, serving our customers and our communities. our mission of connecting the people of the globe is a noble one. it's an important one. it's got great purpose.
and the social good that's generated by travel will be essential in the months and years ahead as our world heal. so i thank you all for your time today for joining us. and one more time, i want to say a special thanks to all the delta people worldwide for their great work over the course of this last 16 months and getting our business to a point where we're looking to bright skies ahead. so thank you, all.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines june quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is katie, and i will be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
julie stewart -- investor relations
thank you, katie. and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us for our june quarter 2021 earnings call. joining us today from atlanta is our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our interim co-cfo, gary chase; and our entire leadership team will be available for q&a.
ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy. glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and our brand momentum, and gary will discuss cost, fleet and our balance sheet. i'd also like to welcome our incoming cfo, dan janki, who's with us in the room today but will not be participating in q&a... similar to last quarter's call, we've scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure that we have time for plenty of questions.
[operator instructions] after the analyst q&a, we will move to our media questions. after which, ed will provide a brief closing statement. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie. good morning, everyone. i appreciate you joining us this morning. as we speak, we're well into the summer travel season.
and if you've been to the airport in recent weeks, you've seen firsthand how travelers are reclaiming their lives and returning to the skies. this increase in demand drove a better-than-expected revenue outcome for us in the june quarter, with revenues down 49% versus 2019, resulting in a $6.3 billion total revenue. this was an impressive 76% sequential improvement from the march quarter. more encouragingly, the momentum is continuing as we exited june with a demand environment that's accelerating.
domestic leisure demand and yields are above june quarter 2019 levels, and we see clear signs of business in international demand recovery heading into the fall. through the crisis, we've earned an unprecedented level of brand loyalty and trust, thanks to the world-class service, operational reliability and innovation that drives the delta difference. and our commitment to safety, cleanliness and wellness is as strong as ever. the people of delta are our strongest competitive advantage, powering our resurgence and running the best operation in the industry.
it is because of our people's incredible work that delta was honored as the no. 1 airline for 2021 by j.d. power. i want to thank every member of the delta family for the professionalism, spirit of service and warmth you show to our to customers every single day.
i'd also like to thank our crews and operations teams for continuing to put our customers and their safety first as we restore our business. we are now in active recovery of our business, and the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing. but we're taking all the right steps, primarily through increased staffing levels about delta and our contract service providers to service this demand without compromising on the standard of care and cleanliness that our customers have become accustomed to on delta throughout the pandemic. and even with these challenges, our team continues to run the very best airline in the industry, leading on all key operating metrics for the month of june and year to date.
for the june quarter, we narrowed our pre-tax loss to $881 million. this was meaningfully better than initial expectations, driven by demand strength. importantly, we achieved significant financial milestones during the quarter. these include returning to profitability in the month of june with a pre-tax margin in the high single digits despite still missing 40% of our prior revenue from june of 2019, generating $1.5 billion of free cash flow and nearly $200 million of adjusted free cash flow in the june quarter.
achieving solid profitability and generating meaningful free cash flow a little over a year from the start of the worst crisis in this industry's history is an impressive statement about the resilience of our business and the great work of our people. in showcasing the value of the commercial partnerships that we've developed, leveraging the delta brand, we have created almost $1 billion in investment value this year through our partnerships with wheels up and clear. and i want to point out that $1 billion is against a zero cost base. i want to give a big shout out to kenny dichter and the wheels up team as their listing on the new york stock exchange goes live today.
we're proud to be a wheels up exclusive commercial airline partner and largest shareholder with a stake valued at over $500 million. also, congratulations to caryn seidman-becker and the clear team on their successful ipo. our investment in clear is worth approximately $340 million. and finally, i want to congratulate sir richard branson and our team at virgin atlantic for making history last weekend in completing their first fully crude space flight.
it was exciting to watch richard break new barriers once again, this time, commercial space travel. i'd take the time to mention these relationships because of the much larger ecosystem that delta operates and attracts, and these opportunities to create value will continue to be nurtured as we extend our brand beyond traditional airline boundaries. with june profitability in the books, we're now in the restoration phase of recovery and focused on harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and our resilient competitive advantages to drive sustainable profitability in the second-half 2021 and enable long-term value creation. specifically, for the september quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit pre-tax margin as demand continues to improve with the return of corporate travel and gradual reopening of international markets.
we are starting to see signs of a resurgence of business and international travel, both of which are supporting the next leg of the revenue recovery. and we're well-positioned to take advantage of both, with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network. around the country, more and more offices are opening, and people are reconnecting to their businesses and to each other. with 72% of our employees vaccinated, we officially reopened our own offices last month in june.
and as i interact with other ceos, i'm encouraged to hear about their own plans to accelerate their return to office. that sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate survey, with almost 95% of our accounts indicating they'll be returning to their offices by the end of this year. domestic corporate volume grew from 20% base in march of this year, in the march month that is, to 40% recovered in the june month, and we expect it to be close to 60% recovered by september, based largely on these reopenings. i'm also encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in international.
while we know international demand recovery will be very choppy and uneven, we're seeing strong bookings to europe when countries open their borders. from our experience in the u.s., we are seeing the impact that widespread vaccinations have on reopening the economy. we know the same will be true for the rest of the world over time, but are mindful of the risks that new variants pose to the pace of recovery, and our team will stay very disciplined in restoring international capacity. as the recovery builds steam, we are making the required investments, including hiring frontline and reservations employees and investing ahead of the full recovery of the airline in places like maintenance and training.
this will allow us to continue to provide industry-leading service levels and prepare the airline for success in a stronger-than-previously expected demand environment. these investments are key to the execution of our strategy to win, which is defined by providing best-in-class service to our customers and leveraging the brand while creating a simpler, more efficient airline. the power of our brand has come through the crisis stronger than ever, and we're seeing evidence of this across the business. the resilience of our american express co-brand credit card program is a great testament to the increasing brand affinity that we have.
card spend on the delta american express portfolio in the month of june was 115% recovered to 2019 levels for the same month despite travel purchases still being off by 25% in that same period. we're continuing to renew and simplify our fleet. and yesterday, we announced that we're opportunistically adding seven airbus 350s and 29 737-900ers that will enter service over the next 12 to 24 months. these are current vintage to the aircraft that we operate in our existing fleet, and we're adding these pre-owned aircraft for substantially less than the cost of new planes.
these aircraft align with our fleet strategy that's focused on simplification, scale, size and sustainability and create optionality for future growth or replacement in a capital-disciplined manner. these transactions accelerate our recovery plans, which also began with the exercise of 25 airbus 321neo options in april. the a321neos, which will start to deliver in 2022, offer the lowest seat cost in our fleet and will strengthen delta's gauge advantage relative to our competitors. our recent actions on fleet enhanced efficiency throughout the cost structure.
gary will talk more about this shortly, and will highlight the progress that we're making on our balance sheet and journey back to investment-grade metrics. as our recovery path becomes clear, so does our future as a carbon-neutral airline. in 2020, we committed to our airlines carbon neutrality and we're taking actions today that are critical to our future. this includes the reduction in emissions that we're achieving with our fleet renewal, investments in sustainable aviation fuel, together with many corporate partners and the evaluation of long-term investments in carbon reduction and removal technologies.
during the quarter, we released our inaugural 2020 esg report, which expands on the corporate responsibility reports that we have issued in the past. you'll be able to hear more about our esg commitments as well, importantly, as our multiyear financial targets and vision, moving forward, at delta's capital markets day, which we will be holding in person in new york on december 16. this event will give everyone an opportunity to hear from our management team, which over the past year we've strengthened by bringing in outside perspectives and promoting our deep bench. that includes allison ausband, who during the quarter, pleased to announce, was named our executive vice president and chief customer experience officer.
in addition, john laughter, who i'm also pleased, we announced as our new executive president and chief of operations. allison and john are delta veterans who bring deep experience and unmatched expertise to their roles. in addition, our incoming cfo, dan janki, brings extensive business and financial skills to his role, as well as a broad global perspective and operational experience that will serve us well in the recovery and beyond. dan's background makes him the ideal leader to advance our efforts to restore delta to our pre-pandemic financial position.
you'll hear from him briefly before gary delivers the financial update. with this great team of servant leaders, we're building an airline that's positioned to drive long-term value for all our stakeholders, our people, our customers, our owners and our communities where we live, work and serve. i could not be more excited about our future. and now i'd like to turn it over to glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
thanks, ed. and good morning, everyone. 16 months after the start of the pandemic, i'm encouraged by the pace of the recovery and excited about our future. delta is well-positioned with a powerful brand, strong competitive advantages and a differentiated customer experience, all of which are increasingly driving deeper customer engagement.
during the quarter, we saw consumer demand for travel return at an accelerated rate as pent-up demand drove an increase for air travel. as customers return to the skies, delta is their airline of choice given our industry-leading service that's provided by the best employees in the industry. this resulted in a more than $2.7 billion improvement in revenue from the march quarter. compared to 2019, revenues were 49% lower, beating our initial guide on 39% less sellable capacity.
bookings in domestic and short-haul latin and leisure markets recovered to nearly 90% of 2019 levels. and during the quarter, we began experiencing strength in demand to select european countries as they reopened. domestic business travel is on an improving trajectory with corporate volumes 40% recovered in the month of june, doubling from the 20% recovery rate in march. small and medium-sized enterprise volumes continued to outperform corporates by 10 points and are now 50% recovered.
i'll talk more about the encouraging trends we see in corporate in a few minutes. from april to june, passenger unit revenues improved by 25 points with both load factor and yield strengthening through the quarter. this is a great accomplishment considering that we had the middle seat block in place for the month of april, which when lifted on may 1 resulted in a 45% increase in sellable capacity with minimal incremental costs. so kudos to the delta team for managing through this transition period and driving these outstanding results.
i also want to congratulate our cargo team for an outstanding quarter with cargo revenues up 35% compared to the june 2019 quarter despite running a much smaller operation. we are also seeing momentum in daily bookings and net cash sales. our average net cash came in 20% higher than forecast, doubling relative to the march quarter. importantly, in the month of june, our average net cash sales are 70% restored to corresponding 2019 levels.
that's earning about 10 points ahead of revenue recovery as customers are making travel plans out into the future. as ed mentioned, we're exiting june with a demand environment that's much stronger than just three months ago. since the start of the year, we've seen a sequential revenue improvement from 35% recovery versus 2019 in the first quarter to 51% in the second quarter. that trajectory is continuing, and we expect our september quarter total revenue to be 65% to 70% recovered on capacity that's 70% to 72% recovered when compared to the same quarter in 2019.
this positions us for another significant sequential improvement in unit revenues. at the midpoint of our guidance, this represents another $2 billion sequential increase in revenue on approximately 10% higher capacity. we expect strong leisure demand to continue through the fall and winter, and we're starting to see the next leg of the recovery take hold with improving trends in business and international travel. delta is well-positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network.
corporate travel volumes accelerated in may and june with almost 95% of our accounts booked in travel in the month of june. we're also beginning to see a return of consulting and sales-related travel and higher volumes in traditionally business-heavy markets like new york city and boston. our recent corporate survey results show that over 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the september quarter, up from just 33% in the march quarter. in addition to these survey results, our close engagement with customers give us increased confidence of the acceleration of business travel, especially as we move toward the post labor day period as schools and offices continue to reopen.
we expect domestic corporate volumes will recover between 55% and 60% of 2019 levels by the end of the september quarter, up from 40% at the end of the june quarter. despite volatility in global covid recovery trends, international travel is accelerating, with capacity and load factors increasing as we head into the fall. when we spoke last quarter, only two european countries had reopened for u.s. citizens.
today, more than 15 european countries are open, and we're seeing strong bookings follow as border closings lift. we are also helpful that 212(f) restrictions prohibiting inbound travel to the u.s. will be significantly reduced in the september quarter. the recovery in short-haul latin exceeded 2019 levels.
but in long-haul latin, demand remains muted as many countries are still closed. specific demand remains low and will likely be the last region to recover. delta has a strong platform internationally due to the structural changes in the landscape, but more importantly, because of elements unique to delta. first, we will have the no.
1 joint ventures in each entity, and our international partners will emerge from their restructuring efforts more competitive than before. we look forward to continuing our valuable strategic relationships with all of our global partners as they navigate through the covid-19 crisis and as they position themselves to emerge from their restructuring processes. we are confident these strategic relationships will accelerate our international recovery in the years to come. second, our hubs are powerful, offering extensive and efficient global coverage.
the strengths of our global hubs resemble those of our core domestic hubs, namely strong presence and local share and the ability to connect traffic efficiently. third, our wide-body fleet renewal will be instrumental in our recovery and path to higher margin. adding the seven a350s announced yesterday build on our long-term plan efforts. our wide-body fleet renewal program improves our product offering, enhances our cargo capability, reduces our unit cost and is more efficient -- fuel-efficient, contributing to a more sustainable future.
as we rebuild the airline, we're optimizing the network for the return of business in international travel and are building on the strength of our core and coastal hubs where we've been able to improve our local share by three points from pre-pandemic levels. we also continue to put the customer at the center of everything we do, creating an enhanced premium experience. this is successfully de-commoditizing air travel on delta, providing customers with the products and flexibility that they value most. premium products are demonstrating resilience where demand is strongest, with domestic and short-haul latin premium revenues outpacing main cabin by five to 10 points.
we believe this will be reflected at the system level as premium revenue and other entities improves with a return of business and international travel at scale. we're also seeing increases in customer engagement and brand momentum. this is evident in skymiles acquisitions, which set an all-time record in the month of june, outpacing the prior record achieved in july of 2019. these acquisitions allow us to bring new customers into the delta ecosystem.
engagement is also coming through the performance of our co-brand credit card program as customers are increasingly seeing the value proposition and continue to aspire for travel, status and premium experience. for the quarter, co-brand spend was 110% recovered to 2019 levels, driven by improving t&e spend indicating customers' desire to explore the world and reconnect with friends and family. we exited the quarter with co-brand spend around 115% recovered for the month of june. new co-brand account acquisitions improved more than 75% sequentially and were around 90% recovered to 2019 levels for the quarter.
in addition, we're seeing more customers moving into premium co-branded cards given the value proposition for those products. the improving trajectory resulted in cash renumeration from american express in the month of june exceeding 2019 levels. we expect renumeration will continue to remain at or above 2019 levels into the second half, with significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. in closing, the foundational building blocks for our long-term success are in place.
with the industry's best domestic and global network, renewed and efficient fleet, a de-commoditized product and a highly valued brand and the industry's best employees, we continue to extend our commercial and financial lead. combining that with our efficient cost structure puts us on a path to improve on our pre-pandemic margins and generate sustainable free cash flows, allowing us to reinvest in the business and restore our balance sheet strength. delta's future is incredibly bright. and with that, i'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our incoming cfo to delta.
dan, i'm looking forward to working with you. and now i'll turn the call over to you for a few minutes.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
thank you, ed and glen, for the warm welcome. i'm certainly pleased to be here and begin working closely with ed, glen and the entire executive leadership team to ensure that we continue to establish clear priorities, deliver on our commitment and build a more resilient, valuable delta. there is no doubt it is an interesting time to join. but what really drew me to this opportunity at delta is a unique culture, industry leadership and growing brand strength with customers.
it's a combination like no other in the industry. it's really clear that there's a great deal of talent in the finance organization. i'm humbled and honored to lead this organization forward through this pivotal time. a key guiding principle for me will be open and transparent communication with the financial community.
i look forward to speaking with all of you and getting to know the key stakeholders in the coming weeks and months, including many of you on the call. now i'll turn it over to gary for the financial update.
gary chase -- chief financial officer
thank you, dan. and on behalf of the entire finance team, welcome to delta. good morning, everyone, on the call, and thanks for joining us. delta people shined and carried our brand to new heights during the crisis.
those efforts, combined with the strong demand recovery glen described and the benefits of operating a simpler, more efficient fleet, are enabling us to cross a number of key milestones on our journey to return to and exceed 2019 performance. let me quickly review the second quarter, then provide color on our second-half cost outlook. i'll wrap with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet. starting with highlights from the quarter.
we reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of $881 million, a more than $2 billion sequential improvement and generated a solid june month profit despite revenues for the month of june still 40% below 2019. nonfuel costs rose 6% sequentially on 21% higher capacity as the teams continue to rebuild our network efficiently. nonfuel casm was 9% higher than 2019. we realized savings from tax credits and third-party rate reductions that were offset by rebuild expenses and maintenance and pilot training and a noncash expense for employee flight passes awarded to our employees in recognition of winning the j.d.
power award. adjusted fuel price per gallon of $2.12 was 11% higher than the first quarter, including a $0.23 per gallon impact from refinery losses. we realized a 7.1% fuel efficiency gain versus the june quarter of '19, with the majority driven by fleet renewal. demand momentum fueled cash sales across the booking curve, driving $1.5 billion of growth in our air traffic liability to nearly $7 billion, now $300 million higher than the same period in 2019.
with the strength we see in the demand environment, we expect our air traffic liability to remain above 2019 levels into next year. daily cash generation was substantially positive for the full quarter. more importantly, we generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, excluding our $1.5 billion pension contribution and $2.5 billion in psp grant proceeds. we are transitioning now away from daily metrics to focus on regular free cash flow, the best measure of value creation as we turn the corner on profitability and look to restore our financial strength.
as we head into the second half, we're excited to shift our focus to returning to profitability, generating cash and restoring and exceeding our pre-covid results and financial position. with continued recovery in limited cost growth, we expect to be profitable in both the september and december quarters at current fuel prices. regarding the cost outlook, i'm very happy with the team's performance in the first half as we continue to rebuild the network efficiently. we remain on a path to achieve nonfuel casm below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter, though the strength of demand recovery is creating some welcome cost pressure in the form of higher rebuild and selling-related expense.
we have also experienced inflationary pressure from vendors. and our operating teams have accelerated hiring of frontline employees to ensure we maintain excellence in operations and service levels as we rescale. despite these pressures, we will see continued leverage in key areas. for example, we expect an approximate 8% headcount growth through the end of the year on a nearly 15% increase in asm production.
we'll see our fleet utilization rise from 2q levels, approximately 15% below 2019 to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. our airports will also see better utilization, particularly our coastal hubs as they move from 70% to more than 90% restored. as we accelerate maintenance and training to meet higher potential capacity in '22, rebuild expenses are stepping up in both the third and fourth quarters to a five- to six-point cost headwind versus three to four points in the first half. september quarter will see nonfuel costs grow sequentially at roughly the same rate as capacity due to the higher rebuild and revenue-related expenses i mentioned.
with these factors, september quarter nonfuel casm is expected to be 11% to 14% higher than 2019. we expect to close the gap to 2019 nonfuel casm in the fourth quarter through continued volume leverage as capacity remains essentially flat from the third to fourth quarters instead of the more normal seasonal decline of approximately 15%. adjusted fuel price per gallon for the third quarter is expected at $2.05 to $2.15. and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than the september quarter '19 period by approximately 5%.
on the capital outlook, we now expect gross capex of approximately $3.2 billion in '21, up from our original guidance of $2.5 billion, driven by our aircraft announcements. hats off to our fleet and technical supply chain teams for landing these compelling opportunities that meet three key criteria. these transition -- transactions are opportunistic and take advantage of attractive economics in the used market. these aircraft types are currently active in our fleet and entirely consistent with our fleet simplification strategy.
in addition, these aircraft, along with the 321neo options we exercised in april, will support the potential for up to seven points of additional capacity restoration at compelling marginal economics by 2023. we have a lot of additional optionality in our fleet plan to flex capacity up or down at low cost depending on the shape of the recovery. our 717 and 767 fleets are our largest levers. we're still flying these fleets at scale today and could retire additional units or reactivate parked aircraft to meet higher demand scenarios.
let me now move to the balance sheet. with improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position, we're using cash to reduce leverage and nonoperating expense while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. during the quarter, we prepaid $450 million in aircraft-related debt in addition to normal amortization of $875 million and contributed $1.5 billion to the pension plans. additionally, we paid cash for all but three aircraft deliveries.
since october, our debt reduction initiatives have totaled $11 billion and freed up $6 billion in collateral. with the additional funding this quarter, we do not foresee the need to make any material pension contributions in the future. by year-end, we expect the plans to be fully funded on a pension protection act basis and 90% funded on a gaap basis. with this level of funding and the plans frozen to new participants, we are now reducing the investment risk of the portfolio to protect our funded status.
the great work of our pension and treasury teams over the last decade in funding this obligation frees up roughly $1 billion in annual free cash flow that can be used in the future to further delever or otherwise create value. adjusted net debt is expected to be approximately $19 billion at the end of the september quarter, modestly increasing from where we ended june as we pay cash for aircraft deliveries. as we turn the corner on profitability and look to the future, we're excited to shift our focus to restoring our business and delivering long-term value for our owners. restoring our financial foundation remains a top priority as we position for the future, and we look forward to sharing more of our long-term vision with you in december.
let me conclude by congratulating the 75,000 people who make the delta difference a reality every day. these excellent results are your scorecard and a reflection of all you do to delight our customers. with that, i'll turn the call back over to julie to begin the q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll go first to jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. first question goes potentially to glen and dan. so pre-covid, i had asked paul about the amount of time that it would typically take delta to recalibrate the higher fuel prices.
i'm not staring at the transcript, but his estimate at the time was four to six months, which was an improvement from historic levels. so my question, i guess, for glen is whether the booking curve is steep enough right now that you might actually be able to recapture the top line more quickly than that. and similarly, for dan, whether there's anything we should be taking on the cost or operations side that could accelerate the process. i'm basically just trying to understand whether four to six months is still the right estimate for us to be using.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i would just comment, i think we're a bit in uncharted territory here as the recovery continues. and while i think it might be difficult in the very short run, despite the fact that the booking curve has moved in a bit, that i would estimate that, that four to six months is about right because we believe that demand and capacity will fall back into a very good equilibrium by next spring which would put you inside that window.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. all right. so no structural changes that you can identify that would greatly alter it one way or the other then?
glen hauenstein -- president
no. i think i would think that that would be where we would expect it to manifest itself in the same window.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then second question, just as it relates to the international demand that you're seeing from europe since the biden announcement, can you say how skewed the improvement is to the european point of sale? i'm just trying to reconcile some data that we have here that largely excludes europe point of sale, just so trying to get a feel whether it's 70-30, 60-40, 80-20, something like that.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, that time of the year is actually -- the winter season has more european sales than the summer season, so we're talking probably about more of a normal split, if that's what you're asking, 60% us origin, 40% european origin. and the interesting part about this is that we have seen an uptick in both sides, not just european sales. the assumption there is that there are a lot of europeans in the us that were worried about getting back, so very nice uptick as we get to november and december beyond the 212(f) being lifted.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you, glen.

we'll go next to duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks for the time. so in terms of the cost guidance, which is where we're getting a bunch of questions this morning, can you just bridge from the early september commentary that you'd miss being down year over two by a little and today where you see it up 6% to 8% on a unit basis? what are the main buckets? what changed over that, call it, five, six weeks?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
let me go -- what i'd say is, first, number one, capacity, as we pulled down the schedule in the fourth quarter, was the driver; and then also the pace as it relates to the rebuild and preparing for demand for 2022. those were the two factors that led to that.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then on fleet restoration, would you put some numbers to that? perhaps what is that in 2021? and what do you expect that to be in 2022? and do you have a sense for when we cross over from sort of fleet restoration investment to the benefits we were hearing about a while ago from fleet simplification?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. the restoration, when you think about bringing aircraft into service through 2021 to '22, we'll bring back into service 160 to 170 aircraft. and that's really the element that the vast majority of that rebuild is focused on bringing those aircraft back. and then as we restore to more fully restored capacity levels to '19, that will dissipate and trail off and be transitory in nature from that perspective.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
duane, this is ed. if i could add a couple of points on the overall cost outlook. we are committed to our long-term guide, and we'll talk more in december at the capital markets day as to where we see costs going over the next couple of years. clearly, in our business, there's a race to try to capture the available demand and standing our business back up after an unprecedented level of disruption to ensure that we are not experiencing any kind of operational limitation in our ability to get our service levels and customer expectations met.
so we put the pedal down to get the staffing in place, to get our service levels back, to get the quality of performance that drives the brand premium that this company stands for. and it may take us a few extra quarters to get down to that '19 and below levels, but that's still our goal.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. i appreciate the thoughts. thank you.

we'll go next to brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
yes. good morning, and thanks for taking the question. and, ed, you kind of answered it there. but i guess, dan, is it still right to be thinking 2019 costs are the benchmark here, especially just given all the wage inflation that we're seeing across the economy?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. it's certainly a clear marker for us. we believe as we restore this airline, we'll be at or better than 2019 cost levels.
brandon oglenski -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
and so is that just literally a function of the network getting back to where you were utilizing that pre-pandemic, especially with longer-haul flying coming back?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. there's -- certainly, as we transition through this and we restore and get through the rebuild, that will dissipate. you bring back the capacity, you get that leverage. you also get the balance between the domestic and international.
and then when you think about the more structural elements, the elements related to fleet simplification start to come through and you get those benefits related to that, both in fuel and fuel efficiency and also in our operating costs.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
brandon, this is ed. i can echo what dan's saying. we've taken the opportunity over the last year to rebuild this airline back piece by piece, and we're learning a lot more about what we want to keep forward and retain and what parts of the business that we don't need to be retaining and some of the cost structure. and so there's efficiency, whether it's in catering, whether it's in our operational performance, literally every part, our g&a, every part of our operations.
hard to see when our capacity is still only at 80% or more below -- or excuse me, at 2019 levels, but we are very determined to make certain that we retain the value for the period of time we've just been through. and that efficiency will show through. it's going to take a little bit longer, and that's why it will be really important in the capital markets day that we show you the pathway to get there.
brandon oglenski -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thank you.

catherine o'brien with goldman sachs.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. maybe just one last follow-up on the cost outlook. so i think you guys have made the point clear that we probably need to see more of an asm recovery, not only in total amount of capacity deployed, but, of course, on the network allocation as well as you restore some of the longer-haul wide-body flying.
but i guess just if we could talk a little bit more about pace, like do we need to get to a full restoration for that to occur? or like going from 90% to 100% recovered, do we suddenly see a real acceleration in the leverage you're going to get across the business? or just any high-level comments on how to think about pacing as we approach that.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
we'll give you certainly more color and put a pin on it as we go to capital markets day, give you the outlook, and also get more into specifics around 2022 guidance when we give you that. the real thing i think to look for is the two elements. it's going to be bringing back -- bringing down that rebuild cost related to the fleet and when we get that restored, and that's going to really pace pretty closely with the return of capacity. and then, obviously, the incremental leverage.
so i think on that piece, you're going to get it throughout that period of time, but it's really that -- getting that fleet rebuild component down. and that will happen as we progress through that period.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. got it. and then maybe just one more on international. so on cnbc this morning, you noted that the company saw a tenfold increase in international bookings following the announcement on the us borders a couple of weeks ago.
can you just help us frame when we really start to see that momentum build in revenue? it sounds like there's some of that hitting in november, december time frame, driving your more optimistic outlook on those months versus october. but are there also any early indications maybe for next spring or summer? would love just to hear when you think we're going to start to really see that show up in revenue a bit more.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure, catie. yes. we're going to see it in november and december. we're looking at a 10-point recovery improvement, just going from october to november.
october, we're estimating at the 65% restoration level, which is where we've been for the last couple of months, and we see a big jump up in november and december. international is a piece of that. it's not the only driver of that. business travel is an important piece of that as we see that continuing to improve.
we see in our bookings, i mentioned, i think, on the cnbc piece this morning that just in the last week, our cash sales were up 9% week over week, and that's a trend we've been seeing here for some period of time, steady growth. so i think you're going to see it then. i think we saw here in the summer, there's going to be a mad rush to -- for those that want to travel, that need to travel to get out and travel. you may see a little bit of a pause as you get into the january, february time frame, but i think spring and summer is going to be another tick back up at an even higher level.
and my view is that you're going to see, particularly for europe, which is the biggest part of our international base, spring/summer next year that look very much like the spring/summer we've just been through here in the us.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thanks for that.

we'll go next to hunter keay with wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. good morning. glen, these surveys that you say, are you asking corporate travel managers these questions or the travelers themselves? and also, how are your contingency planning if we get into late next fall and business travel's up only 80% of what it was pre-covid? what sort of contingency plans do you guys have in place?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, first, i'll answer the first part of the question. that is a survey that goes out to travel managers. so that's their reply. second -- and we do other surveys that go through our skymiles program for frequent travelers and their return to travel.
and i would say those surveys are pretty well in saying clearly consumers feeling much more confidence than business travelers in terms of their -- what they expect to fly more. but more and more, we're seeing the business component accelerate. so that's pretty exciting for us. and then on contingency plans, i think we are committed to remaining incredibly flexible.
we know we're not fully out of the woods yet, and we know there's going to be more chop. it's not going to be a straight line out, and there will be twists and turns, whether it's fuel, whether it's -- whatever it is, that's part of our business here, and we're always managing the sum of all the input. as it relates to business travel, what i'd say we're super excited about is the fact that we were able to report a profitable quarter despite 60% of our business travel are still not traveling. and we know that number is greater than 60% for next year.
we don't know whether it's 90%. we're thinking it's somewhere between -- ending next year between 80% and 100%. but what -- if you look underneath the hood there, i think the point that we're trying to point out is that demand for premium products is actually exceeding our coach products with the business traveler out. so i think the big epiphany for us was there's a much broader demand for this than just business travelers.
and if we have to pivot to demand sets for high-end leisure to fill those seats, that trade is a trade-off we'll make and i think one that we could be quite profitable with under any scenario.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hunter, if i could echo some of glen's comments there. none of us know what the classic business travel, the volume is going to come back. and obviously, in our industry, we're bulls. we're optimistic that it's going to come back plus, but i think we -- it's also safe to say it's going to come back differently.
and there's going to be some level of demand erosion, no question about it, some element of behavioral change, no question about that. but there's also new opportunities to travel. hybrid, for one, gives you a very different outlook in terms of where people work, how they work. i've spoken a lot publicly over the last number of months that video technology not just -- doesn't force you to stay in your home.
it actually allows you to take the office with you when you're out on the road and stay connected better and many, many other reasons. so we're going to talk about that in december because we know that's a big question on a lot of people's mind as to what the future of business travel is. and i see as many bright spots coming out of this recovery as some of the demand disruption elements, video technology, and other things and behavioral change has wreaked during this pandemic period.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then i've always thought that the lack of unions wasn't so much a cost advantage for delta but a service advantage. is there a way that you can maybe get a little bit more creative next year to maybe push that a little bit harder to drive some favorable casm without sacrificing the frontline morale? did you follow me?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'm not going to comment on the benefits or lack thereof of unions. we have a union. we have a great relationship with our pilots, and we have a lot of our employees are nonunion. we have great relationships and great productivity from them as well.
what i would tell you about our people is that they're incredible. the reason we have the revenue premium we have is not that we're necessarily smarter than anyone else, basically provide the best service, the best reliability, the best product in the sky. and it's not a cost game. it's a performance game, and it drives better revenues.
it also drives more productive cost efficiencies. we've talked a lot over the last few quarters here about the need to get our staffing levels back. i mentioned this morning that we're bringing back 8,000 people -- brought back 8,000 people this year. don't forget, we had 17,000 that retired this time a year ago.
so we are getting significant flexibility and productivity from the team as we get out to the future, and our people will continue to lead the way.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
we'll go next to conor cunningham with mkm partners.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, everyone. thanks for the time. one issue i think people struggle with is just the baseline for capacity given the fluidity in the demand environment. you mentioned all the headwinds to revenue and higher fuel.
i'm not asking for a number, unless you want to give them. but how has the thought process changed toward first-half capacity over the past couple of months? i heard -- and i also heard that you made a comment about 2019 capacity being -- potentially being achieved in the second half. is that your expectation right now?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think we've remained very fluid throughout the entire crisis, and that's our commitment, to remain very fluid until we get back to full restoration. we don't know exactly when that's going to be. and we put the marker out there. right now, if we want it to be bigger than we are, quite honestly, we couldn't be.
we could be a little bit maybe, but not much bigger without risking operational performance issues like we've seen at some of our other carriers. so we want to stay where we're confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there. we think those -- and we talk about rebuild costs and getting people back and getting planes back. we're doing all that now in the background with the capability of achieving 100% of 2019 sometime in the back half of next year.
whether or not -- as we get closer, we actually use that flexibility up or down. we'll give you more color on what those decision points are at investor day. but the name of the game for us right now is maintain flexibility. and as dan alluded to, even in the quarter we're in, we're slightly below where we thought we'd be in terms of revenue production just about eight to 12 weeks ago.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
right. ok. cool. and then to follow up on hunter's question, the premium products continued to perform really well.
and i guess in retrospect, it makes sense with pent-up demand and just the consumer being flush with cash. but how do you think about the premium cabin as demand starts to normalize? do you think the changes are now structural? or is it really just too early to tell, and it kind of depends on where the demand environment is later on down the road?
glen hauenstein -- president
we believe they're structural. and we believe that -- through the pandemic, we've created kind of a new class of customer, which is the high-end consumer that wants these products that maybe didn't have as much access to them because they were given to the business customer earlier in the booking process. so that's one of the things we're wrestling through as we had -- does our fleet accommodate the higher levels of demand? i think these are things we'll be discussing more with you at investor day, but we do think that there's a higher level of demand for those products moving forward.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and, conor, i don't think it's only pent-up demand and consumers being flush with cash. consumers are looking at travel differently, and they're looking at a lot of things differently in a post-pandemic world. and the quality of their provider, the care in which their provider takes to them, it doesn't matter whether you're an airline or a hotel or a restaurant, whatever you are is continuing going to drive preference and drive influence at a higher level than ever before. and as -- and we consider ourselves the premier provider of service in our country.
we're going to continue to gain, hopefully, an outsized part of that share going forward.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts.
operator
we'll go next to savi syth with raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. just a quick follow-up on conor's question to start with. as you think about the capacity restoration, is there a difference between your narrowbody and wide-body fleet ability, just given the fleet changes?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, the answer is, yes, there's a difference. i don't know what the question is on the difference. what i would say, and we'll explain this a little bit more as we have our investor day, but where we sit today and the inefficiencies of our wide-body fleet, we are flying a significant number of wide-bodies at a stage length that they weren't designed to fly. so for example, if you fly between atlanta and salt lake city today, all of our flights are flatbed.
all of our flights have premium products, and all of our flights are on planes that weren't designed to go 1,200, 1,500 miles. not only is it driving the opportunity of not flying that long haul, but it's driving a higher cost structure in the existing domestic environment which will normalize as those planes get retrenched. now if you ask why they're there, they're there because when we were in the earlier parts, when we were in the cash mode, we wanted to use the planes that didn't have maintenance requirements, that didn't -- that had available pilots in them. so now, as we work to the rebuild, these are all part of the rebuild costs that we've got to identify and explain a little better.
but this should have a double whammy impact improvement because you get better cost structure in the domestic environment and the heavier weighting to the lower-cost international. and they're really two distinct components that are synergistic with each other.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that's helpful. and if i might, you've announced quite a few in boston -- new markets out of boston. i was just wondering if you could provide a little color on the growth out of boston. and just are those plans kind of in line with the kind of pre-pandemic strategy? or is there something different or like newer or different opportunity that you see out of boston?
glen hauenstein -- president
no. i think we were clear about our intentions to be boston's preferred airline pre-pandemic. if you go back and listen to the calls then, it was something that was our intent. and we saw some opportunities in the pandemic that avail themselves.
and we're believing that next summer is going to be a relatively robust demand set to europe. so we wanted to fill out some of the big demand international markets from boston and then some of the opportunistic markets in the pandemic for boston business. so very happy with our -- we have a great team in boston. they're doing a phenomenal job.
we have a great facility in boston, best in class up there. and i think when you put the suite of our products and services, it really is a winning hand for boston.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst

chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking my question. so as we look at the second half of next year and the expectation that you can recover to 2019 capacity levels and drive the nonfuel casm-ex below 2019, could you just help us -- and again, this might be more of an investor day question.
but we think about efficiency. i think you cited about $1 billion off 2019. but if we think about efficiency, fuel initiatives, and then also the change in the network with some of these longer-haul markets that you're adding, two come to mind, atlas and tel aviv out of boston, just how we could kind of put some color around those buckets as we think about your casm-ex into the second half of next year.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
chris, this is ed. it's way premature to be getting into 2022 casm-ex. and i appreciate the interest level. we're going to give you that in a couple of months in december.
we need to have a better handle first on how the recovery shapes in '22, and that's going to drive our plan. but i will confirm that our goal is to get at or below 2019 levels once we have our scale back and once we get the operations restored to where we want it to be.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
ok. and just a follow-up. what is the timing to restart some of these international flights with the easing of, i think, it's inbound from uk, eu, and a few other areas? is it a few weeks? or is that -- should we think about that more as a first-quarter event?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, on the margin, we're adding back some flights into the winter schedule. but as you know, winter is never the peak season for europe travel. so what we're really thinking is, given the lifting of these embargoes, it's going to make for a great spring and summer season next year. and so a lot of our rebuild costs and a lot of the things we're preparing for to have our european largely intact by summer.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you.
operator
we'll go next to dan mckenzie with seaport research.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, guys. i guess first question is for dan.
referencing some of the balance sheet investment-grade commentary, big picture, i'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on the time frame for achieving that. in the past, delta has been able to fix its balance sheet over a five-year period. should we be thinking five years to get to that? or could you potentially get there sooner?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. we're going to talk about the multi-year outlook, as we talked about, at capital markets day. certainly, the balance here between investing and restoration of the balance sheet are going to be key priorities. that will be multiyear.
and i do think that you referenced delta's historical track record there. they've shown real discipline if you look at -- over that period of 2010 through '19 of paying down debt while still building and investing in the airline. and those philosophies will be true as we think about this going forward. and that will be certainly part of our outlook of how we balance both that investing and restoring the balance sheet and the pace of that as part of capital markets day.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. understood. on -- and then i guess, glen, on corporate travel being nearly 80% to 100% recovered by year-end 2022, just looking at where we're at today, can you just help us connect the dots on the various buckets of spend, so in the fourth quarter here? how are the small- and medium-sized businesses behaving versus, say, the large corporates? and then if you could just help us slice that a little bit differently, internationally versus domestically, so areas of corporate travel that are lagging the recovery here versus areas or segments that are in line or doing a little bit better.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, certainly, on the positive side, the unmanaged travel for corporate, for business is running between five and 10 points ahead of managed corporate travel, so the smaller, hungrier companies out there hitting the road sooner than maybe some of the bigger multinationals. and of course, it's more heavily weighted for domestic now, but we've seen a huge uptake with the 212(f) restrictions being lifted. europe was about 15% restored through second and third quarter for corporates. we've seen that double to 30% just in the last couple of weeks, so seeing a nice uptake there, as well as deep south america, which was pretty much nonexistent for the long-haul south america, starting to show some signs of life.
and then the laggards, of course, have been the pacific, which is still largely locked down. so -- but we are expecting those to improve significantly as we move through here as the vaccination rates improve. and places for us like korea and japan are now approaching between 70% and 80%. so hopefully, we get some good news out of that region of the world starting in the next few months here.
and that's really all the color i have at this point.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
sure. thanks for the time you guys.
operator
we'll go next to david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the time. i wanted to ask the cost question slightly differently.
the capacity is supposed to be down 80% for 4q. can you give us a sense for where the -- like the operating resources are relative to 2019 in the fourth quarter? i'm just trying to think about how many crews and pilots and stuff that we have that were working to produce the 2019 schedule in relation to the capacity being down sort of 20% level? is it down in line with that? is it down less than that? can you help us kind of frame the productivity issue?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
the -- i'm not sure i fully understand the essence of the question in regards to -- are you asking where the workforce is relative --
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
yes. so like productive capacity. like if you had 100 people producing 100% last year, and now you're producing 80%, do you have like 85% of the resource from 2019 producing that 80%? is it like -- i'm trying to get -- understand the deleveraging that's happened because of the pull-down in capacity.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
i think as we -- the way to think about it is when you think about productivity measures by group, as you restore, you're getting those productivity levels back and moving closer or beyond 2019. so that's -- whether it's in the airport, whether it's with catering or other types of activities, those progress as you bring that back. there's also situations where we're hiring ahead to ramp up, so those are the unproductive people. that's where you're training them.
you're scaling them before you inject them into the operation. and that's what you call out, specifics associated there with the rebuild.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
yes. i guess i was just trying to get a sense for if you could help us frame how the negative impact of the productivity loss.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
let me take a stab at this, david. we have a lot of premium pay, overtime, a lack of ""productivity"", given where we sit with the rapid rebuild of the airline, getting people in position, getting people ready for the future, as dan said, just covering the operation. and so you have not only just more people than capacity relative to where we're eventually going to end up once our business is restored. but.
on top of that, you've got a higher level of added costs going into the current funnel to ensure that you're delivering great service and building for the future at the same time on a reduced base of capacity. so that's a big part of it. you also have the restoration costs in maintenance and training and other elements that are another layer, and i appreciate you can't see that in the numbers broken out as clearly. but again, these are the things we're going to talk about in december at the capital markets day to show you the trend line.
none of us has ever been through something like this. it's disruptive as is, and as it builds back, i can appreciate the questions. but we see it maybe a little more clearly over a longer period of time than looking at it in the existing quarter.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
that's helpful. i'll just squeeze one more in there, glen. as you think about when we should be getting back to prior period load factors, are you expecting the airline to kind of get back to that high 80s level in '22, '23? like how should we think about load factor recovery?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i think this summer, we were running load factors that we're winning at a couple of points of 2019 levels. so i would expect by next spring and summer that the industry would be back in that zone.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thanks very much, guys.
glen hauenstein -- president
thank you.
operator
we'll go next to mike linenberg with deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. dan, can you just walk through kind of the primary elements on the net debt going from $19 billion to $22 billion sep q end to december quarter end? i guess seasonality probably plays a role there.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
well, when you think about it, there's really three components related to it. one will be you work through -- right through the elements of free cash flow and the movements, right? it's earnings. it's ultimately the movement in working capital, which is the air traffic liability, and then it's ultimately capex. so you have the guidance framework as it relates to the earnings framework.
capex, we've told you, is $3.2 billion for the year, gross capex. we're $2 billion year to date so that implies $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. and then you also have the working capital movement, which is really the air traffic liability. and normally, in a period of time like this, when you think about that, that would be -- that will might move in a more seasonal traditional time in the low teens.
but as we talked about throughout this call, we're not necessarily in traditional seasonal periods of time. so we would expect that to be slightly more muted than that as it relates to movement from it, but those are really the drivers there.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. very helpful. and then just second question to glen. what percent of your revenue is actually tied to government contracts? i mean, i know we have aircraft -- we have the gsa city pair program, and then, obviously, you recently moved the afghan people.
and i realize maybe the revenue number is a small component. i guess when you think about some of the good press that you've gotten from some of your government services, you sort of have to weigh that as well. so sort of a multipronged kind of ask on that piece of your business.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mike, this is ed. i'll take a stab at that since i was asking the same question the other day. and you've got to look at it at a 2019 level, not necessarily at today's level, because government travel is way down, given where -- federal government is largely not open. when you go to dc, a lot of the offices -- people aren't out on the road yet.
but it's collectively in the hundreds of millions of dollars for delta on an annual basis. when you consider charters, you consider all the federal workers that do travel on delta, we have a pretty significant share of those. you consider the us mail that we carry, it's a pretty large revenue base.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
we'll now go to our final analyst question.
operator
and we'll go to ravi shanker with morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks for putting me in. a couple of follow-ups here. the 75% recovered from november and december, i just want to understand if that's what the booking curve is telling you now. or is that a number that you are extrapolating based on the current rate of improvement? i'm just trying to understand if things continue to get better here over the next six to eight weeks, if you can end up with a better than 75% recovery number for november, december.
glen hauenstein -- president
clearly, it's both. it's what we have on hand and what we expect to get, so it's the combination of those two.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. got it. and just a follow-up. on the strong mix that you're seeing in the premium cabin, you said that, that was structural.
a, kind of do you see that evidence in the surveys you're doing with people post flying? kind of like what's the evidence of that? and b, once the -- once corporate and international fully come back, let's say this time next year, do you expect to be flying more premium seats than in 2019 if this bounce you're seeing is truly structural?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i think both of those we're intending on answering at investor day as to show you how we see this evolving and show you all the research behind why we're confident that more premium seats is a direction we want to have.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
that will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. i'll now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
well, good morning, everybody. thank you to each of the members of the media who are gathered here today. we have about 20 minutes to wrap these. [operator instructions] and, jen, if you could remind everyone how to access their question.
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll go first to alison sider with wall street journal.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
hi. thanks so much. just wondering, just given the 212(f) restrictions coming off and, i guess, you're saying early november, what do you have to do sort of between now and then, if anything, to spool up the international operation? what sorts of preparations do you have underway?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, we have -- a lot of the airplanes are still in the desert, so we're working on getting those all ready. we're also doing a lot of interior work. i think one of the exciting things that we want to talk more about next year is, by next summer, all of our long-haul international will have our new premium economy. so that's another thing we're working on.
and that premium economy is really a new class. we started it in '19. we didn't get very far with it. but by the time we come out of the pandemic in '22 to most -- all of europe will have the new premium economy seats, which is something along the lines of a little bit better than domestic first class and a class that we're really excited about.
so getting that configuration redone. our airports are another key thing. we've been working very hard on our airports, whether or not it's seattle with the international terminal, whether or not it's los angeles, which should be largely complete by next summer. there's a lot of work going back into the rescaling, and it really is -- it's all across the airline.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and, ali, there's -- obviously, we have a lot of seats for sale, so a lot of empty seats as we've been really only carrying close to 50% loads for much of the last year across europe. so there's a lot of work going on, as glen mentioned, but there's also a lot of seats that already exist in the marketplace.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
so i guess i'm just curious how you're thinking about sort of your pipeline of pilots longer term over the next year, what retirements are looking like and sort of what the competitive landscape is for pilot hiring going forward?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, we're going to be hiring over the next several years. i think at the present time, we're looking at hiring a couple of thousand pilots over the next 18-or-so months to that question. at the same time, we had a pretty considerable number retire a year ago, about 2,000 also. so we've got this mapped out pretty effectively.
we obviously need to forecast where the international demand is going to go to ensure that we're able to supply it and have pilots in the right spot. but we're, i think, doing a pretty good job of keeping our pilots and our staffing availability for crews in line with how demand is shaping up.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- analyst
thanks.
operator
we'll go next to leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
hi. good morning, everyone. just two quick things. on your hiring, are you seeing lower average salaries now? and do you expect that to continue compared with 2019 as you ramp up? and then on the premium -- paid premium cabin, what are those paid load factors? and is this -- was september a record? and where are things trending now?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'll handle the first, and glen can handle the second question, leslie. on overall labor cost, yes, we're getting a nice juniority benefit as we bring in a whole new generation of employees at essentially every level of the company. we had close to 20,000 people retire a year ago, so the top end of our most experienced -- many of our most experienced employees have chosen to retire, and that's opened up opportunities for younger people. so there is a benefit to that.
we have not changed our hiring weight scales in order to bring people in. we're able to bring people in at our current scales and not having any issue locating great talent.
glen hauenstein -- president
and as it relates to the premium seats, we're selling 10 points higher than we did pre-pandemic, and we always run relatively full in terms of sat load factor, but a lot of those are complementary upgrades. but what we're seeing is people are willing to pay us for those seats, and that's why we want to create more over time. i'm not going to give away what we're going to talk about at investor day but making sure that we have enough to satisfy both demand for people who are willing to pay us for them as well as having an adequate supply of complementary upgrades for our most valuable customers.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. and do you have any number on how many people you want to hire in 2022?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we haven't put that number out yet, but we'll certainly be hiring pilots. we'll be hiring flight attendants and mechanics, i'd say, would probably be the three main areas we'll be hiring next year.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll go next to ted reed with the points guy.
ted reed -- ted reedthe points guy -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i want to ask first about boston, your goals there. do you have goals beyond the top 10 atlantic and the top 20 domestic destinations? and in line with that, as for your competitors, if you're growing in boston, don't they need to grow to? and wouldn't that be part of their case to the justice department that they also need to grow?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, ted, i think you know us well enough to know we're not going to comment on what we think our competitors should or could do. but i think what we see is our product -- the boston market quite well, being a premium carrier and having boston be a very affluent city with a huge component of corporate travel. we think that we are best to deliver the best products and services to the customers in boston, and we're going to -- as i said in previous calls, we don't want to be the biggest. we just want to be the most loved and the most profit.
ted reed -- ted reedthe points guy -- analyst
all right. and i need to ask about the vaccine. do you think you can get where you need to get in terms of vaccines without having a mandated delta? and that without threatening firing, can you get where you need to?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. well, that's our goal, ted. the goal here is to get people vaccinated, and we are on a plan to get people vaccinated. and i think one of the reasons the order came out from the administration was they were uncomfortable that not enough companies had plans to get their people vaccinated.
and we already have a plan, and the plan is working well. we're at 90%, present time, vaccinated. we expect to get to 95% when we get into november, and there will be some exemption requests. so the value will be a small number of people that will not be vaccinated.
i think it is going to be in the 1% to 2% range, not -- a relatively small amount of people. and we'll have to assess that when the time comes. but right now, i think we're fully aligned with the intent of the eo.
ted reed -- ted reedthe points guy -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
we'll go next to david koenig with associated press.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
hi. somebody -- i think it was leslie who already asked about the pay for new hires, which i was interested in. what are you seeing in terms of how many applicants you're getting per job? and how does that compare to pre-pandemic because some of your competitors have commented on that?
glen hauenstein -- president
dave, we're getting great interest in new hires coming to delta. the flight attendants, as an illustration, we just opened up 3,000 new jobs for flight attendants. we had, i think, 35,000 to 40,000 applicants. we had to turn off the application portal within a week because we had so many applicants coming in for those opportunities, so we're not having issues in terms of attracting great talent.
i'd say the rate of interest is comparable. obviously, it depends on work category. some jobs are more technical, and we're having to go deeper into some pools to locate talent. but broadly speaking, we're doing a great job of bringing people to the company.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
well, that's what i was also interested in. and for some of those deep technical jobs, for example, you're not having to raise pay to attract people in this labor market.
glen hauenstein -- president
we're not. we're not.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok. thank you very much.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, dave. jen, we have time for one final question, please, then we turn it over to ed for closing comments.
operator
we'll go to robert silk with travel weekly.
robert silk -- robert silk -- travel weekly
yeah. hi. thanks for taking my question. i'm wondering if you all have received a -- the government hasn't said what's the date for the reopening of europe and these other countries, brazil and so forth.
have you gotten any sort of guidance on that? how important is it to get that specificity soon?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i think we have a lot of intelligence on that, and it varies by country, and it varies by region. so we're monitoring that very closely, and that's clearly a key component to getting international business travel back. but what i would say is that when people are able to travel, even with the tighter protocols, such as testing and documentation requirements, we are seeing significant uptakes in corporate travel. and i'd point to europe, which has not yet reopened, yet our corporate bookings have doubled since the announcement of reopening.
and we'll see exactly how that plays out as europe does reopen in early november, how much further recovery we see there but very encouraging. people want to travel. and as soon as they're capable of traveling, and they have some certainty around it, i think we've seen it doesn't matter whether it's business or leisure. they want to get out and travel.
to be more specific here, i think -- we don't have an exact date as to when the 212(f) is lifted yet, no. it's early november.
robert silk -- robert silk -- travel weekly
ok. is it important to get that soon?
glen hauenstein -- president
it's important to get that date, absolutely. we've been asking every day.
robert silk -- robert silk -- travel weekly
thank you.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you. with that, we'll turn it over to ed for final comments.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. a lot of questions, a lot of good questions, and we look forward to taking you through our longer-term strategy as we get into capital markets day in december and outline for you where we're taking this company and this brand, and i think it's a very exciting future. i also want to thank the people for delta -- of delta for the great work and the spirit of service in terms of how you took care of customers and each other over the course of a very, very challenging summer. our team is truly the delta difference, and we continue to be inspired by the accomplishments of the entire delta team in this environment.
so thanks to everyone for joining us today. we look forward to seeing you in new york at the new york stock exchange on december 16.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines september-quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is jen, and i will be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to ms.
julie stewart, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, jen. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our september-quarter 2021 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today are ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our cfo, dan janki. and ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy.
glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and our brand momentum, and dan will discuss cost fleet and our balance sheet. similar to last quarter's call, we've scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. [operator instructions] after the analyst q&a, we will move to our media questions, after which, ed will provide a brief closing statement. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events.
all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie, and good morning, everyone. appreciate you joining us this morning. the september quarter marked another important milestone in our recovery. we achieved our first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic with a pre-tax result of $216 million and a pre-tax margin of nearly 3% despite still missing one-third of our revenue base compared to the same period in 2019.
we saw a full return of domestic consumer travel to 2019 levels as our customers safely returned to the skies, and our people delivered industry-leading operational performance through a very busy summer, once again showing why they are the best in the business. i want to thank every member of the delta team for your hard work and dedication during the truly historic summer, where we faced the challenges of standing up our operation after such unprecedented disruption. i'd also like to recognize the delta teams who played a central role in transporting 10,000 afghan refugees that were evacuated from harm's way in afghanistan over the last couple of months and delivering needed supplies. it was an amazing effort that involved everyone from delta's flight crews, to operations control, to government affairs, to our charter and fleet team.
our revenue recovery in the september quarter reached 66% of 2019 levels, progressing from 51% in the june quarter and just 25% at the start of this year. this was led by strong consumer demand, growing improvement in business and international travel and reflected the resilience of some of our diverse revenue streams which are already back to or higher than pre-pandemic levels. while the recovery in business travel paused in august and early september as case counts increased, demand has picked up since labor day. last week was our top corporate revenue booking week since the start of the pandemic.
and with the announcement that us borders will open in november, bookings from europe and brazil to the us are rapidly improving. the third-quarter results reflect delta's differentiated position in the industry and a continued focus on executing our customer-centric strategy. this strategy is rooted in providing best-in-class service to our customers, strengthening preference for our brand, and, while at the same time, creating a simpler, more efficient operation. at the heart of our brand promise is operational reliability.
restoring our operations safely and reliably with a strong commitment to cleanliness remains our top priority, and we're proud to be leading the industry in all key operational metrics through the summer as well as year to date. one important indicator is what we call brand-perfect days, those days when we don't experience a single cancellation across our mainline and regional operations. i'm happy to report that we have delivered 116 brand-perfect days in 2021, which are on par with pre-pandemic levels as our people are delivering outstanding reliability. and we're delivering on our commitment, not just to return our service levels to pre-pandemic performance, but to exceed those levels by the end of this year.
a key component is staffing, and we have added 8,000 people to the delta team this year. this new talent is helping us build the airline of the future, which includes a focus on improving diversity and representation across all levels of our workforce. our culture of putting our people and our customers first is building stronger preference for the delta brand. at its core, the delta brand stands for connection, creating unique relationships with our customers, driving strong engagement, higher loyalty, and a sustained revenue premium to the industry.
more customers are engaging with delta than ever before, driving record downloads of our fly delta app and record sign-ups for our skymiles loyalty program. our delta american express co-brand program continues to show strong resilience with card acquisitions nearly 95% restored and card spend 115% recovered to 2019 levels. as a result, remuneration from american express in the september quarter exceeded 2019 levels, totaling just over $1 billion in the quarter, demonstrating the durability of our brand preference as we continue to deepen our customer relationships. our revenue premium and our customer satisfaction has not just endured but it strengthened through the pandemic with both above 2019 levels.
these outcomes are a true validation of our customer-centric strategy and people-first approach. at the same time, we're also building a simpler, more efficient airline. as we rescale the operations and refresh our fleet, we will unlock efficiency gains while also improving our product and customer experience. dan will speak more about our fleet strategy and cost outlook shortly.
as we look ahead, it's clear that the recovery will continue to be choppy, but we see a number of encouraging trends. restoring the remaining one-third of our revenue base is dependent on further business and international demand improvement. in the september quarter, domestic corporate volume was 40% recovered, up 10 points from the june quarter. with the spiking case counts delaying office reopenings, we did not see the progression we had expected at the start of the quarter, particularly after labor day.
but as the variant recedes, business travel has picked up over the last month with volumes now reaching the highest level we've seen in the recovery. in the last week, our domestic business volume was close to 50% restored. we expect continued improvement as offices reopen at the start of the new year, and we anticipate meaningful acceleration in business travel starting at that point. we hear regularly from our corporate customers that they're ready to get back to travel, see their clients face to face to renew business relationships, and develop new ones.
that sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate surveys. more than 90% of our respondents mentioned that they expect travel volumes in the december quarter to either be the same or outpace september quarter. nearly 60% of our accounts are telling us that they've already reopened their offices with an additional 10% expected to open their offices before year end. we are also seeing improving trends internationally, spurred by the decision to lift 212(f).
this decision marks a critical moment in our road to international recovery, and we thank the biden administration and our supporters in washington for their work to reopen travel to the us. thanks to this important policy change, many families are going to be reunited this holiday season for the first time in almost two years. against this backdrop, we anticipate our revenue momentum to show good progress through the december quarter, finishing the month of november and december, combined, at a 75% recovery. this 10-point improvement from current levels is driven by offices reopening, international restrictions easing, and our expectation that consumer strength continues into the holidays.
so putting the year in context, we started at only 25% of our business restored, total business for the company, and we'll end the year at 75% restored. while choppy, there is a clear underlying momentum in our company that gives us optimism as we go into '22. as those fundamentals improve, we also see fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the december quarter. at present time, we're expecting a modest loss in the fourth quarter with crude prices driving that up nearly 60% year to date and more than 15% just over the last month.
while we operate in a volatile and uncertain environment, i have the utmost confidence in our return to sustained profitability as the recovery progresses into the new year. as we continue to restore our airline, our actions are guided by three near-term priorities. first, to deliver for our customers, providing the great service excellence they expect from delta. we've worked hard to get our staffing levels in place, reducing wait times at our reservation centers, improve self-service options, the return of food and beverage options onboard, upgraded wi-fi and in-flight entertainment, and the full reopening of our delta sky club network in july of 2021.
we continue to deliver on the need for flexibility with policy changes and extension of medallion status and skymiles benefits into 2023 to give our most loyal customers more flexibility as travel resumes. our next priority is to rescale our airline efficiently and reliably. we're remaining disciplined about how we're rebuilding our network, prioritizing operations, and matching our supply with demand. a measured approach to restoring capacity is critical to delivering for our customers and to managing through an environment of rising fuel prices.
finally, we're preparing for the future to position delta for success in the next leg of the recovery and beyond. while restoring capacity in a measured way, we are growing share in key markets with high-value customers. we're making smart investments in our business to elevate the customer experience. that includes technology to enable efficiency and improve our digital capabilities while accelerating construction projects in key airports like lax, laguardia, and jfk.
on the balance sheet, we're focused on returning to our investment-grade metrics, having experienced firsthand just how important it was to have a strong balance sheet as we entered the pandemic. we're advancing our fleet renewal and opportunistically acquiring aircraft while maintaining flexibility, driving gauge and efficiency that we expect will improve our long-term cost structure and our carbon footprint. our commitment to being a carbon-neutral airline globally differentiates us as we know that customers are choosing brands that they believe in, and employees are looking to work for a company that's dedicated to a sustainable future. carbon neutrality is a fundamental part of our mission and a meaningful step that we can take right now to protect our world for generations to come.
we've recently announced our commitment to work with the science based targets initiative to set a net-zero 2050 target and an interim emissions intensity target for our airline operations, in line with the paris agreement. this quarter, delta also announced a 250 million gallon offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel on our road to a 10% saf consumption level by 2030. we also announced plans to join several coalitions, including the leaf coalition, the world economic forum's clean skies tomorrow, and the un-led race to zero. you'll be hearing more about all of these efforts at our capital markets day on december 16 in new york.
the power of our purpose-driven brand, our people and our strategy position delta incredibly well for the future. we're building on a strong foundation to extend delta's leadership position in the years to come and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, our owners, and our communities where we live, work, and serve. and with that, i'll turn the call over to glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. generating a profit for the quarter, even with a third of our revenue still to come, is a great achievement and is another important milestone as we continue down the path of recovery. through the last 18 months, we have stayed true to our core strengths and our commitment to the customer. from improving our position in key markets, to growing affinity with our high-value customers, to driving outperformance in premium products and diverse revenue streams, we are extending our competitive advantages.
the september quarter started out strong, and consumer demand environment remained robust throughout the quarter. we had a profitable summer in europe as vaccinated us tourists were welcomed back to the continent. with the variant taking hold in early august, we saw a temporary pause in demand, especially business travel, as many companies delayed office reopening plans. despite the variant's impact, we remained within our initial guidance range with revenues coming in at down 33.8% versus 2019 or two-thirds restored.
this represented a $1.9 billion sequential improvement in total revenue to $8.3 billion. total unit revenue improved 17% versus the june quarter on an 11-point improvement in load factor and a 4% improvement in yield. since labor day, we've seen improvement in demand with daily cash sales growing each week. domestic consumer revenue remains fully recovered to 2019 levels, and we are seeing continued improvement in domestic corporate sold revenue, which, as ed mentioned, is at the highest level we've seen during the recovery.
we expect continued improvement throughout this quarter. on the international front, we continue to see positive trends led by latam with passenger revenues 84% recovered versus 2019, a 20-point sequential improvement driven by leisure traffic to beach markets. transatlantic recovery improved by 20 points versus the june quarter to 35% recovered versus the september quarter of 2019 with corporate sales in this entity now nearly 30% restored. we are also encouraged by the administration's recent decision to lift 212(f) restrictions.
following the announcement, europe point-of-sale bookings for november and december are more than six times what they had been pre this announcement. as we progress through the last few months of the year, we expect strong results for thanksgiving and christmas. the month of october is impacted by the lingering impact of the variant, resulting in an expectation that revenue will be approximately 65% recovered. but as we move into november and december, the sunset of 212(f) and a higher mix of consumer traffic, we are expected to support revenue recovery of the 75% range to 2019 levels.
with these monthly trends, we expect a percentage of revenue recovery in the low 70s for the december quarter. consistent with our disciplined approach of matching capacity to the emerging demand environment, we expect our december quarter capacity to be approximately 80% of 2019 levels. balancing the restoration of our capacity with demand remains a strategic priority for delta and is more important than ever given the uneven recovery and the increase in fuel prices. while fuel is a near-term headwind for our results, we expect to recapture higher fuel in the medium to long run as we return to our more historical correlation between fuel prices and revenue.
as we look to '22, we plan to progress our network restoration in line with demand. we have the ability to achieve 2019 capacity levels by the second half of next year. in addition to this quarter's financial results, there are several other accomplishments that we are very proud of. our premium products continue to outperform.
during the quarter, premium revenue in domestic and short-haul latin outperformed the main cabin by approximately 10 points as paid load factors in comfort+ and first-class cabins exceeded 2019 levels. this is a great validation of our premium strategy, especially given the higher mix of consumer demand. our diverse revenue streams remained resilient. other revenue in the quarter was 91% recovered to 2019 levels.
within that category, loyalty revenues are more than 80% restored, supported by strong card spending and acquisition trends. cargo revenue, which we expect will continue to grow and enhance our future international profitability, was nearly 40% higher despite flying less than half of our widebody international flights compared to the same period of 2019. and mro revenue was more than 90% recovered on increased engine volume. our conservative approach to restoring capacity, combined with the strength of our premium products and the resilience of our diversified revenue streams, resulted in a unit revenue premium relative to the industry throughout the pandemic.
as we close the books on september quarter, we expect that trend to continue with a unit revenue premium relative to the industry, exceeding our highest third quarter on record, even with business and international less than 50% recovered. this result validates a basic but powerful premise, putting the customer at the center of everything that we do, and pursuing diverse revenue streams translates into a sustained revenue premium. as consumers return to the skies, we've been focused on increasing stability and trust. we are also reducing friction points by eliminating change fees, enhancing self-service options, and developing our flex product that provides full refundability for those that value flexibility the most.
we're progressing toward a fleet that is more cost efficient and fuel efficient and one that offers even better onboard experience with a higher mix of premium seats and enhanced wi-fi and ife products. enhancing the customer experience doesn't stop on board our aircraft. it also extends to the experience on the ground. we're accelerating investments in our airports and continuing to innovate.
in atlanta, we're launching digital id, allowing customers to rely on facial recognition to create a seamless airport experience from check-in to boarding. and we're investing in our sky clubs, including two of our largest clubs in los angeles and laguardia, scheduled to open in march and april of '22. as ed mentioned, we are seeing strong consumer engagement and growing brand preference. more customers are choosing our digital channels which are highly effective selling and self-service platforms.
for example, our fly delta app downloads reached a record in the september quarter, up 25% versus 2019 with monthly downloads now surpassing 1 million for the first time ever. higher digital engagement is fueling growth in our skymiles program, which secured the #1 spot against all global airlines in the us news ranking of all airline loyalty programs. congratulations to our customer engagement and loyalty team on this great accomplishment. customers are joining skymiles at a faster rate than the passenger recovery.
for the quarter, our skymiles acquisitions were more than 100% recovered relative to 2019. and finally, our co-brand program continues to show resilience and drive tremendous value for both our delta and our partner, american express, and importantly, to our highest value customers. we're seeing more demand for our premium co-brand credit cards with both new and existing cardholders as more customers are increasing, seeing the value proposition. our well-defined and proven strategy of focusing on the customer positions delta well for many years ahead.
key to our success is the fact that we have the best people in the industry delivering on our brand promise to our customers every single day. and with that, i'll turn the call over to dan.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
great. thank you, glen. the team's world-class capability and continued commitment to delivering best-in-class service and reliabilities certainly sets the foundation for our financial success, and this quarter was no exception. the delta people continued to execute well through a dynamic environment.
across our teams, we are focused on preparing the operations for the next leg of the recovery, taking the steps required to position delta for the future, where we build upon our industry leadership position in years ahead. let me start with a few highlights for the september quarter. even with the pause and the pace of recovery, we achieved our goal of profitability for the quarter with earnings per share of $0.30, pre-tax profit of $216 million and margin nearly 3% on revenue of $8.3 billion. total third-quarter operating expense was $7.8 billion.
that was a 12% increase from second quarter driven primarily by nonfuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. fuel expense, $1.5 billion, increased 5% sequentially as lower fuel prices partly offset by 11% increase in capacity versus second quarter. adjusted fuel price per gallon was $1.94, was 8% lower than second quarter driven by a refinery contribution versus a loss in the second quarter. we realized 4% fuel efficiency versus same period in 2019 as we continued to capture benefits of our fleet renewal.
nonfuel costs of $6.3 billion increased 14% sequentially. that was on revenue growth of 30% driven by higher capacity, double-digit improvement in load factors. we saw a step-up in costs in the quarter to support the operational performance, higher revenue and pass-through volumes while we position for further demand recovery. the impact of these costs, combined with a network that was 30% smaller, resulted in september-quarter nonfuel casm 15% higher than 2019.
now moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. the september quarter operating cash flow was $151 million. we ended september with $19.3 billion of adjusted net debt. the pause in the pace of the recovery, along with seasonality as we transitioned out of the peak summer, resulted in a sequential decline in our air traffic liability balance of $562 million to $6.4 billion.
we expect the air traffic liability will begin to build as we enter 2022 as travel restrictions ease and more customers begin to make plans for the spring and summer season. balance sheet management remains a priority as we chart our return to investment-grade metrics in the coming years. during the september quarter, we used excess cash to reduce gross debt and interest expense while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. this includes the execution of a $1 billion tender offer, paying cash for the majority of our aircraft and commencing $500 million of incremental debt-reduction initiatives.
over the last 12 months, we've reduced our financial obligations by $12 billion. these actions drive interest savings, fund our pension, and smooth our debt maturity profile. now turning to capital and fleet. we invested nearly $620 million of capex in the september quarter.
that was below our guidance of $800 million due to timing of used aircraft delivery. our full-year 2021 gross capex is unchanged at $3.2 billion. on the fleet, we continue to build on our progress to transform and upgauge our fleet to be simpler and more efficient. being opportunistic while maintaining flexibility to adjust to the shape of the recovery is a priority.
in 2020, we accelerated our fleet renewal with the retirement of over 200 aircraft and elimination of two fleet families. we also deferred deliveries worth more than $5 billion, resulting in lower planned capex in 2020 and 2021. to capitalize on the recovery and replace retired aircraft in a capital-disciplined manner, we converted a total of 55 a321neo options to firm orders, with deliveries scheduled between 2022 and 2027 and opportunistically entered into agreements to acquire 38 gently used aircraft at compelling economics, two of which we announced today. our decisions are guided by a fleet strategy focused on simplification, scale within our fleet types, higher gauge, and sustainability.
the simplification and revitalization of fleet drive a permanent change in our cost structure with benefits estimated to be around $400 million in 2021 and around $650 million in 2022. this is compared to 2019. these savings will continue to scale in future years as we take the delivery of next-generation aircraft, restore flying volumes and further simplify the fleet. with these actions, we are unlocking efficiency gains while also improving the product and customer experience.
by next summer, nearly half our narrowbody seats will be produced by large-gauge aircraft, our most profitable fleet category. this is an improvement of 10 points versus 2019. our wide-body fleet next-generation aircraft will make up 25% of our fleet by next summer, a 15-point improvement versus 2019 that will drive efficiency gains, premium product enhancements, and expanded cargo capability. now turning to the fourth quarter.
we expect a modest loss as the recent rise in fuel prices will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the current quarter. adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.25 to $2.40. this represents an increase of nearly $0.40 per gallon from the september quarter as market prices have moved up sharply. just to remind you, a $0.05 movement in fuel equates to roughly $40 million of expense.
fuel efficiency is expected to be approximately 4% better than the december quarter in 2019. nonfuel costs are expected to increase 2% to 4% sequentially as we incur people-related costs to prepare our operations for the acceleration in demand recovery in 2022. nonfuel casm is expected to be 6% to 8% higher than 2019 in the fourth quarter. when comparing to 2019, our nonfuel cost profile is impacted by the costs required to restore our operations and how we're flying our network.
as we rebuild, additional maintenance and training costs are required to prepare our fleet and our crew to supply a larger schedule next summer. these costs will continue into next year. the size of the network and the deployment of the fleet are also contributing factors. from a scale perspective, our network is 20% smaller in the fourth quarter compared to 2019.
our mix that we're flying is also different. we have less long-haul international capacity, which is structurally low casm, given the long-stage length nature of that flying. until we are more fully restored, we expect nonfuel casm to be above 2019 levels. as our operations normalize, i'm confident in our ability to drive operating leverage and recognize the benefit from our fleet renewal.
as we look to 2022, we are optimistic about the continued demand recovery and are prioritizing driving margins, profitability, and restoring our balance sheet. i look forward to building on the team's strong track record of financial discipline and balanced capital allocation and sharing more with you on our long-term expectations and goals at our capital markets day in december in new york. in closing, as i continue to spend time with the delta people, my conviction in our future only grows stronger. during my first 90 days, i've been most impressed with the team's resounding commitment to our employees and our customers which comes through in every action i have across our operations.
it's clear to me that there's something truly special about the delta family. i want to echo ed's and glen's sentiment, thank all my delta colleagues for everything that they do to carry out our mission to bring people together and connect the world. with absolutely the best employees in the business, a clear focus on the customer, and continued financial discipline, i'm confident we are positioned to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. now with that, i'll turn the call back over to julie to begin q&a.

[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from savi syth with raymond james. 
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. and maybe this is for glen. early january is a fairly important time for booking into the rest of the year. i was curious if there is an impact on some of the forward-looking trends versus omicron just maybe only impacting kind of close-in bookings.
and also, just if there's any color on how it's impacting kind of the different -- the four different entities here.
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. i think if we could pick a period of time for an omicron variant to surge, we would probably pick this time of year because i think it's got two components that are unique to this time of year. one is these five weeks that it's impacting are five of the lightest weeks in terms of business travel; and two, as you indicated, it has really impacted more the close-in demand than the further out demand. and we believe we have plenty of time to recover those deferral of vacation bookings for summer.
if they don't come in the third or fourth week of january, it's easy for them to come sometime in february and march. so really not concerned yet about spring or summer. we feel that we'll have a very, very robust demand profile for spring and summer. and while some of the bookings have been slightly delayed, we are still seeing much -- the biggest magnitude of the impact impacting the next few weeks here.
on a regional perspective, for all intents and purposes, asia remains very constrained. we expect that to continue. and our restoration of asia through the summer is very minimal. europe, we've seen some countries imposing more restrictions.
and at the same time, we've seen some countries trying to lift restrictions. of course, you saw in the u.k., restrictions were added and they were removed. we're anticipating even further loosening of those restrictions over the next few weeks to the u.k. ireland has come out with much less restrictions.
so i think everybody is preparing at this point for the omicron to be in the rearview mirror and that travel will be much more restored for the summer than it was for any of the last two summers, and that will lead to really what we think should be very, very strong and healthy demands for transatlantic leisure travel this summer. and then latin america has continued to be more resilient. those restrictions have come off in a lot of those countries. and clearly, the short-haul latin markets are performing well, and long haul are continuing to improve.
so hopefully, that gives you the color you need.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
no, that's super helpful, glen. and i think you alluded to this as well that maybe kind of some of the operational issues should ease up heading into the summer. i know you've been hiring a lot of kind of employees and especially pilots and flight attendants since kind of the second half of last year. i was wondering if you could help provide some color on just how much like slack is being built into with these hirings as you go into the summer because your capacity levels are also coming up into the summer as well.
glen hauenstein -- president
how much slack? what do you mean by slack, savi?
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
in the sense that -- i guess i don't know if it's like employee per aircraft or just like you are hiring, but you're also increasing your capacity. so just curious if we come into the summer and if we get another variant or something like that, if we will have a little bit more kind of, i guess, reserve ratios or something like that to handle kind of the next peak period.
glen hauenstein -- president
 yeah. we're getting better positioned on staffing. we did hire a lot of people in '21 because we had a lot of people leave in '20. we're looking at hiring several thousand people in '22.
a lot of those are more longer-term flight attendants. pilots take a while to get in the pipeline and include the airline over time, but i think i'm very comfortable with our staffing levels. there's -- you can't plan in advance for something that comes up overnight, like omicron there where the world decides to shut down for 60 days. and we're going to get through this really quick, and we're going to be glad we have the staffing in place because i think it's going to be in the bookings.
to your earlier question, the bookings look very good, post-president's day, looking forward and really haven't seen a major impact at all relative to '19 expectations in that. so we think it's going to be a quick rebound.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, glen. thank you. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from andrew didora with bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. ed, maybe as a follow-up to savi's hiring question. i guess we're beginning to hear a little chatter from the regional airlines that it's becoming a bit more difficult to attract and hire new pilots.
i know these airlines often feed pilots into your airline and others. but can you maybe give a little bit of color on how many pilots you need to hire over, say, the next three years to kind of hit your capacity plans? and if regionals start to have a hard time finding new pilots in 2022, when do you think it would start to impact your and your other mainline carriers' ability to hire, if at all?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew. we're hiring at the mainline somewhere between 100 to 200 a month presently, and we expect that pace to continue for some period of time, certainly through '22 and into '23. we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but that's the pace that we're hiring at. and everyone else in the industry is hiring, too.
so it's not just delta. we are not having any problem at all at delta hiring and getting great pools of candidates. that's viewed as the premium airline that employees, in general, but particularly pilots want to come work for which we're thrilled at. but it is having the impact at the regionals, as you mentioned.
we are down flying in the first half of the year on some of the regional carriers given some of the staffing challenges we're facing, primarily because of pilot hiring. the largest regional is our own that we work with, which is endeavor, so we're working closely with them to help to mitigate some of the disruption and the churn that's going on through the process. but i think this is a normal period of time. it's -- the next order of the crisis that we've all been through is pulling through, and it's actually going to be good.
it's going to enable us to make sure that we pay good attention to the regional carriers and meet their needs. but at the same time, i'd much rather have the issue down there at the mainline. 
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. and then just one other question for me. ed, just wanted to -- you mentioned a little bit -- you talked a little bit about this at the capital markets day. but back in december, you did announce that you were putting about $1 billion of new equity capital into three of your international partners.
just wanted to get your thoughts. why do you -- why is it so important to delta to have such a large equity investment as opposed to maybe a smaller one or none at all? why is there such a focus there? i'm just curious on why you think other airlines don't follow a similar strategy. thanks.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i can't speak for other airlines. you'd have to ask them that question. but i know, for us, it's the right strategy. long term, our opportunity is international.
and when you think about growth, when you think about expansion, when you think about the natural opportunities that delta has for the future, it's going to sit in the international arena and working very closely with that. international is expensive. international is hard. international, the competitive set is very difficult.
and it's hard to do it on your own, to go out there and try to advance a u.s. airline in international borders, unless you have some really good, strong partners in the international marketplace. we're fortunate we have great partners in the international marketplace: the virgin and air france, klm and aeromexico, latam, korean, etc. but we also know that those airlines have their own objectives, and they have their own desires.
and we have found, over time, that it's very, very difficult through solely joint ventures or contractual means to try to enhance the customer experience and provide the very best quality of service if you're just trying to do it as -- through a contract as compared to being in the room, a seat in the -- inside the company, if you will, influencing the decision to ensure that we're putting our customer interest at the center of what -- because it's going to -- the growth is going to be based on customer preference. and just as you've seen, everything that we've done here domestically to grow customer preference, big opportunities for us to grow customer preference now sit in the international market. so we're thrilled with the investments we're making. we've made certain that each one of those investments pencil out on paper.
if they're good financial investments as well, we expect to generate significant returns. and candidly, given the fact that we've already made significant investments in the past, it's going to actually allow us to recoup some of that past investment easier by staying invested in the companies.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you for that, ed. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking the question, and happy new year. glen, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing sort of sequentially in terms of yields on the business in the leisure front as you kind of moved through the quarter and into the first quarter, and then specifically, kind of you look out past presidents' day, how booking activities shaping up there?
glen hauenstein -- president
we usually don't comment on future yields, but i can say that through the past quarter, while the bottom of the business yield was about minus 25, which was in the september time frame, and then that moved up to being down low single digits. and i think we talked about that at our investor day, and we were pleased with where the structure was sitting as we move forward, and i don't think anything has really changed since then. so i think that's the outlook i would give you is the -- we think the structure is fine now. we need the traffic back.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok. and then have -- do you have any updates on discussions with business travelers about their plans for budgeting travel for the remainder of the year? is there anything you can share on that front?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, absolutely. as you know, we pulse our corporate clients very often, and we did it right before investor day, and we did it right before this call. and what we saw was that the percentage of customers who thought in the first quarter that they would travel the same or more went down slightly, but it was still 80% of the corporate travel survey respondents thought they would travel the same or more in the first quarter than they did in fourth quarter. office reopenings have been pushed out, as you know.
but we are expecting, as ed indicated, when we get to spring and summer, that we'll see a robust demand for business travel as people get back into the regular routine and feel safe traveling. so really optimistic about those results and optimistic about where we think this is going to head in the not-too-distant future. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. david, this is ed. the business travel, i'd say the best way to characterize, i read, is kind of a wait and see. they're trying to understand what's going on with omicron.
they're trying to understand when their offices -- if they're not back, when they're going to open. and they're going to -- they're all making those decisions here. the good news is that, as we're watching the case counts start to crest and peak here in our country and declining in certain -- early parts of the country that had the variant hit first, that's giving them encouragement to realize that they're going to be able to get back and get their people in, open their offices sooner than maybe they were thinking when first news of omicron came. so we're in a pretty good place.
when you think about the trajectory we saw over the fourth quarter, we saw really nice growth in business, both small business, as well as big corporates. and small businesses, as we pointed out at the investor day, is something we haven't talked as much about historically, but it's just a big pool as the corporate space is for us. and then when those offices open, starting this spring, we think it's going to pick up where we left off in december and grow from there. 
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from ravi shanker with morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. morning, everyone. so just to kind of pick up on that last point, i mean, hopefully, the next few weeks is the last real disruption from the pandemic, especially with kind of availability of boosters and therapeutics and herd immunity and everything else. so if there is like genuinely like light -- like real light at the end of the tunnel, are you having conversations with the regulators on when we can fly without masks on planes and time line, say, like food service being restored in the aircraft? do you have a big guess on kind of the timing of that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i think it's premature, ravi, to speculate on masks on planes. obviously, that's going to be driven by the medical experts and not by the airlines, and we'll follow their guidance. but in terms of restoring service on planes, yes, we're doing that pretty aggressively. and over the course of the next two to three months, you're going to see our service patterns largely restored from where we were in 2019 and continue to make improvements.
and when i say restored, restored is not the right word, it's going to be improved from where we were in '19. and we've taken the opportunity during the pandemic to make substantial changes to the whole catering spec who's providing it, took ownership positions in terms of kitchens and really big change that customers are going to be delighted when they start traveling again back in the springtime, particularly internationally. it's going to be good. the thing you were mentioning about the rapid move of the variant, i agree with you.
i think that there's a real silver lining here is that since this thing is moving so fast, it's so infectious, so many people are getting it, it's going to push the pandemic into us -- into all of a normalized environment here sooner than we would have liked. so while we were together at capital markets day, we talked about the uncertainty that omicron presents. good news is that the uncertainty is going to be short-lived. and the path to normalization i think is -- we're even more confident in it when we think about our '22 numbers and travel patterns.
so it's not all negative. that's for sure. 
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and just a follow-up, forgive me if i missed this. but is there an update on what premium cabin would look like relative to main cabin in the fourth quarter? i think in the past, you've said it was running 10 percentage points ahead. and how do you expect that to trend through the year, especially as covid and national come back? thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, yes. so we're very excited about the fourth quarter results. i think it was in the comments that it was 9 points ahead of main cabin for the entire fourth quarter, and we see those trends continuing. we -- the headline for us is that premium leisure, we believe, is here to stay, and that's something that we want to continue to exploit as we think about how we service our customers moving forward and how we lay out the plans and what products and services we offer.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. hey, just two quick -- well, one quick one for dan. on the refinery, the revenue piece for the march quarter. i know normally you don't give guidance there, but it is -- it's been a big number.
it was $1 billion this last quarter. should we assume, just given where crack spreads are, that march quarter refinery sales will maybe be of a similar magnitude?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's the right way to think about it. our jet consumption will be about the same in the refinery output, so keep it consistent, yes.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. very good. and then second question to ed here. ed, i think if you look across the industry right now, i think most airlines, their pilot contracts have now been opened.
they're at an amendable point, yours included. i think one of your competitors is trying to do a quick sort of two-year type extension. can you just give us an update of where you are? and i guess, within the context, i mean, you didn't furlough anybody during the pandemic, so you're sort of maybe approaching this from a different perspective. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike. we did not furlough any employee during the pandemic, pilots included. yes, we're in a similar position, i guess, and some of our large competitors are as well, particularly relative to the pilot contract. during the pandemic, it was very difficult for any of the airlines to -- or the union, for that matter, to feel confident in projecting the future.
so i think all box across the industry were probably put on hold. but we're now getting ready to reengage, and we'll see where that goes. but no, we're not trying to do an expedited anything. we're trying to get a real contract with our people.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very good. thank you. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning. first question for glen. could you expand on your answer to savi's question that you anticipate transborder testing impediments to ease during the quarter? for example, as a move from a one-day back to a three-day testing requirement for u.s. reentering, is that specifically in your forecast? does the guidance assume that we get back to november 8 levels of sort of testing impediments? i'm only asking because, as these headlines do improve, we're going to be asked whether that's incremental to the guide or not.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i think what we've seen and -- a little more color on that is we've seen that, initially, everybody reacted by putting in some pretty onerous testing requirements. since countries that are further along with us, like the u.k. who's now on the backside of the omicron has now started relaxing those restrictions, and we've seen other countries like ireland relax, we've seen israel relax on the margin, so i think that's what we would expect. i don't think for a customer who's traveling that the one-day testing requirement that the u.s.
has imposed is that all onerous. it's pretty easy to take a proctor test with you when you travel overseas. so i couldn't speak to whether the u.s. government was going to go back to the previous policy.
but in general, i think once governments feel comfortable that they have a handle on the variant, that they have backed off and started easing the restrictions again, i think that would be something that the whole world is looking toward as we move forward here.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then for dan, the flat air traffic liability from third quarter to fourth quarter, that's pretty unusual. ordinarily, there's about a $700 million sequential decline, even in 2020. we saw a few hundred million of decline.
what should we read into that, other than strong bookings? i mean, has there been any change in how you are accounting for travel credits? and on a side note, having recently bought a delta ticket and having forgotten to apply some existing credits, i can't believe i'm the only passenger to experience this, i'm just trying to think through any implications of credit travel breakage and how that might influence the atl going forward. any color there?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
well, one, no change, right? but i think we talked about this a little bit in the third quarter call that the -- remind you that maybe historical seasonalities won't apply as you're restoring travel and the airline, and that proved to be the case in fourth quarter and what we saw. i think you're going to see a similar dynamic in first quarter. normally, that air traffic liability will grow. you've got to account for the additional restoration that you see as you progress toward second quarter that would -- that changes those seasonal impacts.
so just take that into consideration. i think fourth quarter is a good proof point that you just can't take historical practices, but it's not due to the underlying change in practice. it's really just the dynamic that's going on with the restoration of the airline and the growth.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and to your question on -- jamie, this is ed. on the question on credit, i don't know if we announced it this week or not --
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we did. good news. so we extended the expiration date through the end of '23, so you'll be fine.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
you can use it, jamie.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. i wasn't particularly worried about it. thank you. i appreciate it.
thank you, gentlemen. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. maybe just to continue on jamie's line of questioning there. can you tell us what breakage as a percent of revenue was in the fourth quarter and kind of how those trends have changed over time?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
the trends haven't changed, and they're consistent, but we don't actually give breakage to report that.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then just a broader question. as you look back at the business travel recovery you started to see in 4q, do you think that return to office is as meaningful of a guidepost relative to your initial thinking? have you seen any decoupling between return to office and business travel recovery? and it's not a -- that's not a january 13 question. that's a -- the recovery you were seeing in the fourth quarter.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think there's a correlation. a lot of business travel is triggered by going to visit companies, and the companies are closed. it makes it a little more difficult to do that.
it's not a one for one. but the fact that -- particularly the big corporates, the fact that our overall level of corporate demand, the volume return is actually fairly closely correlated, and maybe it's coincidence or not, i don't know. but the numbers are pretty tightly correlated to the amount of reopenings we've seen indicates there's a real cause and effect there, duane.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. i just wondered if we found travel has a higher utility than going back to an office but appreciate the thoughts.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes. no. we do have -- office is not the only thing. we have a lot of people traveling that aren't back into office yet.
so we have a lot of noise probably in the numbers, and there's a lot of choppiness as you -- as we navigated the course of -- it felt like two or three pandemics over the course of 2021 with the various variants. but we're continuing to make good progress. the good news is that all of our corporates are saying they just can't wait to get back to be with people and be with their own people, be with their customers, visit new opportunities and invest for the future. and i think this is going to be a strong spring and summer.
they're just waiting for the all-clear sign that you don't have to worry about a variant as you're traveling.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
makes sense. thank you. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, guys. thank you for the time. so you talked about q1 international capacity being 15 to 20 points lower than the industry. maybe can you talk about what metrics you'd like to see for that path to ramp capacity back up, how your fleet plays into it, and how you think about international capacity as we progress through the year?
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. i think we get a -- gave a pretty good outline of how we expect international restoration to occur, and what i'd say is we haven't changed from where we think we'll be in the summer yet. what we have changed is the lull season, this -- the winter iata, the remainder of the winter iata. we had some seasonal services starting up earlier than we would have otherwise done because we thought demand might be back early, and now we're taking that bet off and moving those start dates to later in the year.
and i think we still remain very, very confident that once -- as ed said, once people feel that it's safe to travel that they will. and the -- as we said in today's comments and all previous is we will remain agile. and if we don't see that developing, we'll pull it down. and if we see it coming faster, we have the ability to accelerate, to a certain extent, some growth in international.
so really, it's a -- we're still very optimistic about the summer. and we expect to be 85% to 90% restored in the transatlantic, probably less than 50% in the pacific, and largely restored in latin america. and that's what we outlined previously. we really haven't deviated from that yet. 
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and maybe just a follow-on for that. in the domestic market, you're seeing additional capacity come on with a recent order from a low-cost carrier. how do you think about the risks of supply coming into the u.s.
market?
glen hauenstein -- president
we've competed with ulccs for many, many years, and i think that's really where we came to a couple of different strategies, including our premium strategy. and i'd like to say that some of our highest-return markets historically have been straight up against lccs and ulccs, so i think we're really not afraid to compete in those markets. and we think our products stand on their own, and it is a very different product and a very different customer than they are going after.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you. 
operator
thank you. we'll hear next from conor cunningham with mkm partners.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for the time. one point from your capital markets day that i found interesting was just the domestic share gains on the corporate side during the pandemic. in the past, those gains have been somewhat minimal year over year, but you clearly used the pandemic to your advantage.
i was just curious, is there a gating factor to you growing share from here? and if there isn't, what's your expectations over the next couple of years for your share there?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
conor, this is ed. yes, you're right. we did have a meaningful and an outsized share gain, and that's among the big corporates as our corporates really focused on premium. they appreciated the work we did around blocking the middle seats for the entire length of the pandemic while it was quite active.
and what we find is when companies come to delta or customers come to delta, they tend not to leave, which is a good thing. and so the share tends to be sticky, and we work really hard to ensure that we maintain that. we've had good share gains in the past. don't get me wrong.
we have it. we kind of had plateaued at a level pre-pandemic, and we are significantly higher in share than our natural seat share is in those markets. so i think we're going to work hard to make sure we maintain. and if we can grow it, we will.
but i wouldn't expect you to see additional growth, not at that level, for the next couple of years. 
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, great. that was a big move. and then just maybe to take the other side of ravi's question and assume that there's actually going to be another wave of cases at some point. each wave has been different.
but could you just speak to lessons learned during this current wave? the reason why i ask is it just seems like your ability to work directly with your workforce actually benefited your operation relative to some of your competitors as you turned around pretty quickly.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, conor. i'm proud of our team, and it was an elatious three weeks that -- so yes, there are definitely some learnings in there, but the good news is we recovered quickly. we got the operational integrity of the airline back to where it needs to be.
it was not easy to do. but the fact that we have a very, very direct and strong, and flexible workforce that will do whatever they need to do to ensure our customers are being well taken care of and served was important, and that's shown through. one of the things that, to me, was really interesting about the last few weeks of this omicron surge is that demand was really strong. i mean, of course, it was built prior to that as it was going into the holidays, but we didn't see cancellations.
the only cancellations that were taken is because we couldn't staff the planes, but -- so the resilience of customers and their willingness and interest in getting into travel once things clear, i think, is going to be that much stronger. and each -- as each successive wave occurs, i think people are getting more used to the fact that we're having -- this is a virus we're going to have to manage and live with over time, and it's going to be a seasonal virus. it's not going to be a pandemic. and that's what the doctors all believe, and that's what i think we're going to wind up seeing here.
and we've got all the tools and the technologies and the capability and the confidence that we can manage just that.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. thanks, ed.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from myles walton with ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i was just wondering, maybe, ed, how do you think the zero-covid case policy in china plays out through the course of the year with respect to your business? i know it's a smaller piece. but just curious what you think can make them move to endemic because clearly zero-covid case policy would still be in the pandemic mode.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, that's a question, myles, that's way above my pay grade, the national policy in china. it's been interesting as we've watched a lot of the nations around the world all manage it seemingly somewhat differently. as it relates to us, you're right. china is not a big part of our network.
we'd like it to be a bigger part, but it historically hasn't been. it's going to be a pretty small part of our network, at least for the next couple of years, and we'll see beyond that. one of the things we do and we look at where we put our mettle is demand, and there's not strong demand going up between the u.s. and china now.
so i don't think it's a situation that's alarming to us. but hopefully, asia, and it's not just japan, but it's -- or china, but it's japan and other countries, hong kong and singapore, every -- they're all going to need to figure out how to move to that seasonal virus that i just talked about. and they got the tools and the technologies to manage it. i think it's just going to be a longer road.
we have a very downward feel as to growth rates in asia for some time here, and we're fortunate we've got a great partner in korean that can do that flying in the meantime for us.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and just for dan on the other expense -- nonoperating other expense for 2022, anything to throw out there in the space, whether it's interest or pension moving parts?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
no. i think you -- when you look at the total year for 2021, it was just around $900 million when you take the interest expense with the pension. it's going to be about that level, slightly above, actually. you're going to have a little less pension income.
and then that interest expense line will start to really move down in '23 and '24 as you see that adjusted net debt coming down to our $15 billion target.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
cody, we have time for one more analyst question before then moving to media q&a.
operator
thank you. i'll take our final question on the analyst side from hunter keay with wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. good morning. thank you. a couple for me.
glen, i think there was a plan. i know you have a need, obviously, with sandeep leaving. but how can scott laurence help your team? and what is it about him that you like the most when you interviewed him?
glen hauenstein -- president
listen, we don't comment on individual performance or individual reasons. but i think scott is a very well-seasoned industry executive, and i think he's going to bring us some additional value over time. we'll see when he gets here, starting next week, i believe.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then do your capacity planners talk to dr. ting when you plan the schedule?
glen hauenstein -- president
every day. 
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. 
glen hauenstein -- president
every schedule is now ting-approved.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you very much
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thank you, hunter. 
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
that will wrap the analyst portion of the call. i'll now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
cody, we have about 12 minutes for conversations with members of the media. if you would, please, just remind everyone the process to get in the queue for that. and i would remind everybody that we're going to try to keep this moving and do one question with one follow-up and end about 10 minutes after the hour, please. 
operator
absolutely. [operator instructions] i will take our first question from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
hi. good morning. i wanted to see if you could comment on of the passengers who had canceled flights during december, how many of those -- what percentage of those were able to actually complete that travel, rebook, or whatever and complete that travel during the holidays? can you talk about that percentage?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mary, this is ed. i don't have the numbers in front of me. but the vast majority of the customers that had to be rebooked, we had space that we were able to accommodate on other flights to get them to their destinations. so it's not something that we enjoy doing, but we were able to get people to where they need to be for the holidays.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
ok. so no notable or noteworthy amount of lost revenue through that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, there was, but there was flying, and some customers decided not to travel. so that's -- we estimated there was a $70 million hit for that. but no, there is not a substantial -- if customers wanted to travel on delta, we made certain we got them there.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
ok. thank you very much. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from alison sider with wall street journal.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
hi. thanks so much. you talked about sort of pandemic entering this new phase where it's becoming more seasonal, and it doesn't necessarily impact people's willingness to travel all that much. how does that change kind of the way you plan and staff for peak periods? if there's going to be a future brief but dramatic flare-up like we just saw, would you have a smaller peak holiday schedule? or how does that change kind of your planning process?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, our goal, ali, is to ensure that we're meeting customer demand, and so i don't know that we can change customers' demand and interest in traveling during peak periods or holidays, and that's when they go. and we need to make sure we're there to serve them. there are learnings from omicron, as i mentioned on the analyst call. but the -- probably the most important learning that i saw was that, even with omicron being the headline throughout the country and the disruption that the airline industry was experiencing from people getting sick from omicron, travelers are still traveling, and they were determined to travel.
they were resilient. we didn't see mass cancellations. we didn't see people deciding it wasn't -- didn't feel right. and so i think that this was another phase that we've passed through.
and who knows? is there going to be another pandemic-type virus awaiting us? there's no -- we don't know what it is, but we're also humbled by the fact we don't know what we don't know yet in this environment. but we do really believe that we're going to enter a nice period of being able to manage and create a set of normalcy around travel behaviors, particularly, but hopefully, life in general. and this virus will become very similar to what we have with the flu right now and move into a seasonal category with tools and technologies to manage. flu is a pretty significant cause of death historically.
in our country, i think we're seeing a lot less of that over the last couple of years because of the new tools and mitigations that we've learned to live with. and i think you're going to see people maybe wearing masks and then doing different things and having technologies and antivirals that they can take to help manage to -- in order to keep themselves moving. we're getting to a point where i think, ali, we're going to focus our efforts on the small percent of people that are immunocompromised that are at most at risk, but the general population is learning and willing and exhibiting an interest to live with this risk.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
thanks. 
operator
thank you. we'll hear next from leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airlines reporter
hi. good morning, everyone. just a question on hiring. can you just update us on the number of people that you want to hire? and is there any detail on perks or increased salaries that you're offering to attract workers? and if there's anywhere that you're having problems attracting workers, either workgroup or geography, i'd love to hear that.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. leslie, as you know, we hired a substantial number of people in the past year. i think it was around 9,000. we're going to be hiring less people this year.
but this number is still in the, say, 3,000 to 5,000 range, depending on how demand shapes and comes back. we're not having any meaningful impact in terms of difficulty getting people to come work for this company. regionally, yes, there are some pressure points in some of the higher-cost markets, particularly in the northeast. but no, we're doing a very, very good job of bringing the team together, and we're not having to put any unusual perks out there in order to attract talent. 
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airlines reporter
ok. thanks. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
the ability to travel free is a great perk, and we've always had that at delta.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from edward russell with skift.
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
hi. thank you. following on what leslie asked, in terms of the regional flying reductions that you're doing in the first half, what is delta doing to mitigate that?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, we've taken about 20% to 25% of our regional flying down in the first part of the year, and that is -- it stems really from flow-through pilots to the mainline, as well as getting the right people and the right training seat at the regional carriers. and i think those are the two things that we are counting on as we get to the back half of the year to resolve themselves. so i think one of the things is how many hours you have in seat? can you get trained, and can you get moved? we're working through all the details of how those transactions or transitions actually happen. and we're really pretty confident now that by the second half of this year that the pipelines will be more full, and we'll be able to restore a lot of the small- and medium-sized communities that we've had to pull down during the shortage in the first half of the year.
so we are meeting on this really daily and weekly to make sure that this actually can materialize. but right now, we feel very confident that we can catch back up again as we get to the back half of the year. 
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
ok. and one follow-on. have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result or exit any markets?
glen hauenstein -- president
we have had to exit a handful of markets. mostly, those are on prorate, so they weren't directly scheduled by delta. so as of now, things that delta had scheduled control over, we have not closed any stations, although our partners have. and what was the second part of that question?
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result?
glen hauenstein -- president
there are parked regional airplanes right now, but we expect those to return back into the sky, as i said earlier, in the second halfof the year.
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from david slotnick with tpg.
david slotnick -- tpg -- senior aviation business reporter
good morning. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to talk a little bit more about premium leisure which you mentioned at the capital markets day and again today. what does that look like in the long-haul market particularly? is that people who are able to pay for delta one? is that more affordable delta one tickets? is that a more widespread premium economy or something else?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, we've got big plans for our long-haul premium leisure sector. this year, we will be ubiquitous in introducing a new product, delta premium select, to the transatlantic marketplace. and that is really designed specifically for higher-end leisure, as well as corporate travelers whose travel policies don't include the flat-bed delta one product. so early returns on that are phenomenal, far above our expectations.
and as we get to ubiquity, we'll monitor that closely, and we'll report back to you. but we're excited about that. we're excited about the enhancements that ed talked about as we get to spring and summer on the existing premium products in the long haul. and we think we have, over the years, developed a great suite of products that fit a lot of needs for customers, whether or not it's just basic transportation and getting there safely and on time, to really more of the luxury products with the flat-bed seats and the luxurious amenities that come with that, so a wide spectrum.
and if you think of where we started, we started with just a flat bed and a coach product. so now we have a full suite of five products that we can offer in the transatlantic marketplace, and that will extend to all of our internationals by '23.
david slotnick -- tpg -- senior aviation business reporter
thank you.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
cody, we have time for one final question, please, before we have ed wrap it up. 
operator
thank you. we'll take our final question from robert silk with travel weekly.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor
good morning, guys. so i think you said you expect the pilot shortage -- or i guess the flow-through to sort of resolve itself as the year progresses. explain to me how you expect that to happen to get more people -- just to get more pilots coming back into the system.
glen hauenstein -- president
really, there are no shortage of pilots wanting to come to us or really to our regional partners. it's a matter of them getting through the training and getting into the right seat with the right number of hours. so that's what we're working through as we look to resolve the current staffing issues there is how long does that take to really catch up and when will be in a position to start growing those regional players again.
robert silk -- travel weekly -- senior editor
ok. so i guess that answers my question. thank you. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, everyone. i want to wrap up here and appreciate your time this morning. thank you for joining us. i particularly want to thank once again the delta employees for the amazing work they have done over this course of this last year, congratulate them on this special profit sharing payment which we're thrilled to be able to award them with, and realize that we're making really good progress.
omicron has been a challenging period of time, but we've learned from it. there's new findings, and one of the most important findings is that we're going to move through this thing fastly -- quickly and get to a point of stabilization, in our view. so with that, being that we are in the state of georgia, we have to close with a go dawgs, and congratulations for placing the national champions, and thank you all for joining us today.

ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie. good morning, everyone. i really appreciate you joining us today. before getting into the december quarter results and outlook, i want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the current environment.
as everyone is aware, the omicron variant has significantly impacted our people, our customers, and our operation, as well as most parts of society over the last three weeks. the combination of the rapid spread of the variant at the peak of a strong holiday demand period and in the face of extreme winter condition in parts of the country created some of the most difficult travel conditions that we ever remember experiencing. i'm incredibly appreciative of the great work that our frontline team has done and continue to do to help our customers get to where they need to be as safely and quickly as possible, no matter the circumstances. our teams have faced these difficulties head-on while also managing the impact of the virus in their own lives, and i want to thank every member of the delta team for your work during a very challenging period.
to our customers who have been affected, we appreciate your patience and your understanding. the good news is that over the past seven days, our operation has stabilized with omicron-related cancellations impacting only about 1% of our flights. and since sunday, the number of omicron-affected cancellations are around 20 a day out of nearly 4,000 daily flights. and in fact, yesterday, we only had two omicron-related mainline cancellations.
so while the new variant is not done, it appears that the worst may be behind us. based on how quickly the case counts have risen, our medical team expects cases to peak in the u.s. over the next few days, followed by a steep decline in cases, and we're already starting to see that happen among our own staff. given the high transmissibility and lower severity of omicron, this variant is likely to mark the shift in covid-19 from being a pandemic to a manageable and ordinary seasonal virus, which should accelerate the path to a normalized environment.
when we spoke last month about omicron as a risk at capital markets day, a lot was unknown. today, we know a lot more. and while the first 60 days of the year will be impacted, we're confident that the pace of travel recovery will resume its december trajectory as we move into president's day weekend and a strong spring and summer travel season are ahead of us. so as we reflect on 2021, it was a year like no other for delta.
while challenging, we made significant progress in our recovery. at capital markets day, we highlighted that our competitive strengths have deepened through the course of the past two years, and i'm extremely proud of our entire team for all their efforts. full-year revenue of $27 billion in 2021 improved nearly $11 billion or 67% from 2020 with the rate of recovery accelerating from only 25%, as measured against 2019 at the start of the year, to a close of the year of nearly 80% as we exited december. this resulted in a full-year 2021 pre-tax loss of $3.4 billion.
and while we obviously have still much work ahead of us, our pre-tax results improved by $5.5 billion versus 2020 and included a profit of around $400 million for the second half of this year. this performance positions delta as the only major u.s. airline to achieve second-half profitability and demonstrates that we have significant momentum in the continued restoration of our financial foundation. sharing our success is one of the pillars of delta's culture, which is why we are happy to announce this morning a special profit-sharing payment for all global employees.
on february 14, the vast majority of our people will receive a payment of $1,250. this is a well-earned recognition for the incredible work they have done over the past year to move our airline through the crisis and position us for recovery. turning to december quarter highlights and our march outlook. in the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $170 million.
excluding the impact of omicron disruptions, we estimate our profitability would have been approximately $250 million in the quarter. this was on revenue that was 74% recovered to 2019 levels, up 8 points from the september quarter. we started the quarter with lingering impacts to the prior variant but encouraged by the significant improvement in demand and pricing that we saw throughout the quarter in each of our passenger segments. turning to the march outlook, we expect to incur pre-tax losses in the months of january and february before returning to solid profitability in the month of march.
the omicron case surge is impacting business travel and international recovery the most. as meetings are canceled, planned office reopenings are postponed and countries put restrictions back in place. on the consumer side, we're seeing some near-term hesitation and booking behavior given the prominence of covid in our daily lives. and that, combined with operational challenges that the industry is facing, consumers are delaying travel until case counts subside and the industry operational reliability is restored.
so as a result, we're seeing the rate of recovery step down in the months of january and february to approximately 70% versus '19 levels from nearly 80% where we were in december. and while the downturn in demand has been quick, we expect an equally rapid improvement once u.s. case counts begin to decline, remain confident in a strong spring and summer travel season with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel, both domestically and internationally. we expect the month of march to return to the recovery trajectory that we were on in december, resulting in revenue recovery of 72% to 76% for the full quarter.
glen will talk in greater detail about the revenue environment, and dan will walk through our costs shortly. based on our current outlook, we expect first quarter to be the only loss-making quarter for the year, and we're confident that we'll generate a meaningful profit for the full year of 2022 as the recovery resumes and accelerates in the spring and the summer. despite the challenges of the current environment, the multiyear recovery plan that we laid out last month at capital markets day is unchanged. no one is better positioned than delta to lead the recovery as business travelers return to the skies.
delta is also uniquely prepared to benefit from the reopening of international markets which we are optimistic we will start seeing this spring as restrictions lift. our three core priorities discussed last month remain unchanged: fortifying our trusted consumer brand, restoring financial performance and foundation and building a better future for our people and our planet. as part of this, we remain firmly committed to our values and esg goals, including our commitment to fighting climate change and moving forward toward the future of net-zero aviation. we recently announced the hiring of our new chief sustainability officer, pam fletcher, the industry's only c-level cso.
pam established an impressive track record as a senior leader at general motors and has an extensive history of putting the customer first and developing products that help to enable a world free of emissions. so as we move past the final phase of the pandemic, i'm confident that we'll continue our trajectory to not only emerge stronger than before but to expand our lead in the industry and strengthen our position as the premium airline of choice in the years ahead. our ambition to transcend the -- is to transcend the industry and create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. everything we've done during this long crisis puts us closer to achieving that ambition.
thank you again. and with that, i'll turn the call over to glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
 thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. like ed, i couldn't be prouder of what the delta people accomplished during 2021, and i want to congratulate our people on their much-deserved special profit-sharing payout they'll be receiving later next month. during the december quarter, we generated $8.4 billion of revenue. this was above our expectations at the onset of the quarter driven by a strong consumer demand over the holidays.
total rasm was up 6% from the september quarter on a 7% improvement in yield. for the quarter, capacity was 79% restored versus 2019, 5 points below the industry as we maintain a disciplined approach to restoring our capacity. the strengths we've talked about last month at capital markets day are evident in our december quarter results. first, we saw a very strong demand during the holiday period.
domestic results were particularly strong with holiday prasm finishing up 8% versus 2019 and with passenger revenue more than 90% recovered. second, long-haul international trends were positive in october and november as borders reopen and restrictions lifted. this momentum stalled in the second half of december as the omicron variant resulted in more stringent restrictions and impacted our bookings. third, we saw a continued progression of business travel with domestic volumes approaching 60% restored during the december quarter.
fourth, our premium products continued to perform well. domestic premium revenue was 84% recovered versus december quarter '19, 9 points better than main cabin. fifth, our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. amex remuneration during the quarter was more than 110% restored, and cargo revenue was more than 160% of 2019 levels.
we also continued to see very strong consumer engagement with another record quarter for fly delta app downloads and sign-ups for our loyalty program. in the december quarter, we added 1.5 million new skymiles members, up 5% from 2019 levels. for all of '21, we added 5.5 million new skymiles members. this growing engagement demonstrates strong brand preference and our customers' desire to travel on delta in 2022.
as ed discussed, the recent rise in covid cases is having an impact on near-term demand and bookings. omicron has been different than previous waves. while infections are thankfully less severe in most cases, its high transmissibility is resulting in a swift increase in case counts and impacting short-term demand. with u.s.
case counts expected to peak within the next few days, we expect booking levels to rebound quickly. once case counts begin to decline, we expect revenues to rebound within 30 to 45 days. additionally, we expect some of the january and february demand decline to be recaptured in future as customers make up for canceled trips. consistent with our approach all along, we are remaining nimble and agile in how we fly our network.
for the march quarter, we expect our capacity between -- to be between 83% and 85% restored, a few points below our initial expectation. this includes a more conservative approach to long-haul international flying that we expect to be. and we expect to be 15 to 20 points lower than the industry. we have also actioned our regional capacity to ensure labor constraints at regional providers do not impact our operational integrity.
we expect these constraints will ease in the second half of the year. for 2022, we still expect our full-year capacity to be approximately 90% recovered versus 2019 with the progression weighted to the back half of the year, but this will ultimately be determined by demand. as we outlined at capital markets day last month, delta is well-positioned for the next phase of the recovery. the delta people have proven time and time again why delta is the global airline of choice.
we remain focused on improving our competitive position and extending our commercial advantages by investing in premium products, growing our loyalty ecosystem, and increasing our revenue diversification. we are confident that the demand recovery will accelerate as the variant subsides, keeping us on a path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. and with that, i'll turn the call over to dan.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
great. glen, thank you. the delta team executed well in 2021 in an environment that remains very dynamic. i want to thank our people for their hard work, congratulate them on a well-earned special profit sharing payment.
so me let start with the highlights from the december quarter. we delivered a profitable fourth quarter, reporting earnings of $0.22 per share, representing a pre-tax income of $170 million and a 2% margin on total revenue of $8.4 billion. while it was a strong close to the year, operational disruptions during the last two weeks of the quarter impacted our pre-tax results by $80 million. total fourth quarter operating expenses were $8.1 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter, driven by both fuel and nonfuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline.
fuel expense of $1.6 billion increased 4% sequentially as fuel prices per gallon increased to $2.10. total fuel expense included a $0.24 per gallon benefit from the refinery. embedded in fuel costs is a continued benefit from our fleet renewal; which supported a 4.3% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to 2019. nonfuel casm was up 8.3% compared to 2019.
this included a 1.2% impact, primarily due to lower capacity from cancellations during the last two weeks of the quarter. now turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. we generated operating cash flow of $518 million. we invested $948 million into the business, and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt in the december quarter.
we ended the year with $14.2 billion of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $20.6 billion. now on to the current environment and the march quarter outlook. as ed and glen noted, the variant is magnifying normal seasonality in the march quarter, which is our seasonally weakest of the year. the operational challenges has reduced our capacity outlook, and we now expect first quarter asms to be between 83% and 85% recovered to 2019.
this reduction is a few points from our previously expected capacity recovery. in this environment, we are also paying higher crew premiums, overtime, and covid-related costs as we work through staffing challenges, mitigation of cancellations, and protect our people. we estimate that this will impact first quarter by $60 million to $70 million. the disruptions are impacting our first quarter nonfuel casm comparison to 2019 by 3 points with the majority of that driven by fewer asms.
absent the omicron disruption, our march quarter nonfuel casm is 12% higher than 2019 as our network remains 15% smaller. the sequential step-up in nonfuel casm from december to march quarter is due to maintenance normalizing to 2019 levels. as we talked about last month, when comparing nonfuel casm to 2019, there was a 7-point benefit related to maintenance in 2021 total year due to depressed flying. this inflects to a 1-point headwind in 2022 as flying is restored.
our quarterly progression basis, the maintenance tailwind was about 5 points specifically in the fourth quarter of 2021, and there will be no benefit in the first quarter of 2022. additionally, with the asm sequentially -- essentially flat sequentially, we are not yet benefiting from the scale and efficiency. as the asm restoration progresses and we exit 2022 close to fully restored, we will realize the scale and efficiency benefit, and our comparisons to 2019 will improve. this is consistent with the framework and guidance we laid out last month at capital markets day.
underlying our 7% to 10% full-year cost guidance, we expect nonfuel casm versus '19 for the first half of the year to be up in the low to mid-teens. while in the second half of the year, averaging mid-single digits as that scale and efficiency are restored and transition costs subside. while we did not previously expect omicron-related operational disruptions, there is still a lot of the year to unfold as it equates both to capacity and demand. and we remain confident in our nonfuel casm framework and the guidance we laid out last month.
for the march quarter, adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.35 to $2.50. fuel efficiency is estimated to be approximately 6% better than the same period in 2019. when combined with our revenue outlook glen provided, we expect a loss in january and february months and a return to profitability in the month of march. now looking beyond the march quarter.
even with the challenging start of the year, we remain positioned to generate a healthy profit in june, september and december quarters, resulting in a meaningful profit for 2022. at this point in the year, we are not providing additional full-year guidance beyond the metrics given last month at capital markets day. this includes capacity at 90% restored to 2019; nonfuel casm, up 7% to 10%; and gross capex of $6 billion. the $6 billion compares to $2.9 billion in 2021 and includes $4.7 billion of aircraft capex, including delivery of approximately 70 aircraft and $350 million of modification costs.
the remainder is related to ground and technology projects. the march quarter will be our largest delivery quarter with 22 deliveries, resulting in march capex of $1.6 billion. now reducing debt remains a top financial priority. during 2021, we reduced gross debt by $6 billion, fully funded our pension on a pension protection act basis with a $1.5 billion contribution and a 16% return on our planned assets.
in 2022, we have $1.8 billion in debt maturities with $1.2 billion in the current quarter. with a heavier capex quarter, we expected adjusted net debt to increase to $22 billion in the first quarter. as we achieve sustained cash generation over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment-grade metrics and making progress toward that $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. so in closing, at our recent capital markets day, we outlined our financial priorities and our recovery path over the next three years.
the power of the brand, the strength of the competitive advantage give us strong conviction in the trajectory and the path to full financial recovery. so with that, let me turn it back to julie for q&a. 
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, dan. cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and go to our first question?

operator
absolutely. [operator instructions] and we'll first hear from mike linenberg of deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
oh, hey. good morning, everyone. fantastic outlook. i guess, i want to focus on capacity with -- so my question is to glen.
look, you operated 83% of 2019 in the march quarter and things have obviously gotten a lot better for the june quarter. i mean i just sort of think about the omicron impact in january and february, it was pretty impactful. and yet we're just moving up one point sequentially, 83% to 84%. so i guess, glen, is this as much driven by the fact that it's all about maintaining operational reliability and really just running the best schedule that there is and that will drive not just the revenue premium, but overall revenue and less reaccommodation costs? and i guess as a sort of corollary to that question, are you watching what's going on over in europe and seeing how several european carriers are being forced to cancel because of the spread of this other variant and so you guys want to make sure that you're just well prepared and well reserved?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think it's all of the above. i think you asked and answered your own question there. you did a great job of articulating our viewpoint is the priority is to operate reliably and the other priorities do not get ahead of demand. so this is a very recent demand increase that we've seen.
the uptick just started about six to eight weeks ago, in late february and march. and so as we get through the year, if these demand trends continue, we have the opportunity to take another tick-up or we could pivot in a different direction if warranted. but i think, it has made it very clear to us that being nimble until we get to the very end of this is the key to our success. and i think we've done a very good job as a company being nimble in our offering throughout the pandemic and really been closest to actual demand if you look back at what demand was.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. we and investors love the discipline. thanks.
operator
next, we'll hear from catherine o'brien of goldman sachs.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thanks so much for the time. so maybe a bit of a follow-up to mike's question.
i've been hearing from some of your peers and other industry folks that labor supply is continuing to wait down on the ability to ramp up capacity. and as we enter 2q, labor might actually be a bit tighter than we thought at the beginning of the year, just given omicron-driven training delays and higher attrition rates. i guess, first, are you seeing the theme at delta? and if so, did that impact your 2q capacity plans versus your plans back investor day at all? thanks.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, catie. this is ed, i'll take that. we've been at this for the better part of the last 18 months getting ahead of it. and we hired over 10,000 people last year.
we hired another 4,000 people already this year. so we've hired 15,000 people. and we are largely where we need to be on staffing. yes, pilots have a training pipeline and it will take some time before pilots are fully in category and where we want them positioned.
it'll probably take another year or two. flight attendants, likewise, we're hiring flight attendants and there's a queue as to how much many people we can put through the training pipeline. but that's not where the real congestion is. it's in the airport, it's on the ground experience, it's making sure we have our suppliers ready and positioned.
one thing we did last year, really almost two years ago now, is we took over a lot of the functions at the airport that had been outsourced, catering, cleaning, wheelchair pushing. and we have delta people in position, and we've hired delta people to do it to make certain that we get the best experience for our customers. and you know what? not only are people doing a much better job at it, we're also doing it much more efficiently and effectively and customers are appreciating it. so the labor situation, you're right, has changed pretty dramatically over the course of the last two years.
we've been out ahead and that's why you look at our operational stats over that time frame, we've led the industry consistently.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's great. and maybe just a quick one for glen. the mx remuneration is a bright spot again this quarter. but would i be correct to think maybe omicron created some noise at the start to the q and then we see that accelerate even further as we move through the year? i know you just reiterated your goal that you said at investor day for $5 billion-plus contribution this year.
but if we do see an acceleration from 1q, might still be some upside to that. and thanks again for all the time. congrats.
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i think we're always hopeful for upside. i think what we're excited about when we dissect the spend is that you can really see the spend moving from goods to services and particularly increases in the airline spend on the card. so those are very encouraging statistics for us to continue to monitor as we move through the year.
but i think you've really seeing that as the moving away from goods and the movement toward experiences and services.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
anything further, catherine?
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
no. that was it from me. thank you so much for the time.
operator
next, we'll hear from brandon oglenski of barclays
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, and thanks for taking questions. glen, you provided an update. i think you said domestic corporate travel 70% recovered and international 50% in march.
can you just give us some insight on how those bookings are shaping up here early in 2q? and then second to this question, how much do you think the international testing requirement is holding back trips across the atlantic right now?
glen hauenstein -- president
first, i'll answer the second first. i think that is the next leg up that we see in the demand set, and we think we have very quite robust demand. but there certainly is, in the minds of some consumers, some hesitancy to go abroad and risk being caught, not being able to get back because of catching covid. so hopefully, we can see that roll back in the next few weeks here.
i think the â we are hearing good signs from washington. we'll see, hopefully, that comes out here. and that would be one of the final things that we would need in place for us to really say that covid is in our rearview mirror. so hopefully, that happens.
and then your second question was what, i'm sorry.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
i think -- when you were talking about, i think, domestic corporate travel at about 70%, international at about 50% in march, can you give us any insights into how that's improving in 2q?
glen hauenstein -- president
absolutely. and i think the one that we're really excited about right now is transatlantic business which for the first time last week crossed domestic restoration in terms of volume. and so that was a big improvement from where we had been just six or eight weeks ago. so it does look like transatlantic business is returning robustly, and that's very exciting for us.
and i think what we're also excited about is this survey that we just got back that said 90% expect to travel more in 2q than they did at 1q. so i think when we report to you next quarter, we'll see both of those numbers continuing to move up. and of course, the big question mark is when will japan and china reopen? and that's probably not in this next quarter and hopefully sometime this fall, but that's a little bit further out. what i would say is when these countries are open, business returns quickly.
so to korea, to australia, we've seen very rapid increases in business demand as those countries have opened.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
operator
next, we'll hear from helane becker of cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. thank you for the time, everybody. so just a couple of questions on the cost side of the equation, i know, there's not a lot you can do about fuel. but on the labor cost side, to attract people, i mean, i think, ed, you said you're not going to have to hire that many more people this year.
but to retain people, are you finding that you have to raise salaries more than the 4% that you've already slated for may first?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, helane. no. we're not. one of the great things about our brand is throughout this period we've been able to attract and bring in the 15,000 people i talked about with fundamentally not having to change the scales we've used in select high-priced markets, some sign-on bonuses, very judiciously.
but fundamentally, no, our scales are intact and the 4% increase may 1st helps.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then my other question is like kind of unrelated, but i think -- i feel like, it was glen who mentioned that you saw a record cargo number in march, i want to say. so i'm thinking about what you're carrying and what you're seeing in air freight rates and why you think it was so strong and whether that can continue into the second quarter, and if it's meaningful.
like 18 questions in there, glen.
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, clearly, we know about supply chains trying to catch up. and clearly, airfreight has been one of the ways to relieve that pressure. and so we've seen airfreight rates continue to move in a favorable direction.
i'd say the one caution i have right now is the closure of china. and china has been, of course, a very strong, strong market for us in the cargo area. and with shanghai closed and we're literally not flying to china right now until shanghai reopens, so that's going to weigh a little bit on cargo revenues as we move forward. but as that does reopen, then you can see that pent-up demand for goods that need to get shipped out of china and potentially even another leg up.
so i'd say, we're in a temporary pause right now because of the issues in china, but i expect, as china comes back online, and i don't know the exact date, i don't think anybody does, but we could see an even stronger demand coming out of that.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
off a good year last year.
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. off a great year last year.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst

operator
conor cunningham, mkm partners.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for the time. you've really invested in the operation over the years and just the customer experience in general. and maybe this is a follow-up to what mike was getting to.
just, there's been a lot of meltdowns around you. and i'm just curious on how you, as delta, go after those customers that have maybe been displaced by another airline. i think about like boston this past week and just curious on how you attract them and make them permanent delta passengers.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, conor. i think, again, throughout the pandemic, we have, as glen said, been the most disciplined in the return of supply and have -- probably have a better match to demand than anyone else. and it's been interesting to watch because a lot of airlines have taken different approaches over the course of the last two years. fundamentally, our commitment and our promise to our customers is to give them a great, safe, on-time, reliable experience, and we continue to invest more and more in the premium categories of our aircraft, of our service elements, and the quality of our -- of the service that our people drive and it speaks for itself.
we take, very humbly, the various awards we've won over the course of the last couple of years. i think we've expanded our leadership during covid. we had the most to lose, and i think we gained the most over that time frame, candidly. and we've got some really nice momentum as we're bringing and opening new airports.
we've got the new laguardia opening in june, which will all be very pleased to be the new lax that we cut the ribbon on with the mayor a couple of weeks ago and the new international facility in seattle and continued expansions in salt lake and improvements in minneapolis, many other places. so we're going after the customer experience on the ground as well as in the air with a heightened focus on premium. that's about all we can say.
operator
myles walton, ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. there are some concerns about looking forward potential consumer softening through the course of the year. and obviously, you're not seeing that in 2q.
but i was wondering, ed, if you're looking for signals of softening in your business, do you think it would sort of start to show up first in a lower uptake of premium products? show up first in maybe leisure roads, demand drying up there or somewhere else. maybe you can just talk to what you'd look for in your watchtower.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, you're right, myles. we're not seeing it. but at the same time, we acknowledge our crystal ball is only as good as the next 60 to 90 days or whatever we have in terms of kind of a decent build of bookings on hand. and certainly, the next 60 to 90 days look good, as evidenced by our guidance.
so we expect a very strong summer coming through that. consumer -- the health of the consumer is something we spend a lot of time talking about and watching and looking at. but there's other elements at play here with respect to the consumer. one is that consumers have not been traveling over the last two years.
so this is a category that they're prioritizing as they're looking at where their spend is going into travel. you see it in credit card data, you see it all across the board. and this is not just true at delta, this is true within our industry. hotels are seeing it, rental car companies, et cetera.
people are looking for experiences. you're seeing a pretty significant shift coming out of goods and retail into experiences and services. and that's not just the fact that people haven't traveled, they've also saved money as they've accumulated some meaningful cash and discretionary income for what they have been doing over the last couple of years. so we feel pretty strongly that we're going to continue to see the strong demand extend beyond just the normal summer surge but into the fall.
at the same time, we're watching it. i think the place we've been looking for is pricing resistance. when we start to see pricing, particularly with high input costs like fuel, starting to challenge our demand and supply assumptions, then we'll take the next step-up. for now, we're feeling cautiously bullish about the summer.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. great. thank you.
operator
next, we'll hear from duane pfennigwerth of evercore.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning. glen, if i could, on your commentary on yields improving sequentially through the balance of 2q, i assume that is based on what you're seeing in advanced book yields.
can you just comment on like when you add it all up, not just advanced book yields but also bookings, how would you characterize kind of your visibility into may, june versus a normal time? is it also running ahead? i mean it's not as snarky as a question as it sounds. i guess my question is, as you offer higher fares out into any pushback, or are you seeing any hesitancy?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i'd say absolutely not. as a matter of fact, we've been trying to catch up to this robust demand. and our quest in the revenue management team, who i think has done an excellent job in managing this surge, is to not run out of seats as we get toward the peak travel, summer travel season. so we want to have reasonably priced offers in market right up to day of departure and we don't want to be running out of seats.
having said that, we are running ahead in terms of absolute bookings domestically in the rest of the quarter. and so we're actively managing that down a little bit so that we don't run out as we get very close to departure date. so i hope that gives you some color as to what we're looking at right now. but we're, right now, in the mode of trading traffic for yield.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. and then i don't know if we've seen enough of kind of an off-peak environment yet here in 2q, but can you contrast for us how are you seeing sort of peak yield improvement relative to 2019 versus off-peak yield improvement? are you starting to see any, i guess, torque on off-peak? thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
no. as a matter of fact, when you look at where we're booked ahead, we have had the offers slightly ahead in peak days and peak travel periods versus off-peak. and we've seen the consumer demand that you would expect, travelers moving into the off-peak period, but at higher yields. so really, really encouraged by what we see as we head into late spring and summer and we'll see how it actually materializes.
but everything we see right now points to a very, very robust travel through the remainder of spring and summer.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you, glen. excellent.
operator
next, we'll hear from jamie baker of j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. good morning. glen, a question on premium revenue. what percent is sold at the initial time of ticketing as opposed to during the window between ticketing and departure? and how has that changed over time?
glen hauenstein -- president
we have moved more and more to ticketing, time of ticketing. so i'd say, and i don't have these numbers, i can follow up with you, but my guess is that they're around 70% is done at time of ticketing and about 30% post-purchase.
operator
andrew didora of bank of america. andrew, your line is open, if you can release your mute function.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. can you hear me?
operator
we can hear you now.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
glen, i know it's really early on in the corporate travel recovery, but we've been hearing from some hotel companies that the corporate booking curve has just shortened tremendously. i think they've been mentioning under two weeks versus normally 30 days to 45 days. are you seeing a similar shortening in the corporate booking curve? and i guess, are you beginning to see any other changes to the way corporates behave here as the recovery unfolds. thanks.
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i would not say that we're seeing that same phenomenon. our corporate booking seems -- outside of 21 days now, seems to be trending similarly inside of 2021. so i'd say we're seeing very normal booking curves in terms of business.
and i think what we're seeing, and this is more anecdotally than you see in the type of transaction you have, but people's reason for traveling for business is slightly different. we are seeing an increase in meetings, an increase in groups, and i think that may be why hotels are seeing further out aps because it's harder to get big blocks.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
april, can we please go to the next question.
operator
savi syth of raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning. hello, everyone. just a quick follow-up to, i think, brandon's question earlier.
so just if you look at the 2q guide, what's the level of demand recovery that's reflected in that guide? business demand.
glen hauenstein -- president
the business demand is in the low 70s.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. got it. and then just switching a little bit to the regional airline segment. you started a transition in that segment getting back to, i think, 2012.
and kind of accelerated here during covid. i was just curious if you kind of view the kind of the pilot supply issues of the regional industry are facing, are those kind of transitory, or is there a need to revisit the regional airline strategy at delta?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, savi. yes, there is certainly a challenge to the business model that the regionals are experiencing. and you're right, we've moved pretty aggressively to transition out of the lower category, the 50-seat regional jet, over the last 10 years. so as a result of that, we have less lift coming out of the regional in terms of aggregate shelves and pilot requirements and staffing obligations than some of our other competitors in the industry.
they were down to less than 150-seat regionals, probably meaningfully less, at the present time and we don't intend to grow that. it's going to continue to drop. it's a reset period. i think everyone is dealing with their partners in a certain way.
certainly, it's driving up costs on the pilot side, to keep the pilots in the regional category until we're ready to bring them up to the main lines. but fundamentally, it's still a good business for us. we've got a considerable investment in it, and we're going to do our best to continue to grow it, but not at the lower category. we're happy with our 76-seat product.
and to the extent, we can get more of those, we would.
operator
next, we'll hear from david vernon of bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey. good afternoon or good morning. dan, i appreciate the color of the incremental cost guidance, i think we can back into what that number looks like in absolute dollar terms. could you give us some sense of what are the risks and upside, downside risks achieving that cost guidance? do we need international to really kind of reopen on some set schedule, or do you feel pretty good about where we're going to be? and then as a follow-up, as you think about 2022 to 2023, given that we've hired ahead, as ed had mentioned, resourcing the network, bringing people in, getting the training up, how should we think about that incremental cost in absolute dollars for the next 5% of capacity relative to what we're seeing in the back half of this year? not looking for guidance, just trying to get a sense for how we think about -- or how we should be thinking about that cost build from 2022 to 2023 given the hiring ahead of this demand recovery that we've seen at delta.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah. the -- so when you think about it, related to it, the biggest risk when you think about the step-up and step-function change that we talked about an opportunity ultimately comes back to capacity. and it's the asms that we fly. and so that is the -- and you saw that, as we talked about the first half, we're two points lower on capacity and that translates us to being higher than where we thought we'd be.
so put that out there, that's the biggest element of it. that's two-thirds of three-quarters of it. the other quarter of it is driving the efficiency, it's the efficiency in the aircraft, it's the efficiency in the airport, and facilities and the people, but the biggest one is related to the restoration of asms. we're building this to be back restored and it's a progression of that.
so we think we're -- when we set the multiyear framework, if you go back to that capital markets, said where we'd be this year, would be 7% to 10%, we'd be low to mid-single digits as it relates to 2023 and then very low single digits as it relates to 2024. that again has you stepping up to being 100% restored in that period of time. so you really have, at that point in time, all that transition expense that we've talked about just now has been sunset, your pull through the restoration, now you're getting the real benefit of running it at 100%.
operator
ravi shanker of morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. just a follow-up on the previous commentary on the 1q to 2q transition, i mean, obviously, your 2q guidance is pretty strong. is it fair to say that the kind of extreme peaks that we saw in the back half of 2021 juxtaposed by extreme troughs between it, kind of that is in the past? so when you think of a spring break to summer travel transition, you're not going to see as much of a trough in between those peaks? is that because of corporate? and kind of what does that mean for your network reliability and your abilities around the airline?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i think one of the issues is moving out of covid, we probably will not run the peaks as peaky as we had in the past in order to create more efficiency in the network on a year-round basis. and i think we've really come -- we've instituted a lot of plans in that space to try and ease out some of the peakiness of our operational schedules. and i'll give you an example is, historically pre covid, we operated about 20% more widebodies in the summer than we did in the winter. so when you think about the way that we utilize our pilots or our flight attendants in those categories, that they had very easy rosters in the off-peak and very tensed rosters in the peak.
and what we've been really working on during covid is to come out of this with a more deseasonalized network, so we can improve the asset utilization, flatten out the peaks and build up on the troughs. and we spent a lot of time thinking about that and creating it. and i think as we get to the fall and winter schedules, you'll see how we've dealt with that. i don't want to talk about that right now in detail, but i think those are the real things that we're looking at doing.
operator
next, we'll hear from sheila kahyaoglu of jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. it's sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies. can you maybe talk about your pricing strategy in this inflationary environment? how you've managed it, how that's changed.
and then how you've seen the impact to load factors? i think you said in an earlier question, demand hasn't changed. but obviously, for q2, the guidance for capacity is still 16% below 2019 level. so maybe can you talk about how you're managing all that in?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i mean, we don't talk about future pricing as a rule, so we'll stay away from that subject. and i'd just say that when you have stronger demand, you clearly have opportunities on the margin to improve the offer in the marketplace and see if consumers respond to that. and that's really what we've been doing as fuel prices have continued to run up and demand continues to remain strong.
so those levers alone have gotten us to where we feel very comfortable about the 2q revenue environment.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
sheila, did you have another question? i'm sorry. that will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. i'll now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
good morning, everybody. april, if you wouldn't mind reminding everybody about how to ask a question. and we have a lot of energy in the room, if we want to keep the pace of these moving, we'll try to knock out as many of these as possible.
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll first hear from leslie josephs of cnbc.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
hi. good morning, everybody. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the union drive of your flight attendants. there's been a lot of attention on other companies like amazon and starbucks.
do you expect your flight attendants to be unionized this year? and what is the impact on delta? do you think it helps or hurts your recruiting? and then my second question, are you still charging $200 a month additional for unvaccinated employees' health insurance? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, leslie, on the question with respect to labor and union, this is not new at delta. we've been the unions for many, many years looking at the delta employees and have been actively seeking their support. so we, on the one hand, absolutely support our employees to make the best interest -- the best decision that's in their best interest. but at the same time, we know historically that the employees of delta have been best served by having the direct relationship with our leadership.
so we don't -- this is not anything new or different. it's really more of the same. so i wouldn't read too much into what the -- what's going on at amazon or starbucks or other places and try to equate that to delta. it's a very different situation.
and we've dropped as of this month the additional insurance surcharge given the fact that we really do believe that the pandemic has moved to a seasonal virus and any employees that haven't been vaccinated will not be paying extra insurance costs going forward.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
thank you.
operator
and next, we'll hear from alison sider of wall street journal.
alison sider -- airline reporter
hi. thanks so much. just curious what your take is on all the discussions of consolidation among some of the midsized airlines without asking you to comment any specific deal that may or may not happen. just how would that sort of change the competitive landscape if you did start to see more consolidation among some of these carriers?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
ali, that's a really good try, but we're not going to bite on that either.
alison sider -- airline reporter
ok. thanks.
operator
next, we'll hear from david koenig of associated press.
david koenig -- business reporter
hey. good morning. glen, you said you were hearing good signs, as you put it about washington perhaps rolling back the pre-departure test requirement. what exactly are you hearing and from whom? and i guess i'd ask the same question about the mask mandate.
glen hauenstein -- president
maybe i'll turn that over to peter, our chief legal officer.
peter carter -- chief legal officer
we were obviously engaged throughout the administration, and i will tell you that we are getting a strong indication that the testing, the pre-departure testing will be phased out in the near future which is, of course, quite encouraging.
operator
dawn gilbertson, usa today.
dawn gilbertson -- consumer travel reporter
hi. good morning. two questions. first for glen.
there are a lot of questions about pricing resistance. and just a quick check of your fares for a july trip showed $1,500 round trip from atlanta to maui, $750 from lax to orlando. are a lot of americans going to be priced out of vacations this summer? and do you fear any backlash? that's my first question. and the second one is, ed, you mentioned at the top of the call about travelers' patience? where are you still seeing issues? and how long before -- i mean, how long will travelers put up, say, with long waits on the phone and other ways to reach you guys? thank you very much.
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. we haven't seen a lot of resistance to the price points that we have in market, and our goal is to have reasonable price points in market up to day of departure. and as we head to the peak, there are going to be constraints on peak days. and so as you shop around, if you're looking for lower fares, you have to be flexible in terms of which days you'd be willing to fly.
but as we sit today, we have a load factor cushion versus where we sat in 2019.so we have a higher percentage of our total seats already booked which is, of course, putting a little bit of pressure on the ones we have remaining to sell in terms of increasing the offers on the margin. so look, my advice to travelers is to book early and be flexible if fares are your most important attribute. but what we're seeing more and more is that that is not the only attribute. the quality of service and that level of service counts more and more.
so i hope that answered your question.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and, dawn, on the question to reservation specifically, if that's what you were asking. we have continued a very, very aggressive drumbeat of hiring in reservations to the point we're now over 50% of our total employees and reservations have been hired just within the last couple of years and we're continuing to grow that. and as our people are getting more experienced and more comfortable, the service levels continue to improve. and we've also invested aggressively in our digital self-service options where, several years ago, maybe only 20% of the reasons people would call us could -- they could actually manage it digitally through self-service channels.
today, that's over 60% of the reasons people call us can be handled digitally. and people are continuing to expand and the adoption of self-service is growing substantially. obviously, as demand has surged, that continues to put more pressure on the phones. as international is opening, that puts more pressure on the phones.
but on balance, our phones are generally even -- and we allocate based on the level of service and the dial-in category, they get responded to the quickest. but on average, the wait times in the phones are less than 30 minutes.
glen hauenstein -- president
i'd just make one -- the number of transactions that you could actually complete on digital is in the low 80s. the adoption rate is in the low 60s. so continuing to push people. and since you have a direct line to the consumer is encouraging, continue to encourage them to seek a digital answer first rather than calling and waiting on the line because most -- only very complicated transactions now can't be handled digitally.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
with that, april, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to ed, please.
operator
absolutely. our final question will come from niraj chokshi of the new york times.
niraj chokshi -- business reporter
hi. thank you. i just had two questions on fuel. first, i was wondering if you could speak to the effect of the higher cost of fuel could have on fares.
and the other is if there's anything more you could add about sort of the role that refinery playing and helping to offset that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'll take the first question, and dan can talk to the refinery. it's really a function of demand. to the extent we continue to see very, very strong demand for our product, our ability to push on not just the increased cost of fuel, but all of our cost inputs, we're shortening the time lag between when we experience that cost and when it's in the pricing structure. but it's really a function of demand more so than any decisions that we take on our own.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
and then related to the role of refinery as it relates to managing the fuel. 20% of the refinery production is jet, and that jet fuel goes to our new york operations. so it is a direct hedge as it relates to the spreads associated with that. so it's really 100% hedged as it relates to how we run our operations and what it provides.
the rest of the 80% production is diesel and gasoline as you go through that process. and so that provides a partial hedge related to diesel and gas to jet. and so by and large, the refinery when you think about in aggregate as it relates to spreads, it's about a 40% to 50% hedge as it relates to our fuel costs.
niraj chokshi -- business reporter
thanks. and just on fares, last month at the jpmorgan conference, glen had given an estimate that delta would need to recover, i think, it was 15% to 20% each way on a $400 round trip average. are you able to kind of provide any update on that kind of figure given the higher fuel costs now?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
this is ed again. we -- fares are all over the place, they move every day and fuel prices move every day, so we're not going to track to any specific comment. i think you heard in our remarks that we're actually seeing in pricing today real-time coverage for where fuel costs are.
operator
and now at this time, i'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, i want to thank you all for joining us. we are thrilled with the performance of our team, the progress we've made in terms of serving the demand that is returning, we've been waiting for two years to see this, and we're ready to go, customers are ready to go, and we look forward to a very, very strong spring and summer season and look forward to speaking to you all in july when we can report on the second-quarter results. everybody, have a good day. thanks for joining us today.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines march quarter 2022 financial results conference call. my name is april, and i will be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. and i would now like to turn the call over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, april, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for our march quarter 2022 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today are our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our cfo, dan janki. ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy.
glen will provide an update on the revenue environment. and dan will discuss cost fleet and our balance sheet. after the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask -- please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. and after the analyst q&a, we will move to our media questions.
today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted.
you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us today. before we begin, i want to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in ukraine.
we are proud to have raised the ukrainian flag at our global headquarters in atlanta in solidarity with the people of ukraine. at delta, we've provided meaningful financial and operational support to assist the people of the region in connection with our partnership through the international red cross. this morning, we reported march quarter results, marking another important step forward in our recovery. we generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter and a 10% operating margin in the month of march.
our revenue recovery in the march quarter reached 79% of 2019 levels, five points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guidance. as expected, january and february generated operating losses. as omicron receded, we saw a surge in demand, supporting an inflection to a solid profit in the month of march. delta continues to provide best-in-class operational, customer, and financial results in a dynamic environment.
this results from the dedication, professionalism and hard work of delta's more than 75,000 people worldwide. restoring capacity during a period of rapid demand recovery has proven challenging for all of us in the industry but delta people continued to lead the way, i want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we navigate the challenges of ramping up operations into the peak travel period. and i know, our teams have been working incredibly hard, and i want to thank all of them for what they're doing for our customers and for each other. we rewarded our people with a special profit-sharing payout in february based on the second half of 2021 profitability and announced a 4% pay increase that's going to be effective may 1.
these actions align with delta's long-standing values of shared success with our people. with the rebound in demand, the month of march was the best cash sales month in delta's history, outpacing our prior record from spring of 2019 despite offering 10% fewer seats. in march, we had our first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019, and we achieved record co-brand acquisitions, co-brand spend, and cargo revenue. domestic consumer revenues are exceeding 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel, revenue has accelerated as offices reopen and business travelers rebuild face-to-face relationships.
demand for long-haul international is growing, as travel restrictions lift, led by the transatlantic. to date, we have not seen an impact to travel demand from the conflict in ukraine, but we, of course, are monitoring this closely. nearly all european countries have now removed entry testing requirements for vaccinated customers. we continue to join the rest of the us travel industry, in urging the us government to lift pre-departure testing requirements.
as we prepare for the peak summer season, we continue to be very focused on operational readiness. with 4,000 new members joining the delta team already this year, we feel good about our staffing and our ability to meet demand as we continue to restore the airline. our customers are seeing the benefits of our ongoing investments to improve the travel experience. this spring, we are opening new, modernized terminals in los angeles, laguardia, and seattle.
these generational investments enhance delta's already leading positions in key hubs and provide an elevated ground experience for our customers. we continue to upgrade our fleet, recently taken delivery of our first airbus 321neo. the state-of-the-art aircraft is scheduled to begin service may 20 from boston to san francisco and features our new domestic first-class seat design, with nearly one-third of the seats in premium cabins and improved fuel efficiency, this will be the best aircraft we fly for our customers and generate the highest returns for our owners. our strategic decision to accelerate investments in our airports, our fleet, and our technology during the pandemic will benefit delta and our customers for years to come.
as covid shifts from a pandemic to a manageable seasonal virus, there are clear signs of pent-up demand for travel and experiences, as consumers' spending shifts from goods to services and experiences, travel restrictions lift and business travelers continue to return to the skies. against this improving backdrop, we are building momentum in the june quarter, with expectations for a 12% to 14% operating margin and strong free cash flow despite higher fuel prices. our revenue recovery is expected to reach 93% to 97% of the 2019 levels, with double-digit unit revenue improvement. we are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel.
this is occurring almost in real time, given the strong demand environment as well as delta's growing brand preference, our premium product focus, and measured approach to capacity. while we are confident in summer demand and the capacity plans that we have in place, given macro uncertainty, we will remain nimble on capacity for the second half of the year and continue to prioritize sustained profitability. i'd like to pause and put that q2 guidance into perspective. at 12% to 14% operating profit, we are only four points behind our june 2019 quarterly operating margin, and that's despite fuel prices being up 50% from that time period and our capacity only 85% restored.
so we are greatly encouraged by the momentum we are seeing, and we remain confident in our outlook for meaningful full-year profit for 2022. as we take note of these achievements, i'm pleased with the progress we're making across the three core priorities we laid out at capital markets day last december. first, we continue to fortify our trusted consumer brand, demonstrated by loyalty and record engagement with our customers. the strength of our brand has never been greater and has been recognized by the wall street journal, fortune, business travel news, and many, many others.
and our customers are taking note that our net promoter scores consistently above 2019 coming out of the pandemic. we intend to build on the momentum we gained over the last two years.second, we are restoring our financial performance. as revenue improves and we regain a competitive cost structure, we're returning to profitability, generating strong free cash flow, and making progress on debt repayment. and our third priority is building a better future for our people and our planet, including our ongoing commitment to creating a sustainable future for aviation.
we are continuing to invest in the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our people while prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the company. our mission of connecting the world has never been more important than it is today, and i'm as confident as ever that we'll achieve our ambition for a leading consumer brand to transcend the industry and deliver financial outcomes that create significant and resilient long-term value for all of our stakeholders. it's been an encouraging period of recovery, and it's exciting to see our customers returning to the skies. thank you again.
and with that, i'll turn it over to glen to update the revenue environment.
glen hauenstein -- president
thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. with robust demand, growing preference for the delta brand, and quick actions to recapture higher fuel prices, we achieved significant milestones in the month of march and have momentum as we head into the summer. none of this would be possible without our people, and i couldn't be prouder of the delta team and the results that they are delivering. a huge thank you to all.
during the march quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of revenue. this was approximately $500 million higher than our initial guidance in january, resulting in a revenue recovery of 79% compared to 2019. we continue to execute a disciplined approach to keeping capacity in line with demand. for the quarter, capacity was 83% restored versus 2019 and at the low end of our initial guide and below the industry.
the quarter was a tale of two halves. while omicron depressed demand in january and early february, we saw an unparalleled demand recovery from presidents day on. our revenue recovery versus 2019 progressed from 70% in january to approximately 80% in february to 85% in march, with momentum building into april. march was the first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019 with prasm up 1% and trasm up 3%.
premium products once again led the way with domestic premium revenue approximately 100% restored to march of 2019 levels. we also achieved our highest ever monthly cash sales, as ed mentioned, our highest direct sales, highest co-brand acquisitions, highest co-brand spend and highest cargo revenue in the month of march. business travel volumes reached the highest post-pandemic levels we've seen and, importantly, in march, corporate fares inflected to positive versus 2019 for the first time. this drove an acceleration in the recovery of business revenues with improvement in both corporate contracted customers and small and medium-sized enterprises.
as we exited the quarter, domestic corporate sales improved to approximately 70% recovered versus 2019, and our recent survey results show that 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the june quarter as offices continue to reopen. additionally, we are seeing more corporates implement changes to travel policies. for example, domestic travel restrictions have been completely removed for all of our top corporate accounts. and increasingly, corporates are allowing upsells to premium cabins and refundable products.
strength in cash sales and seasonality drove a $2.8 billion sequential increase in our air traffic liability. the increase in advanced ticket sales outpaced normal seasonal trends, resulting in an atl balance of $9.1 billion at the end of march, up from $6.6 billion in march of 2019. we expect the atl will continue to build in the june quarter, albeit at a slower rate than what we saw in the march quarter. for the june quarter, we expect revenue recovery versus 2019, as ed mentioned, to improve to 93% to 97% on 84% capacity restoration.
this reflects a low double-digit trasm growth versus 2019, with all entities expected to post positive unit revenues compared to 2019, except for the pacific. we expect april yields to be up double-digits compared to 2019 with further strengthening as we approach june, positioning us to successfully recapture a significant portion of the higher prices -- fuel prices in the june quarter. geographically, domestic and latin revenues continue to lead the recovery, and fewer restrictions in major international markets are unlocking demand for long-haul travel. we expect a very strong summer in the transatlantic based on demand trends.
and in the pacific, we are encouraged by the opening of australia, south korea, and other countries in southeast asia. when countries reopen, we see a rapid restoration of demand. for example, following south korea's border opening on april 1, we expect load factors to improve from the low 50s in march to the low 90s by june. we expect that heavily restricted regions, such as china and japan, will continue to put pressure on overall pacific unit revenues until borders fully reopen.
a few months ago at capital markets day, we outlined three commercial strategy pillars, and we've made strong progress across each of these at the start of this year. first, our premium products continue to lead the recovery and the introduction of delta premium select to the transatlantic marketplace has been a success, with early returns far exceeding our expectations. by this summer, we will have expanded delta -- eps to 80% of our transatlantic flights. over the next few years, we expect premium seat growth to continue to outpace main cabin, and we're confident in the consumer shift toward higher-quality products is here to stay.
to date, premium recovery has been led by consumer, and we see further upside as more and more business travelers return to the skies. next, growing loyalty is evident across several key metrics. our net promoter score remains above 2019 even as volumes increase. and during the quarter, we acquired a record number of new skymiles members and our co-brand spend continues to far outpace 2019, up 39% in the month of march.
loyalty is an important driver of our third pillar, increasing our revenue diversification. other revenue was fully recovered to 2019 levels during the march quarter, led by loyalty and cargo. remuneration from american express during the quarter of $1.2 billion was 25% higher than 2019, a new quarterly record that keeps us on track for our full-year goal of more than $5 billion in remuneration. cargo had an exceptional quarter, up 51% compared to 2019, with the month of march marking our best ever cargo month in the company's history.
mro revenues were 22% below 2019 as supply chain issues slowed our engine throughput. mro margins remain healthy, and we are excited to scale this business over the next few years as the installed base of next-generation engines continues to grow. by leveraging the delta platform, we are further diversifying our revenue mix. in the march quarter, premium products and non-ticket revenue sources generated 58% of total revenue, up three points from the same period in 2019.
this improvement gives us a high level of confidence in achieving our goal of more than 60% by 2024 as we laid out in capital markets day. in closing, delta has emerged in a stronger relative position by staying true to our core competitive strengths and our commitment to our customers and employees. and as the final phase of demand recovery takes hold and preference for our brand continues to grow, i am more confident than ever in delta's path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. and with that, i'd like to turn it over to dan to talk more about the financials.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good morning to everyone. starting with the highlights of the march quarter. our operating loss was $793 million, was better than our expectation. as anticipated, we saw losses in january and february due to omicron and seasonal weakness.
and we inflected to a solid profit in march, with a 9.4% adjusted operating margin. fuel expense was $2.1 billion. it increased 32% sequentially from the december quarter. fuel price per gallon averaged $2.79 for the quarter.
this included a $0.07 per gallon benefit from the refinery. non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially, with non-fuel casm up 15% compared to 2019 on 17% less capacity. we generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. we reinvested $1.6 billion into the business, resulting in free cash flow of $200 million.
delivering a profit in the month of march and positive cash flow for the quarter were important achievements, especially considering the impact of omicron and higher fuel prices. we ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $20.9 billion. this was more than $1 billion better than our initial expectations due to strength in cash receipts that ed and glen spoke to. we repaid $1.4 billion of gross debt, ending march with nearly $13 billion of liquidity.
now turning to the outlook. we expect the june quarter non-fuel casm to be up 17% compared to 2019. the two-point increase from the march quarter is driven by higher selling-related costs, an expected 45% sequential increase in revenue and our anticipated step-up in maintenance costs on a similar level of capacity restoration. with the first half non-fuel casm in the mid-teens, which is two points higher than planned on lower capacity, we expect to be closer to the high end of the full range of up 7% to 10%, implying the second half will improve up to the mid-single digits.
this improvement is driven by continued capacity restoration from the low to mid-80s in the first half to the mid-90s by the end of the year. the resulting scale and efficiency will drive the step function change in our non-fuel casm. now let me give you a little context on how we get this improvement. the recovery in international travel enables us to shift our wide-bodies from our domestic to our international, where we get better efficiency from gauge and stage and improved staffing.
narrow-body utilization will improve, with a 10-point increase expected by the end of the year, giving us a combined benefit of higher capacity and more efficient allocation of our fleet. further, as we fill out our schedules and we create greater stability in our operations with more consistency and depth in both the domestic and the international network, this is enabling efficiency gains in our facilities and productivity of our workforce. we remain confident in our multiyear cost framework laid out at capital markets day. regaining a competitive cost structure is critical to our success.
at the same time, we will continue to remain nimble on capacity as we manage for profitability in this higher fuel price environment. on fuel for the june quarter, we expect an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.20 to $3.35. this includes a $0.20 benefit from the refinery, and these are based on the forward curves as of last friday. our monroe refinery provides a unique benefit, acting as a partial hedge to elevated cracks.
this is especially true with new york harbor jet cracks, where our production at monroe provides 100% offset. based on our june quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect operating margins to be between 12% and 14%. with the expectations for solid profitability and further build in our air traffic liability, we expect to generate another quarter of positive free cash flow after investing $1.2 billion in the business and expect to end the june quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. as we achieve sustained cash generation, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment-grade metrics and making progress toward our $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024.
for the year, our capex outlook of $6 billion is unchanged, with our reinvestment primarily driven by the continued renewal of our fleet. we expect to take delivery of approximately 70 new and gently used aircraft this year, including 26 a321neos. this large grade gauge aircraft fits well with our upgauging strategy and will be our most fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet with the lowest seat cost. we also continue to accept delivery of new 220s, three, 3900s and three, 5900s.
these aircraft are expected to contribute to the full restoration of our capacity and to our goal of using a 7% less fuel per asm in 2022 when compared to 2019. in addition to the financial benefits, improved efficiency is an important step in our journey to a more sustainable future. during the quarter, we announced actions to scale and advance sustainable fuels. we signed an offtake agreement with gevo for approximately 75 million gallons of saf annually over seven years.
we anticipate to start in mid-2026 progressing us toward our 2030 10% saf commitment. we also announced a collaboration with airbus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft and the infrastructure it requires. so in closing, we are executing against our priorities laid out at capital markets day, and i'm encouraged by the momentum in our financial recovery. i would sincerely like to thank the delta people for everything they do every day.
our people will always be our most important competitive advantage. so with that, i'll turn it back to julie for q&a.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, dan. april, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and then go to our first question.
",2022-Q1,DAL
0.009999999999999953,,,,":
operator
absolutely. thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
please go ahead.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody. so dan, building on the prepared remarks, what needs to happen in order to achieve the 2023 capacity plan? being flat with 2019, you're running well below right now, which you could see training bottlenecks presumably ease at some point, but the pilot shortage seems more acute than at capital markets day. regional is cutting back.
you mentioned delivery delays. maybe there's a utilization issue that i'm not modeling for. i'm just trying to assess the feasibility of getting back to 2019 capacity next year and given the implication that, that would have on ex-fuel casm.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. certainly, and we can talk about the feasibility of getting back in and really the progression of nonfuel casm. maybe i'd start with the framework when you think about the total year with the eight points. we had originally guided 7 to 10, pick nine points as the starting point, you add the eight, that's 17.
and when you think about that, we did that on capacity that was 85% restored. you assume you step up to that 100%, that's 15 points of capacity restoration. that drives 12-point improvement in that as you get that utilization of your resources and your capability. now as i talked about in the prepared remarks, not about the hiring, as ed talked about, it's really, we have 95% of the people will be substantially complete with that hiring and training as we move through the second half by year-end, so we'll be well-positioned for that 100%.
additionally, there's two points in there of rebuild that we're incurring to do that, to bring those employees on, to hire them, to train them. and as i talked about, we're running overtime and premium 50% higher than 2019, and that was a level that was already elevated. so you take that out, that's another two points. so that's a 14-point improvement by just better leveraging your infrastructure utilization and the sunsetting of that rebuild off that 17.
and that, along with -- we're certainly going to continue to invest back in the airline. we laid out at capital markets day around the airports and that capability, continue to have that marker in there as it relates to escalation around our workforce and the components around that and managing our supplier inflation, that really puts you in that single-digit level for 2023 on a run rate basis. so it really comes back to we're building it to be fully restored. we'll have those assets on.
it's really then dependent on bringing that capacity online.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and that's fully restored on a full-year basis or fully restored by the fourth quarter of 2023?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hey. thanks, jamie. this is ed. let me jump in for a moment.
good questions. i thought dan did a good job laying out the this is entirely within our control, if there's an underlying sentiment that we've kind of lost something in the operating prowess, i don't see that at all. it's not a full year number of '23 in terms of capacity. we're going to pace it to demand.
i think, in my opinion, by summer of '23 would be our target to get back to 100%. i think we could do it maybe a little earlier or a little later, depending on what we see in the economy. what happens is that the last phases of the restoration of the industry comes together. but i think we have all the piece parts together.
we just are very careful that we not incur any of the disruptive influences and elements that we saw during that six-week period from mid-may to june. and we're going to stay within our capabilities. so i don't think there's anything that's outside of our control here.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. and just a real quick follow-up for glen. the strength in premium, any changes in how consumers are purchasing premium products? is the percent sold at initial ticketing and the subsequent percent sold pre-departure, is that staying the same? i'm just wondering if the inflationary backdrop is causing any changes in the buying patterns of premium.
i realize the aggregate outcome remains very encouraging.
glen hauenstein -- president
no. we had record load -- paid load factors in every one of our premium cabins during the quarter. we had record yields. the travel patterns are pretty sustainable in terms of most of it still being purchased at time of purchase.
actually, the encouraging factor is the continued momentum in corporates authorizing premium travel for their employees who are traveling frequently. so as we move into september, we expect that to continue as we get back into a more seasonal business travel market.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's great. thank you to all three of you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from andrew didora with bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. first question for glen. so it seems like the june trend is continuing into 3q here.
but can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing into your september bookings and kind of how you view the pace of unit revenues throughout the quarter? i would think you're baking in a september that is probably lower than july, august. am i right on that? and then any thoughts that you could provide around how you're thinking about the corporate and leisure recovery come the fall would be helpful as well. thanks.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, our thesis is really what i outlined in my comments that as we get toward the end of summer into the more traditional business travel season, that we're going to see an uptick in corporate travel. and that's been reinforced by a couple of surveys. the delta survey, which really just closed last week, had some very encouraging statistics in that our customers are expecting that travel will pick up meaningfully as we get to the fall. i think the other piece is the international and the rebound of international.
that was delayed and came later than the rebound at domestic. and as we look out to september, we have some really very, very strong data points in terms of travel for international for september. as a matter of fact, september, what we have on the books today, which is about 60% of the total bookings for international, is at record levels much higher than what we experienced in june. so that piece, which we already have in our books is very, very strong, and then we're just anticipating that there's a shift from high, high demand leisure to a little bit better mix of corporate versus leisure demand in the fall.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. makes sense. and then look, obviously, everyone is trying to find the cracks out there the in-services spend. obviously, you have a big partner in amex that has kind of a lot of data around this.
how are you working with amex to maybe identify potential areas of weakness in the consumer? what are they telling you about how consumers could behave in the back half of this year?
glen hauenstein -- president
amex is our closest and best partner and we talk to them constantly and they're not seeing any indications yet. and i think we're all looking for it. but as of now, i think we're enjoying the very, very robust demand that's not only in our spend, airline spend but in our whole portfolio, amex portfolio spend as well.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
andrew, this is ed. let me add to glen's comments. i spoke to some of the media last night, this morning about this as well. there is such pent-up demand for our product.
you've got to remember, people have not had access to our product for the better part of two years. many -- particularly business and some higher-end consumers. and we're not going to satisfy that quench, that thirst in a space of a busy summer period. so there's a lot in there that is yet to come.
but that is our thesis, as glen mentioned. and yes, the data supports what we're seeing today, but we also acknowledge that our crystal ball is only about three to four months right now and it doesn't go all the way as far as people would like us to think. but everything we see tells us that we've got to run -- the only fly in the ointment, in my opinion, is that we don't run a quality operation. i mean, that will keep people from the product.
and that's why we are so focused on delivering a high-quality operation, which is exactly what our team is delivering and that will continue to deliver. and the second thing, and it's been talked about in the industry and we talked about it last investor day is not just the move from goods to service spend because our economy is a lot larger today than it was in 2019, regardless of whatever you think that gdp is, whether we're already into the technically mild recession or not at the present time. i think by most estimates, our economy is about 15% higher than what it was in 2019. and our industry is only about 90% to 95% restored.
that's a pretty big cushion or delta or hedge, depending on your point of view in terms of where the demand strength will be supported. and for delta, it's even lower because we're only about 85% restored. so when you put all those factors together, it gives us confidence that we're going to see continuing strength. we will see some seasonal shift, as glen mentioned.
but i don't think the season will be as pronounced as it's been in the past. and we expect, as long as we run a high-quality operation, which we are doing and we'll continue to do, we should be well-positioned.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you, everyone.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, guys. dan, can you help us on the 22% casm in third quarter going to around 10% in q4? can you help us sort of bridge to that? and then as i look out to the 2023 casm guide you gave at capital markets day, i understand the impact of we'll see how much capacity we can add back.
but if i look this year, casm is eight points worse on five points less capacity, so there's, call it, three points of sort of underlying cost. should we just take that three points and add that to 2023 or can some of that go away as well?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah, two pieces. let me bridge it first to fourth quarter and the step-down, going to come out, i talked about and run capacity at our june levels as we go -- progress through the back half of the year. as you do that and you run that consistently, you get relative restoration in the fourth quarter. so capacity was to be stepped up to be 94% restored, a 10-point step up from the midpoint of our range.
so when you do that, that's where you get that relative improvement as it relates to capacity and efficiency and utilization relative to 2019. that, along with a step-down in some of the rebuild expenses in the quarter, that gives you your over your 10-point improvement really gets you to that 10% level as we go into -- as we go and execute through fourth quarter. that was the first one. the second one, when you think about that, yes, there are -- we're building ahead.
so some of that cost that you're seeing on those three points are costs that were occurring ahead related to it. some of it is the additional point that i talked about in rebuild. we're incurring more overtime and more premium to run the airline this year. so you'd expect that one -- those costs to come out.
so it's both making the investments in and those rebuild costs that will diminish that you'll see improvement in. one of those costs is we put cost in, in regards to our reporting practices and the changes associated with that. yes, that's an increase, but that's going to be efficiencies for us throughout our network in regards to how we run and operate that throughout the system. and we did a lot of work -- the operating teams did a lot of work to test that.
validate that, and we know we'll get those efficiencies as we go forward.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then just second question, just more about the third quarter guide. so it sounds like june had revenue up 4% and margins of 16%, and i'm sure there was some impact from operational issues.
it sounds like that's getting better and fuel is coming down. just i'm trying to understand the 11% to 13% margin guidance for q3 relative to that 16% in june. so any thoughts there would be great. thanks.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
the -- you have the --
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
talk about the month of june.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
for the month of june. as you think about -- let me -- july will be a lot like june and then you step down as you progress through. so the june, july, you get that momentum, but then you get the seasonality and the step-down that glen talked about regarding top line as you progress through the rest of august and september. and then the other element in there as you think about guide, we also -- so that -- and underneath that, remember, we're coming off at june capacity rate.
so we have underlying volume growth associated in that, about 7% to 8% associated with that. so you're getting bridge on that.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i think the other thing, scott, this is ed in there, that we have a pretty significant profit sharing accrual also in the september quarter. in june, most of the results were offset by the loss in the first quarter of the year. so we have profit sharing accrual but it's modest. i think we're looking at close to another $200 million, plus or minus, at these guidance levels of additional expense for profit sharing, which also affects a little bit of the trend there.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
very helpful. thank you, guys. appreciate the time.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey. dan, just to kind of stick on the cost outlook here. so we're looking for up low to mid-singles, we're ending '22 up 18, i guess, sort of 15, 18, whatever the number is, a little bit worse than were before. just can you help us kind of understand like are we still looking up to low to mid-single digits off of the costs that have been pulled forward? or should we be expecting that to moderate a little bit? and then as you think about those -- the overtime and the costs that have been put in ahead of the demand recovering, is there going to be some sort of deceleration in some of that cost even kind of independent of the volume as we kind of think about the back half of this year? or is that going to also be pushed into 2023?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah. you see that step-down slightly in fourth quarter on that. and then it really, really starts to sunset as you flip the calendar and move into 2023 related to that. so you certainly do.
the first part of the question, i missed the very beginning of it.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
so as you look at -- we were -- i think the guidance from the capital markets day was up low to mid-singles on unit cost. should we be kind of moderating that because of the 2022 sort of outperformance on cost? or is it still sort of in that same kind of range from a directional standpoint?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think it's -- again, as we talked about, the destination '24 hasn't changed in regards to it. it will be pace-dependent. as ed talked about, it's in our control, putting the cost in ahead.
it will be really when that capacity comes in and the pace of that capacity that comes in that will dictate that as we progress through 2023. so we'll have to -- as we get to the end of this year, we're going to look at that capacity and how we bring it on, and that will pace how the calendar falls out associated with it. but we expect that the leverage that we're going to get in the incremental casm to be right in line with where we're expecting it. so yes, no change in leverage.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
and glen, maybe just to kind of shift gears for a second and talk about corporate. as you think about the way corporates are buying, are you seeing a return to sort of close-in travel? or is that -- has that changed a little bit, the booking windows being a little bit more elevated? and how does that think of -- and how does that change the load factor you ought to be running the operation at? or does it have any impact on that?
glen hauenstein -- president
what we've seen is a little bit of an elongation of the booking cycle. i think that is also dependent on the relaxation of the cancellation fees. i think one of the things that we didn't talk about is when you look at our quarterly results here, remember, we have no change fees, and that was $1 billion that we had to overcome in the bottom line. so i think we're all learning what the new world is without change fees, and we're seeing some change in travel patterns in terms of aps and in terms of stays.
but i think we've got that well managed. and we are going to run load factors that i think are very similar to 2019 levels throughout the rest of the third quarter and likely into fourth here.
operator
thank you. and we'll take our next question from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys, and thank you. if we think about the overtime pay in the $700 million range for the full year, how much of that was incurred in the first half? and how do we think about it for the remainder of the year, just given the operational adjustments you've made?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. it's pretty balanced. i would say second and third quarter were the highest with it stepping down slightly that we anticipated in fourth quarter as we stabilize and run the operation.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and then as a follow-up to that, i appreciate you guys have the hardest job on the planet here. but how do we think about flex options as we think about labor and salaries, just the number of employees you guys have in 2023, just given the potential different economic scenarios we might have next year? how are you guys planning for that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sheila, this is ed. let me take a stab at that. obviously, we haven't given '23-specific guidance. we've given you ranges and direction but we haven't given you guidance.
i'm going to defer on getting into any detail as to labor in '23, what the cost implications are. we mentioned at the capital markets day that we do have long-term cost growth built into our model, and that is true for all of our work groups. we'll see how the year progresses. obviously, we're in the midst of a pilot contract negotiation, which i'm not going to speak to publicly.
so we'll learn more as we go, but i don't see anything to lead me to believe that the core elements of what we described back in december are going to be that much different when you get to '24, what the trajectory is. and one other thing, i know a lot of it -- dan has been getting a lot of the questions on cost, which i fully understand. but thinking about it from our seat, the last two years, we've been all about trying to drive down cost. and i think our team has done a really good job.
in fact, for the better part of the pandemic, we had over 50% of our cost out, which was unheard of, showing the unforeseen flexibility which we're going to avail ourselves to once we get the operations stabilized. and my direction has been to stabilize and drive reliability. and now that we have demand like we haven't seen ever before as well, all hands are on deck to support and serve that demand. we're going to get to equilibrium over the course of the next 12 months, where cost and revenue and everything's going to be in balance.
i'm confident we're going to end up in a better net spot on at all. but when you have revenues already surpassing 2019 levels, it's hard for the operations to make sure we have enough staff on hand and the focus there. so there's also a lot of costs that are embedded within the system that are hard to tease out but are a function of a very, very intense period of time that we're under.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey. ed, maybe expanding on that answer. obviously, it was a challenging operational period in 2q. but you mentioned it yourself, your employment levels are close to 95% recovered.
i think your own disclosure of pilot headcount is actually kind of flat with where you were in 2019. so can you speak more to maybe what unfolded? what's changed in july? and thinking about it from a brand perspective and a premium revenue perspective, obviously, if you incur a lot more cancellations and queuing at sky clubs and things like that, doesn't that erode that ability in the future? so how are you, i guess, protecting that moving forward?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
it absolutely does erode that into the future. that's the risk, brandon. i agree with that. what we've seen in july as compared to that last six weeks at the end of the second quarter is some different scheduling practices that we've taken within all of the work categories, including our pilots, our flight attendants, and others.
we've made schedule adjustments as well. we've taken any growth out. we're positioned not just for the next month or so. we're positioned for the balance of this year to kind of stay where we're at, and that level of stability gives the operations the capability to focus on the task at hand rather than continuing to invest and build on growth at the same time.
we'll build -- we're going to have the capacity to grow when we're ready, but we want to make sure we're focused on serving what we have. and it's really remarkable being in this business for 25 years now. you run a better airline, everything runs better and the efficiencies start to materialize, that over time goes away on its own. the lines start to move quicker.
and we can also accelerate the training and the experience of our team. when you think about the fact that we've got 18,000 new people that have joined us, many of them over the last 12 months, there's a lot of experience that they're gaining, and that experience and scale is going to pay off. but you don't step into these jobs and you learn it overnight. there's a significant learning factor that we're also going through.
and that's -- whether it's in the airports with what you guys see or what's going on behind the scenes in tech ops or in reservations or in all categories of employment, even technology. so you see all behind the scenes, all the moving parts of how much new folks, new leadership we have in place, it's breathtaking. and i'm optimistic they're doing a really good job, but there's a pretty big learning curve. it's hard to put a dollar amount against, but i know it's going to really pay off as we move forward.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
i appreciate that. i'll just keep it to one.
operator
thank you. we'll go ahead and take our next question from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hey, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. so my one question is related to when you add time, which is what i assume you're doing in changing the boarding process, you're adding time between flights. does that exacerbate pilots and flight attendants running out of time? does it help baggage handling? like how should we think about that? i think dan, you already talked to the cost side.
but how should we think about that from the actually day of operations side?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i'll take that. it doesn't, helane. obviously, it's a fact -- you got to look at the full impact on overall utilization. obviously, utilization comes down a touch.
so it's embedded into the aircraft utilization. dan talked about our aircraft utilizations already having been down versus '19, and we're capitalizing a little bit on that to take advantage of some boarding time. but the fact of the matter is that the -- we were running, with the large narrow-bodies in the domestic system, too hot in the airport environment. we didn't have enough time for our customers.
and this is just recognizing the reality of the operation, which we're already running, which enables everybody to get in position ahead of time. and yes, we're tweaking show in times, reporting times and when the actual assets are being operated. but it doesn't really change a lot in the dynamics. it's going to give our people a little more time to board promptly.
it's also giving us the opportunity, which we haven't been able to fully take advantage in the past actually to depart early when ready. and we're seeing that in meaningful ways. it's improving bags performance. i think the only pinch point we're seeing is making that we analyze make certain we had enough time to get the cleaners off the planes because we're not going to compromise on cleaning either.
and so this has been worked on for the better part of the last year. it wasn't something we thought of overnight. and i think we're fully plugged in across all of the operating groups, that it's going to be a better customer experience, can be a better employee experience. and behind that, it's going to be a better brand experience as well.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then just for my follow-up question is on what kind of technology can you use to speed the boarding process? i know you were working with biometrics and doing some of that leading-edge stuff pre-pandemic and then even during the pandemic. but can you accelerate your it spend to speed the process up and help day of operations, i wonder?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes. we're doing that. we're certain a lot of that's on the front end coming through security. and you may have seen that we've added additional biometric processes and face id and helping working with clear and tsa to get customers through the security queues faster.
at boarding at the moment, i don't see any magic bullets to get physically the number of people that we have on the plane and seated with their bags stowed that much sooner. but we're trying to make it more comfortable process. i don't think it's going to be faster, but hopefully, it'll be more comfortable.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from mike linenberg with deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning. glen, i want to go back to the point that you made where you talked about some of the revenue segments that you were -- that you focused on, to some extent, a hedge against inflation. you talked about basic economy being under 10%.
how has that progressed over, say, the last few quarters as inflation has picked up and presumably some of the more price-sensitive passengers are just getting crowded out by your premium customers. can you give us sort of a sense of how that's trended?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i think you just described what's happened is as spares came up and as inventory controls went into place, while the fares per basic economy were filed, they were not readily available as they were squeezed off by our higher-yielding customers. so our target has been, and really, these are soft targets, but to have less than 20% of our capacity available on basic economy. that's our very soft kind of macro target that we have. and that's come down to below 10% or right around 10% as the high demand through the summer has really displaced those customers.
that's a result, not an intent.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great. and then can you give us a sense, if we go back to 2019 and we looked at sort of how many points of load factor on domestic flights connected to international, and sort of where we are today because i would think that there's probably some decent upside there as you start to turn on more of asia, for example. you are a fairly big connecting airline.
where were we then and maybe where are we now?
glen hauenstein -- president
so the domestic portion of international journey is generally about 10% of our total capacity or less. and that's about -- it's right now in the high single digits so that's a couple of points of load in the domestic system.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. all very high margin, i presume, as it comes on?
glen hauenstein -- president
absolutely. and the recovery has really been led by domestic premium. and now what we're really seeing is the acceleration of international premium as we move into the late summer and the fall. so very exciting for us.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very good. thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from savi syth with raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning. i noticed the kind of used aircraft -- used aircraft purchases this quarter, and i was wondering if you could kind of take a step back and as we look to like 2023, '24 kind of plan and maybe even a little bit beyond, guessing that the small rj reduction in your fleet is probably faster than you had expected back at investor day. i'm just kind of curious what holes you have in the order book? essentially, what do you need in terms of growth or replacement compared to what you have in the order book today? like what could we expect in terms of additional either used or new aircraft that needs to be added to your outlook?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
savi, this is ed. we're reasonably good placed with the order book. obviously, we have opportunity in the next three to five years of delivery for some additional narrow-body, large narrow-body acquisitions, and that's something that we're always talking to airbus and boeing about and whether that's used or whether that's new, there's opportunity there. on the widebodies, we have focused a lot of our energy in the last few years on the wide-body and specifically the 350 and the 330, and we're pleased with the used 350s that we've acquired.
and we've got a pretty healthy stream of wide-bodies coming. so i'd say the focus in the back end of the five-year period is on the large narrow bodies.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. i'll leave it at that. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from stephen trent with citi.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. just one quick one here. when we look back earlier this year, there was this ongoing noise about these 5g towers getting installed in our airports. that all seemed to quiet down.
and in that sort of general theme, are you seeing anything from other industries or maybe government proposals that are causing some concern at the moment? or have these conversations, whether they're industries, with secretary buttigieg and not giving you any sort of concern like that?
peter carter -- executive vice president, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary
steve, hi. it's peter carter. thanks for the question. we have a very, i would say, direct and open dialogue with the administration, with the secretary, and the faa.
and we don't see any, i'll say, storm clouds with respect to any of the initiatives that the government has been talking about. you may have seen that the secretary proposed a bill of rights for passengers traveling with disabilities last friday. that was just a restatement of existing regulations that delta has been following. and obviously, we do everything we can to make sure that our disabled passengers are taken care of every step of the journey.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
ok. really appreciate the color and i will leave it at that. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks. almost fell asleep. nice to speak with you both.
ed, with a longer-term view that operations will kind of normalize and clearly, there's a lot of nonrecurring in the baseline this year that your unit costs will normalize into 2023, what sounds like a constructive view on demand, meaningful free cash flow generation this quarter. how do you and the board think about your stock here in the $20s? i think the plan was to stick to your knitting on deleveraging. but are you shocked with where your equity is trading? and is there any increased emphasis or increased thought on buyback with your stock down here when the restrictions come off?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thanks, duane. yeah. i think we're all surprised with where the stock is, for the industry, by the way, it's not delta-specific, is trading at. and i think it's a function of all the distractions or noise, whatever you want to call it.
we've got a lot of moving parts in the industry as we get through the last phases of this pandemic. and we see the whipsaw effect, whether it's extraordinarily high revenue or high cost to serve that revenue and fuel prices. so there's a lot of moving parts there. we can't do anything at the moment with respect to cares act limitation, so i can't provide you any specifics on that.
but we talk over the long term that we've got a responsibility to all constituencies, to our customers, to our employees, and importantly to our owners as well as our communities. and our owners shouldn't be forgotten about and we didn't forget about them during the pandemic. we did not dilute. our owner's one of the only airlines that didn't do that.
so it's an important point to us, but at this point in time, i really can't speak much about that.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just one last one on transatlantic. some constructive comments from glen, but can you talk about recovery sort of u.s. point of sale versus europe point of sale and how you see that sort of changing over the balance of the year? thanks for taking the questions.
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, i'm glad i got this question because i actually [inaudible] so thank you for the question.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
you're welcome.
glen hauenstein -- president
i think one of the issues is with the euro portion parity is what are we seeing in terms of eu point of sale and eu demand set. and what i'd say is that -- right now, the difference between eu point of sale and u.s. point of sale in terms of referencing back to '19, they are almost identical in terms of the fare increases that we've realized. now one of the things i historically never understood is most things in europe are more expensive than they are in the u.s.
on a dollar-adjusted basis. airfares in europe to the united states were never one of those. so we've gotten some leverage here where we've gotten some nice fare initiatives and structures in place that are taking some of that disparity out of the u.s. point of origin versus the european point of origin.
so i think we like where we sit. i think the one concern is right now, we are in a high u.s. point of sale. everybody likes to go to europe in the summer.
and as we shift to the fall, late fall, certainly that extends throughout the october season. but as we get into the november through february, i'd just like to point out, it would be a great time for you to go to europe. and the after-christmas sales would be very good and you'd be -- your dollar would go further than ever. so we will keep a close eye on that balance as we move in, given the fact that the euro has weakened substantially.
but that's something i think we can accommodate through capacity offering.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from ravi shanker with morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. morning, everyone. question for glen or dan. what percentage of your corporate contracts right now are still grandfather contracts, i.e., pricing from pre-pandemic levels where there could potentially be an opportunity to renew at much higher yields?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, most of our contracts are based on published fares and inventory that's available in those published fares. so it floats. and so i think what we're seeing and when you look at 65% recovered in terms of volume and 80% in terms of sales, you see that we're getting a lot of yield momentum on the corporate side as well. so hopefully, as we get into the fall and corporate continues to return, we can realize those increased fares that are in the market today.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks for the clarity. and maybe just one follow-up. obviously, thank you for all the commentary on how you expect 3q to pan out.
but just wanted to confirm that based on the visibility you have in the booking curve right now, which i think should give you at least three months of visibility, you are not seeing any drop-off in domestic leisure demand post-labor day beyond normal seasonality. is that a fair comment?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
that's fair.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
we'll now go to our last analyst question.
operator
thank you. we'll take our final analyst question from chris stathoulopoulos from susquehanna financial group. please go ahead.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for getting me in here. so ed or dan, there was some news out recently about boeing perhaps getting close to doing a sizable [inaudible] order. and i understand if you don't want to comment on it.
we might hear more on farnborough over two weeks. but that would -- i think if i understand, that would put that first delivery in 2025. and i'm just trying to understand, if there's a pilot shortage out there, the consensus view out through mid-decade, which is a gating factor for domestic asms, could you just sort of frame, what is the peak year, if you will, for retirements for your current pilot workforce?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
so you raised a lot of speculation in your questions so i'll be careful to just speak to what i can. we don't have a massive reduction or retirement bubble in the delta pilot or we have pilots retiring each year over the next handful of years. we were the only airline that offered a significant retirement inducement for our pilots. and close to 2,000 of our pilots took them back in the summer of 2020.
and it's easy to have a revisionist history and wonder whether we should have done that or not should have done that. but you put yourselves back in summer of 2020 when the total revenues were probably less than 20% of 2019 levels. there was no knowledge of what a vaccine could do when it would be found, the effectiveness, etc., and how the world was going to start to reunite. so i don't look back with any regret at all about those decisions.
that said, when you take out 2,000 pilots, you could imagine most of them are -- were at the senior-most levels of the company, that causes churn at a much higher level of delta than other airlines because you effectively wind up training everybody at some point over the following couple of years because everyone will have an opportunity to move up and move to different categories and the like. so we've done a good job of bringing in the next 2,000. we have many of them hired. we saw -- we had some to go, but we're through much of that.
i don't see any pilot shortage issue for delta at all. it is the place pilots want to come to. and certainly by the period of time that you were speculating on the latter part of '25, '26, '27, i think we'll be in a great spot with respect to our pilot staff.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. just a follow-up. so your survey work, i think you mentioned in your prepared comments, is fairly constructive post-labor day and your answer to robbie's question echoes that.
but in your survey work, i know you do a lot of very detailed survey work. have you looked at travelers that have not yet flown during the pandemic and for those that have, the frequency? just trying to get a sense here for kind of look at this sort of pent-up demand from another angle using some of the survey work from the leisure side that you've done over the last few months. thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes. the survey work glen mentioned was largely around corporate travel that we spend an awful lot of time with. we also survey skymiles customers, and we have an active survey dialogue going on there. and there's still pretty -- some meaningful pent-up demand there.
it's not just people that haven't traveled. it's volumes of trips that we anticipate people will take looking forward as they start to catch up on all the experience and all the opportunities that they lost. when you think about this pent-up demand, it feels -- it sounds very personal. it actually is very personal.
it's people investing in themselves to go see friends and family and have life experience that they haven't had time. i can't put how many weddings are being held now. and all the reasons why people travel have not gone away. they've just been deferred and now they're being accelerated in the next period of time.
so whether it's the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, there's a lot of catch-up to be done. and every data point we look around indicates that. people aren't fearful of traveling. i mean, there's still some but it's a significantly shrinking number.
but there's a lot of people that once they're now out on the road, they want to get back on the road. and the only inhibitor that i see, that i hear about is running a quality operation, and we're taking that off the table as a risk factor for our customers.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
that will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. i'll now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, julie. cody, if we could, as we thank the analysts for their time this morning and transition to questions from the media, just remind the members of the media of what our process is, and we'll try to get four or five questions answered while we have time here.
operator
absolutely. thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from alison sider with the wall street journal. please go ahead.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
hi. thanks so much. was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with fares. the cpi data came out this morning and it seems to show some softening.
does that -- have you seen that? does that reflect any softening demand or more resistance to higher fares? or is it just fuel prices coming down?
glen hauenstein -- president
we don't really generally talk about future fares so i'd like to stay away from that. what we see is a very robust demand set and our ability to harness that through both pricing and inventory in the future. so i think we expect a very strong demand set to last through the remainder of the summer and into the fall. and as ed indicated in his previous comments, we do believe there's a lot of pent-up demand for people who maybe didn't make it in the summer or got priced out of the summer who will be able to travel in the fall in november.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
ok. and then just also curious if you're seeing any issues with replacement parts, including engines? are you seeing any lack of availability of spare parts and is that causing any operational issues?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
certainly. when you think about the supply chain as it relates to aviation, it has been -- it certainly has been challenged. it's been well documented from that perspective. we certainly have seen disruptions.
it's forced us to think about how we -- the inventory levels that we carry. we're fortunate that our team has deep expertise and has been doing this for years, where they're able to navigate that where it hasn't impacted, in any way, entry into service or availability of aircraft in a material way. it's allowed us to fly what we wanted to fly. but it's certainly ongoing.
we certainly see those disruptions. we feel them. we work closely with our oem partners on that and to ensure that we're at the top of the list, but we're working proactively with them to increase the flow. but it's day-to-day.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
and is it especially engines or other products that have been a particular challenge?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
it cuts across both engines and components.
operator
thank you. we then move on to our next question from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg
hi. i want to try to follow up really quickly on ali's question, with the cpi report showing that fares fell in june after three straight months of double-digit increases. so i know you don't want to comment specifically on fares, but could you just comment on, is that a signal now that being able to continue to increase fares across the industry is likely being limited? and a second quick question. i wanted to see if you would comment on the report that you're close to a deal for a dozen or so new a220s with airbus? thank you.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mary, this is ed. i think glen answered it well. i didn't look at the cpi report yet that came out this morning, but i think that measure is kind of going from month to month. and when you think about our selling season, we're selling now into the latter part of the summer, early fall already, which seasonally is a little less amount of demand than what we've seen on the front end of the spring and summer surge.
so i don't -- the fare environment, it continues to be healthy. it's not something that we would talk about, but it is -- you can see in our guidance for q3, the demand is quite strong. on your question relative to future acquisitions, as you know, we don't comment on such matters.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. on the training and experience backlog, can you provide a little more detail on how that affected you financially, operationally? and also where are you in hiring? do you still -- do you have any hiring goals for this year? or do you think that the pace is going to start to slow? anything surrounding your plans would be helpful.
thanks.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yes. on the -- a lot of it's in training and we'll talk about pilots. we have an enormous amount of pilot activity and training going on. i'm not sure the exact number, but at any one point in time, we have 1,500 or more pilots in training, which is much larger than we would normally carry.
and by the way, it's not just the training because you have pilots waiting to be trained, that are sitting on reserves. so there's a backup there as well in the process. so it really impacts your overall productivity and efficiency. that will eventually sort itself out as we move through -- move the snake -- the bubble through the snake here and we get to the other end of that.
it's going on with technicians, with mechanics. it's the experience we see with our vendors, our contractors, their ability to repair parts. they're having some of the issues with experience the same way we have new people learning. so it touches every part of our operation.
and the good news is that we've got all our folks. and so we're at peak with respect to ""training"" and i wouldn't call it inefficiency but the cost of efficiency. and every month that goes by, it's going to get better.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
and in terms of the hiring numbers, do you expect the pace of hiring to slow for the rest of the year, whether being full or --
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're at -- as i mentioned in my remarks, we're at roughly 95% of 2019. there's more hiring to be done in pilots. there's more hiring to be done in flight attendants, in mechanics.
the big areas that we are hiring at much larger numbers previously were in the airports and the reservations. and in those two areas, we are largely where we need to be. so additional staffing, certainly, but that is largely resolved.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from dawn gilbertson with wall street journal.
dawn gilbertson -- air travel reporter
hi. good morning ed, you gave some really good statistics on the nascent turnaround here in july. i wondered if you or glen or somebody could talk about the baggage handling situation. i'm just hearing anecdotal evidence, not just the delta on some baggage handling issues, lost bags.
can you share, i mean, how is delta doing in baggage handling and if there are trouble spots, where they are, and how you're addressing them? thanks very much.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure, dawn. as you can imagine, when you hit a rough patch in your operations, the bags are going to be affected probably even more so than customers. and indeed, that's what we saw happening in may and june. that said, in july, month to date, we're actually ahead of goal that we had set for ourselves in terms of baggage performance.
it's early but it's a good indication. we missed our goal by a relatively modest amount in june, the month of june. but one of the things i was impressed with is the atlanta airport, which is our biggest baggage center and our biggest customer point was actually ahead of goal for june. so the baggage issues for us are not domestic.
domestic, our operations are running in a really great place. it's tended to be more on the european side, where the airports, the european airports have -- don't have the staff, and they haven't had the ability to invest ahead of time the way we've had here in the u.s. we're working with our airports, with our partners, with people on the ground. we've gone as far as recently, we had a separate charter just to repatriate bags back to customers that have been stranded because of some of the operational issues the european airports were having.
and we did that on our own nickel just to reunite or to help the customers sort their bags as quickly as possible.
dawn gilbertson -- air travel reporter
thank you very much.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
thanks, dawn. cody, we have time for 1 final question, and then we'll turn it back over to ed for closing comments. thank you.
operator
absolutely. thank you. we'll take our final question from rajesh singh with reuters.
rajesh singh -- airline reporter
hi. thanks for taking my question. we are told that delta is in talks with airbus to expand the existing order for a220s and a deal could be signed next week. is this accurate and if it is, can you please share the details?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we don't comment on upcoming decisions that have yet to be taken, so i'll leave that at that. well, i want to thank you all for joining us today. it's -- there's been a lot happening in our industry and in our business, and it was a very active second quarter. i'm proud of the work our team did to deliver a great financial result, a real inflection point as we coined it.
and we look forward to a strong third quarter ahead. we'll keep a close eye on the operations and encouraged with what we're seeing. and we expect to report even better results when we get to the q3 report in october. so thank you for joining us, and hope you have a good rest of your summer.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines june quarter 2022 financial results conference call. my name is cody, and i'll be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
julie stewart -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, cody, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us for our june quarter 2022 earnings call. joining us today from atlanta, our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our cfo, dan janki. ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy.
glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. after the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. [operator instructions] today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie, and good morning. we appreciate everyone joining us today. in a challenging operating environment for the entire industry, i want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you've come to expect from delta. i'll speak more to the operation in a moment, but the good news is that we're making great progress to deliver the best-in-class experience that our customers deserve, and i'm pleased with our july performance to date.
this morning, we reported june quarter earnings per share of $1.44 with $1.4 billion of operating income and a 12% margin on revenues that were close to 2019 levels. results improved throughout the quarter with revenue in the month of june 4% ahead of the june 2019 number with a june month operating margin of 16.5%. so it was only three and a half points lower than june of 2019 despite a near doubling in fuel prices and our schedule only 82% restored. we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which brings us close to $2 billion year to date, reflecting the robust demand environment and enabling further delevering as we work to regain an investment-grade balance sheet.
june quarter performance represents an important financial inflection and resulted in a profit-sharing accrual for our employees. these results are a validation of the dedication of our people who have done an amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances imaginable over the past two and a half years. we're happy to have been able to reward eligible employees with a 4% raise on may 1st, and we're looking forward to delta people celebrating well-deserved and meaningful profit-sharing payouts for years to come with our return to profitability. rebuilding delta's operation during an unprecedented surge in customer demand has been a remarkable feat, and i'm grateful to our people for everything they do on a daily basis.
while the demand and revenue landscape is the best we've seen, the operational environment for the entire industry remains uniquely challenged. i'd like to sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted by cancellations, delays, and long wait times over the last two months. this quarter's operational performance has not been up to our industry-leading standards, and restoring operational excellence is our top priority. steps we've taken include the strategic direction to hold capacity at the june month level for the remainder of this year as well as additional investments to restore operational integrity, including earlier boarding procedures and operational buffers.
we are pleased with the progress and july is off to a very good start with a 99.2% completion factor through the first 11 days of the month, which is exactly on par with the same holiday period in 2019. in fact, over the last seven days of this period, we've had only 25 cancellations worldwide on over 30,000 departures. over this period, 84% of our flights have arrived on time, as measured within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival. since the start of 2021, we've hired 18,000 new employees and our active headcount is at 95% of 2019 levels, despite only restoring less than 85% of our capacity.
the chief issue we're working through is not hiring but a training and experience bubble. coupling this with the lingering effects of covid and we've seen a reduction in crew availability and higher overtime. by ensuring capacity does not outstrip our resources and working through our training pipeline, we'll continue to further improve our operational integrity. while our actions delayed the improvement we expect in nonfuel cost, we know the best path to driving a competitive cost structure is running a high-quality operation.
and the most important point i'd leave with you is that the issues we're facing are temporary. we are already seeing significant improvement and operating in line with our record-setting performance levels of july of 2019. turning to the revenue environment. strong demand and pricing trends are continuing into the september quarter.
we expect revenue to be up 1% to 5% versus 2019 with an 11% to 13% operating margin. consumer demand continues to maintain strength as we look to the fall and we're seeing steady progress in the return of business and international travel. like all consumer businesses, we're closely monitoring consumer behavior and have yet to see any meaningful pullback in demand. however, if demand were to weaken, i'm confident we have the tools and resources to remain profitable through the cycle.
the last time an economic recession hit our business was in 2009 and absent fuel hedge losses at that time, which we no longer utilize, delta was profitable that year. comparing then to now, delta's business has structurally evolved in significant ways over the last decade, building a trusted and premium consumer brand with proven competitive advantages within a much-improved industry. our revenues are far more diversified with much larger contributions from our premium product offerings and high-margin loyalty business as well as our growing mro and cargo businesses. and our balance sheet and access to capital are much stronger as proven during the pandemic.
we've recently made major customer enhancements that will strengthen our brand for years to come, including recent openings this quarter of world-class airport facilities at lax and new york's laguardia airport, two largest markets for travel in the country as well as new delta sky clubs in key markets. we spent over a decade building our reputation as the most reliable airline globally, but we're not only determined to deliver that same standard of excellence but are investing to bring it to an even higher level. in the face of the pandemic, financially, we've been profitable over the last 12 months, with margins this summer beginning to approach 2019 levels despite meaningfully lower capacity and a doubling in fuel prices. in my opinion, a pretty remarkable turn in performance.
with our results in the first half of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 targets for earnings per share of over $7, more than $4 billion in free cash flow, and a return to investment-grade metrics. now i'll turn it over to glen to talk about the revenue environment.
glen hauenstein -- president
thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. i want to start by thanking every one of our employees for their professionalism and the care they deliver to our customers every day. we are pleased with the return of demand across all categories and regions. momentum accelerated through the june quarter, enabling the recapture of higher fuel prices.
looking forward, we are seeing demand and pricing strength carry into the late summer and fall as demand remains strong. the success of our customer-focused strategy and strength of the delta brand is evident in strong june quarter results across our diverse revenue streams, including premium product outperformance and a record quarter for both amex remuneration and cargo. we generated $12.3 billion of revenue in the june quarter and achieved a total unit revenue that was 20.5% higher than 2q of 2019. revenue compared to 2019 progressed from down 15% in the month of march to up 4% in the month of june, resulting in quarterly revenues that were 1% below 2019 levels.
we've seen broad-based demand and yield momentum with each region generating positive unit revenue growth. premium product revenue continues to outperform and is at 10 points higher than 2019 domestically outpacing the growth in main cabin. domestic consumer revenue remains healthy and is ahead of 2019 levels. international consumer revenue showed significant improvement during the quarter as travel restrictions eased and many countries removed testing requirements, including the united states.
latin america and transatlantic exceeded 2019 levels in june, and the pacific is accelerating as korea and australia have reopened and restrictions are easing in japan. business travel continues to improve. during the june quarter, domestic corporate sales were 80% of 2019 levels on a 65% recovery in volume. international corporate sales improved 30 points during the quarter to 65% of 2019 levels, led by the transatlantic where the recovery is now on par with domestic.
our recent corporate survey results show positive corporate expectations for business travel in 3q, with several of the least recovered sectors conveying strong optimism for increased travel this fall. as the recovery progresses in these sectors, we expect an outsized impact on our coastal hubs. our corporate customers expressed increased plans to travel internationally in the second half of the year, given the elimination of the pre-departure test requirement for flights returning to the united states. similar optimism was reflected in morgan stanley's recent global corporate travel survey, where respondents indicated travel volumes would reach 84% of 2019 levels in the second half of 2022.
this is 20 points above the june quarter volumes and over 90% by 2023. as the leading carrier for business travel with a best-in-class product in the air and on the ground, we will benefit disproportionately as the business community continues to reconnect in person. for the september quarter, we expect revenue versus 2019 to be up 1% to 5% on capacity that is 15% to 17% lower, with total unit revenues versus 2019 improving sequentially. for the full year, we expect capacity to be 15% lower than 2019.
this is a 5% reduction from our initial guidance. as we move to the back half of the year, we expect stronger corporate and international trends to offset seasonally lower customer demand. with a strong brand and diversified revenue base, delta is positioned to consistently deliver a revenue and profitability premium to the industry. we expect more than 60% of revenue will come from premium products and non-ticket revenue sources by 2024.
premium continues to lead with load factors and yields higher than 2019. and as we increase the mix of premium seats in our fleet, improve the display and sales channels and see progression in the recovery of business, premium will continue to grow. a structural shift to premium is key to managing through inflation and economic cycles. historically, more price-sensitive products like basic economy, which is currently less than 10% of our sold fares, have struggled to keep up with inflation, while high-value premium offerings performed much better and have proven to be much more resilient through the pandemic.
loyalty to the delta brand is growing at record levels. we acquired another record number of new skymiles members in the quarter and achieved record spend and acquisitions on our amex co-brand card. more than one in four new cards acquired were platinum and reserve cards. our premium tier is providing another proof point on the growing demand for premium products and brands.
amex remuneration of $1.4 billion was 35% higher than the june 2019 quarter. and to put this in context, that is more than the remuneration for the full year in 2009. we're on track to receive over $5 billion in remuneration this year from american express, and we remain confident in our 2024 target of $7 billion. the decommoditization of our business, combined with diversifying revenue through the growth of loyalty, mro, and cargo have improved our financial resiliency and cash generation.
we entered the second half of the year ahead of many of our commercial goals set at the capital markets day. and we're excited about the opportunities to elevate our performance by extending our advantages and leveraging the delta platform. delta has been the most disciplined in restoring capacity and will remain nimble depending on the environment while staying true to our core competitive advantages. with that, i'll turn it over to dan to talk about the financials.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good morning to everyone. for the june quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.44, operating income of $1.4 billion, and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. our nonfuel unit cost was 21.8% higher than 2019, largely because our network is 18% smaller. our operating margin was 11.7%.
it came in below our most recent guidance as operational disruptions impacted both revenue and fuel prices moved higher. operating cash flow of $2.5 billion was driven by solid profitability and a sequential build in the advanced ticket sales. quarterly gross capex spend was $864 million. with nearly $2 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, we repaid $2.4 billion of gross debt, ending june with $13.6 billion of liquidity and $19.6 billion in adjusted net debt.
our first half financial performance puts us ahead of our initial expectations at the start of the year, supporting our outlook for meaningful profitability in 2022. the exception to this outperformance is our nonfuel unit cost. at capital markets day in december, we laid out a progression to return our nonfuel unit cost structure to within a few points of 2019 by 2024. the actions that ed spoke about have changed the pace of our unit cost progression but not the destination.
the primary drivers are slower capacity restoration and additional investments that deliver the operational excellence. the biggest impact is in the third quarter, where we expect nonfuel casm to be up approximately 22% versus 2019 on capacity that is 15% to 17% below 2019. for the full year, we now expect nonfuel unit costs to be approximately eight points higher than we initially guided. the level of capacity restoration accounts for the majority of this increase, as we are largely carrying the full cost of the airline with only 85% of our flying restored.
as a result, we are not fully utilizing our assets. for example, third-quarter aircraft utilization is about 10% lower than 2019. and while we have over 95% of the employees needed to fully restore capacity, we have thousands in some phase of hiring and training process. the remainder of the increase is driven by investments to support the operation, along with smaller items like higher maintenance and inflation.
actions related to reliability include added operational buffers and overtime. premium pay and overtime is expected to total over $700 million this year. this is 50% higher than 2019. while we're delaying our unit cost recovery, it is pace-dependent and within our control.
we remain confident in our ability to meaningfully improve our unit cost as we rebuild capacity, improve efficiency, and run our operations in line with the delta high standard. now moving to fuel. second quarter fuel expense increased nearly 60% sequentially on higher prices and volume, with an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.82. the refinery continues to provide a hedge to historically high cracks, accounting -- contributing $269 million of operating income during the quarter.
this resulted in a $0.31 benefit to our adjusted fuel price per gallon. for the september quarter, we expect the adjusted fuel per gallon between $3.45 to $3.60. including a $0.27 per gallon contribution from the refinery based on the forward curves as of last friday, we expect fuel efficiency to be about 5% better than 2019. based on our september quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect operating margins to be between 11% and 13%.
gross capex is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion as we take more aircraft deliveries. we've seen some delays in deliveries and it's possible this trend continues. debt reduction remains a key priority. we expect to end third quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion.
our goal is to reduce net debt by $5 billion through 2024, bringing us back to investment-grade metrics. we remain confident in our ability to make this goal, unlocking significant equity value for our shareholders. in closing, we have made meaningful progress in restoring our financial foundations. with this progress, our opportunities ahead, and the resilient demand for air travel, we remain confident in our 2024 financial targets.
in closing, i'd like to thank the delta people for their hard work, the service they provide our customers day in and day out. our people will always be the delta difference. with that, i'll turn it back over to julie for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] we'll now take our first question from conor cunningham with melius research. please go ahead.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
hey, everyone. thank you. you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but the opportunity [inaudible].
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
conor, you're cutting out. conor, you're cutting out. can you please repeat your question?
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
is that better?
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
try again.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
is that better?
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
yes.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
ok. cool. you touched about the opportunity in atlanta and the other core markets in 2023, and i think that's a really powerful trend for you guys. and i was just wondering if you could unpack it a little bit more, just -- i think you're really [inaudible] flow traffic.
and you kind of -- your priority [inaudible] market or other markets [inaudible] recovery. so could you just talk about the margin profile of flow traffic in general and just how you expect that to trend into next year? thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, we set really two priorities during the pandemic that we wanted to come through that we thought would be important for the long-term strength of the franchise, and one was to improve our competitive positions in the coastal gateways. and we've certainly completed that as we exited the pandemic and get into a more normalized demand sets. so if you look at places like los angeles where we've now taken the no.
1 position or boston in terms of revenue, same in boston, and we've strengthened our position in key markets like seattle. so that was very important for us. the other thing to do was to not lose share in our core, and that was really the very tricky part. so we went in with a share in our core hubs of about 58% to 59% when you added them all up.
and our goal is to exit at 60% or above, and we did that as well. so if you think about our core being approximately 20 points less restored than the coastal gateways, which are now fully restored or actually growing, maintain your core hub share or actually increase it, there was a lot of focus on that through the revenue management systems. so we choked off what i would say is more of our traditional flow in very key markets where delta has historically been the leading carrier, particularly in the southeast. and so, as we head into -- and these customers or our customers are in our loyalty program.
but in a lot of cases, they couldn't get fares that were competitive on delta because we didn't have the seats to produce those. and really, as we head into 2023, our task that we've assigned our team is to get those historical high-yield flow customers back on delta. and that's really our -- what our rebuild phase for 2023 is all about.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from savi syth with raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i was [inaudible] to achieve those kind of goals that you just talked about on the pilot side, could you detail a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of training bottlenecks and pilot staffing on the mainline side, as well as maybe attrition and staffing levels on the regional side?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i could take it, savi. we continue to make good progress in clearing those bottlenecks and getting our pilots into seats and categories every week. we're producing more and more pilots back to the operation. as we said in our remarks, our goal is to be in a position to have our network fully restored by the summer, and the pilots are obviously a big part of that.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
but can you provide a little bit more color on the regional side given that's a little more unique as to what's happening there and not just about training throughput? is some of the kind of the changes that you're seeing in the industry in terms of pilot rates and things like that, is that having an impact? what's delta doing to make sure you're rebuilding those -- that capacity?
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, clearly, the labor rates at the regional carriers have moved during the pandemic, and they're at significantly higher rates than they were prepandemic. i think long-term conventional wisdom is that will mean that the regional fleet in the long run are smaller. in the short run, we're wanting to get to a stabilization of demand for pilots, and we think that will occur sometime in '23.
these new higher rates should keep more people in place. and so -- but we don't think it will be fully restored until probably '24, '25 at the earliest. and we're uniquely positioned there because we have the, of course, a220s, which we're delivering every month or so. and we've reactivated the 717s, which were actually not in our original plan for reactivation, but we've leaned on them pretty heavily to rebuild more quickly.
and we think it's a better product. and now with the new labor rates, it's at lower unit cost, as well as, yes, much lower unit cost than prepandemic. so i think we're uniquely positioned there with really the only major carrier that has these plethora of 100-seat airplanes. and we'll see what happens with the regionals in '23, but we think we're near the bottom in terms of pilot availability there.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and one other thing i'd add is that we have the lowest regional jet footprint in the industry. we've been on a half, savi, over the last decade to eliminate the 50-seat regional jet, and we're just about there. so we are out of that category. we do have 325 2-class regional jets, which we will continue to maintain going forward, but we are far less exposed than others to the -- some of this regional pilot shortage issue.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now move on to our next question from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. glen, i'm sure you've gotten this from a lot of investors. but obviously, folks are worried about a looming recession in the u.s. just driven by rates and inflation.
and we're reminded of that again today. but obviously, your revenue guidance is pretty positive, but i do think it's a sequential decline in your yields. can you talk to the components there? because i know your long-haul flying is coming up as well. just if you're seeing any weakness or softness across your geographies.
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i think that's a great question, and i'm happy to explain it. really, it's three main factors. one is international restoration continuing in 4q as we -- as pacific continues to open up, and we continue to increase our capacity in the pacific that has downward pressure on rasm.
domestic stage is going up dramatically and at a different rate than some of our competitors and all of our competitors as we head into 4q. that's really being driven by a lot of additional flying into hawaii from the east coast hubs that we didn't have prepandemic. and lastly, it's that period and the shift of the holiday return in december where december will be below trend, and january will be above trend. so those are the three main factors that are driving the sequential decline.
and we're not seeing -- taking those out, we're not really seeing a decline at the market level. it's actually continuing to be quite strong, and we don't just see any impact yet. we're looking, of course, vigilant of looking for it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary if it does. but i think ed was very clear earlier that we think that we have -- as an industry, very off trend in terms of our percent of gdp.
and just getting back to that represents a huge upside to the industry.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
and i guess related to that, can you talk about business travel recovery in the quarter and what you're seeing right now in the fourth quarter?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i think we outlined earlier conferences that we've seen about a 10-point improvement between 3q and 4q, and we see that continuing through 4q. so we're now in the low to mid-80s in terms of revenue, with traffic being about 10 points below that. and that's what we see as we head into the end of the year.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from michael linenberg with deutsche bank.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. ed, i want to go back to the comment that you made in your opening comments. you said something about $20 billion to $30 billion on the table relative to gdp. can you shed some light on that? and are you assuming that we get back to that historical relationship? or are you building in some cushion there? if you could elaborate.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure, mike. that's an industry number, as you can appreciate. and that gets you closer to the historical relationship. we've seen over many, many years, it's a very sticky relationship.
we saw it fall a bit after 9/11, and we saw it bounce back. we saw it fall during the recession. we've seen it bounce back. and we certainly saw it the biggest fall ever coming back from the pandemic.
so one of the things that we're seeing is such outsized demand for our product across the board. and when you couple that as well with the industry constraints that we also talked about, that is also keeping the pricing strong at the same time. so whether we get back to the full $20 billion or $30 billion, i don't know, but i think we're gaining on it as we go.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great. and then, just a quick one, glen, on the percentage of your total revenue that ties to a premium and diverse revenue streams. i think we're at 54% now, but the goal is to get to 60% by 2024.
that seems somewhat conservative, but maybe you're envisioning just a much bigger pie as other segments recover like asia pacific, and that's probably why it's taking that much longer. am i thinking about that correctly? or is there something else going into that?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and, as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at american express [inaudible]. so i think the one that we're not confident with right now is cargo for 2024. we've seen some lowering yields, but that's being more than offset by the international restoration. so i don't see that continuing to grow at double digits as we head into '24.
but i think 60%, as you pointed out, was our aspirational target. as we get closer and closer to it, it looks like it's -- we may need to increase that as we get closer to '24.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very good. thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. we'll now move on to our next question from david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking the question. so dan, you mentioned the cost of adding incremental capacity right now is very low as we get through to '23. '24.
can you talk about how low that is relative to the average? and then, maybe as a follow-on, ed or glen, can you talk to the topic of maintaining capacity discipline, right? obviously, if there's a way to unlock cost, you want to unlock the cost, but you also don't necessarily want to flood the market. how could -- how would you suggest we kind of sue the investor concerns about that tension between adding capacity to lower cost versus potentially adding too much capacity and tipping over the fair cart?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
ok. first, on the cost opportunity and the incremental costs associated with it. when you think about where we are this year in '22, we're 18 points higher on a unit cost basis versus '19. and in there, there's over nine points related to scale and the ability to put scale in going from 85% restored to being fully restored.
that would go in at low incremental casm in the $0.03 to $0.04 range. and then, there's another five points related to -- i talked about over $1 billion related to the rebuilt and inefficiencies. about half -- almost half of that is rebuilt. and when you think about that bucket, half of that is just the hiring and training intensity that we're under.
and that will -- as ed talked about, as we put people back in production, that will sunset. and then, the other piece is split between elevated over time as we've protected the operation and also the reactivation of the fleet from that product that isn't normal run rate maintenance. so that's really where you get the 14 points of opportunity of the 18, but the incremental piece is at nine points, which is very attractive incremental growth at low casm.
glen hauenstein -- president
on capacity, we are just going to continue to monitor it as we move forward. and each one -- each market is different. and when we look at it not at an aggregate level, but at a market level to ensure that our margins stay where we need them to be. and so, i think that's our -- has been our approach historically.
it's worked quite well. and our approach moving forward is that it's -- it's actually a very granular thing. and what we've seen is demand has come back very different in 2022 than it left in 2019. although the aggregates are now above where we were in '19, where people are flying and why they're flying is very different.
and so, that's where we're going to continue to focus on, seeing opportunities and capitalizing them in '23 as we move forward with our rebuilt.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and david, if i could add to glen's comments, as you also appreciate, we've been, by far, the most cautious about building back our network given that we wanted to make certain we're doing it reliably, and we're doing it with our customers and our people in mind, first and foremost. and so, a good chunk of the restoration is solely that, just getting back up to our normalized industry share our full capacity and utilization of the airline. there are a lot more governors in this environment on the capacity than ever before, whether it's high-fuel prices, high-cost capital, difficulty getting pilot staffed, typically oems producing aircraft. so i think with respect to investor questions around overall capacity levels, i feel very comfortable with what we're doing here at delta.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
so is it fair to say that profitability is more important than achieving some unit costs and market share goal?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
of course. it's always about profitability and margins. and that's why i said in my remarks, i think we are uniquely positioned to do both, to grow where we haven't had the opportunity to grow as quickly as others have grown with strong demand supporting that, coupled with a significant unit cost benefit as we move forward because we already own all the assets and we already have the full staffing numbers pretty much on property.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
all right. thanks for the time, guys.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, guys. thank you for the time. maybe i wanted to ask a big picture question, ed. industry unit revenues are up fairly substantially over the long-term trend due to a number of factors you guys have talked about.
i know you don't want to comment on forward pricing trends for you, but broadly about the industry. do you think that through the pandemic -- with the growth of expansion of premium, growth of loyalty products and other shifts, do you think that there's a structural shift in the way airlines think about pricing and the consumer takes that price?
glen hauenstein -- president
yes. i don't -- we don't ever comment on forward pricing. and i think what you've seen is that the industry has done a good job historically now in recovering the higher cost in both fuel and nonfuel. and i don't see anything that would indicate that that's not going to be the case moving forward.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. then maybe just a quick follow-up. can you just talk about the strength of the dollar versus other currencies and then how that's potentially affecting international demand at all?
glen hauenstein -- president
absolutely. great question. as we know, the dollar is at historic highs right now. and normally, we would see that impacting our offshore point of sale in terms of realized fares.
but given the demand and supply balance that's existing right now in all of the international marketplaces that we serve, we see that not materializing. the fare increases have more than offset the lower currency rates. and indeed, the onshore tracking as a percent of 2019 is roughly in sync with offshore revenue. so really good balance.
and what we've also seen is given the strength of the dollar, that outbound travel has more than offset a bit of weakness in terms of the outbound travel from the foreign point of sale. so all in all, that's been a very positive mix for us. at a service level, you might look at it and say that could be trouble. but for us, it's not been trouble as delta.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. morning, guys. so on the amex side, $5.5 billion, you're talking about going to $7.5 billion by $24 million. how do you think about '23? is it linear? how does the downturn in consumer spending impact that trajectory?
glen hauenstein -- president
i'd say given where we sit right now, we are very confident in the $5.5 billion, and we have some rate adjustments that occur in '23 that give you a good way to the $7 billion, and then the continued acquisitions. i think we're -- we have some cushion in there right now. and it's not a stretch objective to get to $7 billion in '24 as we sit today. and so, there's a little cushion in there should we see revenues plateau.
well, having said that, we have not seen card spend plateau. and although we have a record number of accounts in force, we're also seeing record spend on individual cards right up until today. so, i mean, this is really current numbers that we're looking at. and so, while we're mindful that that may trend down a little bit, i think we've got some cushion in there given the strong acquisition and, if any, the brand.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then, with all the talk about the excess cost in the network right now and restoring the network, what's your degree of confidence that casm could be down year over year, '23 versus '22, and you can maintain sort of double-digit margin even if pricing starts to moderate?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. it goes back to a little bit what i talked about earlier. when you think about sequentially year over year, we're up 18 points. so our confidence is as high as it relates to the 14 points that i talked about in an opportunity for clear improvement because of the capacity going in, 15 points alone drives over nine points of that.
the other one i gave you a lot of color on it is regarding the rebuild cost, and those will certainly sunset and dissipate as we complete the rebuild. and then, i think the last one is the efficiency, which is the other half of that five-point, and we'll get that over time. that's about the proficient -- the workforce and our resources getting more effective. it certainly is helped by the operational reliability that is foundational to that as that happens.
and we see that the workforce will get the hours more aligned to the operations. and the underlying processes and efficiencies will come through.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and scott, if i could wrap that, is that when you think about next year, obviously, we're going to be bringing a fair bit of capacity into the domestic system. that's going to help with what glen mentioned earlier, a lot of our customers are priced out of our products. and so, we're going to be bringing more affordability, opening us up to additional buckets of demand. yet at the same time, the incremental marginal cost of delivering that supply is substantially lower than any modest price adjustments we would see.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you, guys.

thank you. we'll now move on to our next question from andrew didora with bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. glen, when i look at kind of your domestic passenger revenues, 3q, they were up two. and 2q, they were up 30.
what do you think it takes to get the domestic network growth accelerating? is it just the capacity adds in your core hubs that you spoke of earlier on? or should we just think about the opening up of international markets being the main driver of the revenue recovery over the next few quarters?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think it's both, right, is that -- and pretty evenly distributed. we have first time [inaudible] we're actually now bigger in the transatlantic in the month of october than we were in october of '19 and with very successful unit revenues and improved profitability there. so i think as we head through the winter, it's international growth. we have latam now really starting to come online in earnest.
and then, the japan opening in -- right now is a very exciting thing for us being a historically very large carrier in japan. so if the international marketplaces are open and open without restrictions, we see robust demand, and we see that continuing to be our backdrop. we see -- we have good visibility now to the winter in europe because the aps are a little bit longer in europe. and so, now we're thinking about the spring.
and i can't imagine that as we get to spring and summer of next year that we don't see another robust demand because we did miss three years of demand for the leisure travel to europe. so people run out of time, myself included. and i think, gosh, how many years do i have left to do that? and so, i think we have a really good backdrop there. and then domestically, these are customers that we know want to fly delta.
these are in our core regional markets that we just weren't able to produce capacity at attractive inventory levels that they would want to purchase on delta. and as we bring those down, as ed mentioned earlier, as we bring those relative fair premiums down, as we open up the hubs, we think that's going to be some relatively easy lifting for us.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and just wanted to follow up from an earlier question as regard to the improved training pipeline that ed mentioned earlier. look, you've been very consistent about carefully building back the network by next summer.
but if you wanted to, would you have enough pilot availability and enough labor to accelerate that network restoration? not saying that you will, but i'm just trying to get a sense of where you stand just in terms of the pipeline -- the training backlog.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
you can expect our network rebuild to be disciplined. it's going to steadily grow. but we're not going to fall in the trap we were last spring where we pushed ourselves too hard. so we learned from that.
we're not going to accelerate it faster, and we're ready to deliver.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. glen, you commented a couple of times on corporate recovering, but looking different. hoping you can expand on that, but also include leisure. and just a couple of examples.
looking at j.p. morgan employee patterns, friday meetings are increasingly difficult to get. so most of our employees are coming back thursday night instead. i'm seeing people leave earlier for thanksgiving since they know they can work on the road.
i'm just looking for more examples of these type of shifts and, more importantly, whether revenue management and scheduling have to evolve to take advantage of it.
glen hauenstein -- president
i think they already have. and i think, as i mentioned earlier, that the demand sets are very different than they were in 2019 in terms of places people are going, in terms of times that they're going. and we're making those adjustments. i think one of the more interesting things, as you mentioned, monday -- sunday night outbound, monday morning outbound used to be the peak.
that's now bleeding into tuesday, out tuesday, back thursday, so some shorter trips midweek. it's bleeding into people, taking -- mixing business and leisure. so i know myself, i went to paris last week for meetings, and i spent the weekend for leisure and before i probably would have just come back. so i think we see that.
we see in the holidays with people not having to necessarily be in the office as regularly as they did before the pandemic, and we see people stretching out the holiday. so sunday night, monday morning -- sunday night returns or the sunday after thanksgiving was historically the highest revenue day we had in our network. that's now a little bit lighter, and we see that travel moving into monday and tuesday returns. so yes -- and we've been making those adjustments along the way, and i think pretty successfully.
and i think it's pretty exciting, right, that it's coming -- in aggregate, it's coming back differently, but it's coming back even stronger.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. and quickly for ed. so mark and i have been doing quite a bit of work on latam. you referenced it before now that the jba is in place.
can you update us on the partnership? i mean, how have your forecast changed because of their restructuring, as well as the industry dynamic in south america? how should we think about the contribution of delta going forward? just an update there would be appreciated.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
sure. a couple of things that have changed. one, as you know, they've also worked through the very difficult restructuring. and they're still not out of the court process, though they expect to be out sometime next month.
so we're anxious to see them out, and that's going to provide them some additional opportunities to start to grow and really take advantage of the powerhouse they've become, as well as the substantial reduction in cost, as well as balance sheet -- reductions on debt that they've been able to achieve through the bankruptcy process. we just got the ati from dot, and we're excited about that. so we haven't really been able to talk in three years to them at a detailed level about the jv itself, though those meetings are beginning literally as we speak. and it's a little bit of a delayed response, but there's nothing in there that we laid out three years ago when we announced the investment in latam that i'm any less excited for.
i think if anything, we're going to have an accelerated impact there. the competitive balance in south america is less intense as a lot of local airlines got hit by the pandemic pretty hard. and you look at them, you look at what we're doing with aeromexico in the same time, we see a lot of growth potential for delta, as well as the jv.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. thanks for the color. i appreciate it. take care, everybody.
operator
thank you. we'll then move on to our next question from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thank you. most of my questions have been asked. but maybe one for glen on seasonality and sort of getting back to normal seasonality, which some other carriers have referred to. can you just talk about which regions, if any, are sort of back to normal and maybe contrast domestic with some of the international regions, which are probably outperforming sequentially?
glen hauenstein -- president
i'd say there's a new normal on all of this. and while we do start to see seasonality patterns reemerging that we're not as present in the early stages of the rebuild, they're not as acute maybe as they were prepandemic. so we had a fantastic september to florida, absent of the hurricane, which you wouldn't have thought. if you look at september, which is historically one of the worst months for florida, you couldn't buy a ticket to disney.
we had some people who were on break here, and they said they wanted to go to disney with their families, and they couldn't buy a ticket. it's closed out. and so, i think we've seen this shift. and as airfares have increased and as hotels have increased and the whole -- people are also moving to the shoulders a little bit more because they can take advantage of the fact that on the margin, it's a little bit less expensive, and they have more flexibility with their work that they don't necessarily need to be in the office on those days.
so i think yes, there are definitely things that are reappearing in terms of more traditional seasonality. but i think also, there are a lot of things that are offsetting that [inaudible] it and making it a little bit less pronounced as it was prepandemic.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, maybe just one for dan. just given the move in rates, any high-level thoughts on pension gains versus interest expense? and any particular pieces of debt that you'll need to roll in 2023 and how we should be thinking about that?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes. certainly. as it relates to the debt stack, 17% of our debt is variable, and the size of that relative to our cash position, our cash position to outsize. so as you have increasing rates, actually, interest income will outpace interest expense meaningful through that period of time.
on the pension, you have both the -- when you think about it, rates reduce your liability, change your interest expense. those are fairly neutral as you're going forward, certainly change in your asset returns versus your expected performance. and given how debt and -- the debt markets and equity markets have moved, we've underperformed the expected target rate. so you smooth those into earnings over a 20-year period, and then you earn off a lower rate.
so that would create a headwind. as you think about going forward, we'll talk more about that in december. we had that stepping down somewhat, but not to the degree that it will. but interest expense is ahead.
as we've been ahead on, on managing down our debt levels and ahead on that, our interest expense is coming in better, and our interest income will be better, which will be a partial offset to that.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts.
operator
thank you. we'll then move on to our next question from ravi shanker with morgan stanley.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great morning, everyone. i just wanted to confirm something that i heard you say about the holiday season being extended and that kind of pushing some demand into january. can you unpack that a little bit and kind of talk about how much that impacted your 4q comps versus 2019? and also, did you see something similar over the summer into the fall where do you think that some people who may have been priced at of traveling over the summer are now traveling in the fall?
glen hauenstein -- president
no. i think it's mostly the fact -- just a calendar shift of where the returns are. and so, i think that's -- and we think it's about two points of sequential decline from -- in our 23.5 to 17, about two points of that is a shift of some of the returns of the holiday into january.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
we'll now go to our final analyst question.
operator
thank you. we'll take our final question from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much for squeezing me in here. i appreciate the time. so team, here's my question. as you think about the shift in mix that you've been talking about, not just this quarter, but most of the year, how should we think about the importance of loyalty? you've talked about the increase in skymile cards and the spend you're seeing.
but i have to think that loyalty is shifting kind of away from that business traveler to the leisure traveler. so how should we think about that going forward?
glen hauenstein -- president
well, helane, i think at a macro level is that whatever your purpose was, the redemptions that [inaudible] at the end was always for the leisure travel. and so, as people continue to see our brand evolving and want to become involved with it, whether or not it's for business or for leisure, we've seen the opportunity to continue to grow the program itself at record pace, which is very exciting and, i think, a real testament to the brand strength and all the hard work that delta people put out every day. and now it's our job to take that brand strength and turn it into profitability. and of course, we do that through using those as prospects for our american express card, but we're also increasingly making our ecosystem broader.
and i think just yesterday, we had a very claiming announcement about partnering with starbucks and linking our programs together. and i think creating an exciting dynamic ecosystem that is the cornerstone of our loyalty program, which is, of course, based on the fantastic airline that delta runs every day, is really the base of it. but we are very excited about where we can take this over the next five years in terms of expanding that loyalty platform to be more than just delta as an airline.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you that's very helpful.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
all right. with that, we'll wrap up the analyst portion of the call. i'll now turn it over to trebor banstetter, our managing director of enterprise and leader communications, to start the media questions.
trebor banstetter -- managing director, enterprise and leader communications
thank you, julie. cody, as we transition to the media q&a, please remind all the reporters on the call the process for joining the queue. we're going to try to get to as many questions as we can in our remaining time.
operator
absolutely. thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news. please go ahead.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
hi. thank you very much. i wanted to first get a quick clarification. when you were talking about the regional capacity being constrained -- continuing to be constrained, and thus, your capacity being constrained by the pilot shortage, i thought i understood you to say you don't expect the full restoration at the regional level until '24, '25 at the earliest.
i wanted to make sure i was hearing that correctly and whether you're talking about just delta or if you're talking about the industry there.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, i can't speak to the industry. i can speak for delta. and yes, you've got it right, '24 to '25 is when we think we'll have the utilization back to historic levels on all the equipment we have contracted.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. and my second question was in terms of -- during the pandemic where you had a lot of leisure travelers who were flying, opting to buy up into premium seats because a lot of them were empty, are you still seeing that same thing? are you seeing a lot of them buying up? or do you -- have you seen that pull back now and not happening quite so much?
glen hauenstein -- president
it's strengthening as we get -- come out of the pandemic. so we're very excited. and i think we highlighted in the call that our recovery is being led by premium products. and premium products are -- restoration is 10 points ahead, main cabin and basic economy.
so very excited about people getting used to this, people enjoying it. and intend to repurchase is over 70%. so you see the customers coming back for more of this as well.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
and have you dropped the number of basic economy fares that you offer per flight or even total?
glen hauenstein -- president
that fluctuates every day based on demand and supply. so in general, it's been trending lower, but that could reverse itself today or tomorrow. so it's not something we actively manage. it's kind of a daily occurrence.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] thank you. we'll take our next question from david slotnick with tpg.
david slotnick -- senior aviation business reporter
hi. good morning. thanks for the question. i'm wondering just with the growth in co-brand spend and card acquisitions and everything, are you seeing more numbers just year over year and year over '19 meeting medallion status or meeting the higher levels of status?
glen hauenstein -- president
absolutely. and we want to continue to evolve our program today. it's premium for our most premium customers. and as you all know, we announced some changes for the '24 program earlier this month, which was really designed to ensure that we had the correct people.
we were the most generous, as you know, also during the pandemic in extending benefit. so we actually have seen an incredible increase in the number of our most premium customers. and -- but our intent is to make sure that everybody who is a premium customer has a really premium experience. so we've got to balance that off.
david slotnick -- senior aviation business reporter
and then, just considering the capacity cuts this summer and then the capacity discipline that we've seen going forward, i'm wondering if you have any thoughts on just outlook for the holiday season, what we're going to see in terms of operational reliability?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we will deliver the type of experience for our customers that they expect, which will be continuing to run just a very, very strong operation. one of the things that glen talked about earlier is the shift of travel within the holiday period itself. and i think you're going to see a more normalized flow than you would typically do. holidays tend to be very peaky on the highest days and lighter on some of the less -- lower travel days.
and with travelers having a lot more flexibility and mobility relative to work, i think you're going to see a busy period for the thanksgiving week throughout the week. and that's going to help us operationally a bit as well, managing flow. and i think you'll also see that over the christmas, new year break as well.
david slotnick -- senior aviation business reporter
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll take your next question from alison sider with the wall street journal.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
hi. thanks so much. i guess just kind of thinking about the economy broadly. just curious, from your vantage point, where do we think the economy is? like are we headed toward recession? but it -- maybe you want where travel is more resilient than it's been in the past? are we not? i guess just -- you guys have a pretty -- big picture view from where you sit, so [inaudible] your thoughts.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we mentioned in our remarks that -- and i really do believe it. so the airline industry, not just delta, is in a countercyclical recovery because we're still building back from where we were. and so, the amount of supply that's in the market probably has already taken into account somewhat of any recessionary risks. we're not operating at delta anywhere close to what we used to operate in the past, and that's why the demand of our product and the pricing for the product has been so strong.
our crystal ball is good for 90 to 120 days. after that, it gets a little murky. our advanced bookings don't go out too much further than that in large numbers. but from what we can see and what our big corporates are telling us is that the travel sector of the economy is going to be very strong through the quarter and into the new year.
so that's the best we can. i can't speak for the broader economy. i know there's some pretty significant macro shifts going on in spending out of goods and into services, which we are beneficiary of. of course, we contributed the last two years to the other side of that, and we're glad to see people back on the road.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
and then, if i could ask one more. just curious how you're thinking about share repurchases. like you can sort of see that becoming a political issue already. i'm just curious how much sort of -- the pushback we've already seen from certain lawmakers and labor groups, how much that factors into your thinking about that?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
our sole priority at delta is to make sure that any excess cash that we're generating is used to pay down debt. and we acquired a meaningful amount of debt during the pandemic. and we want to get our investment-grade rating back, as we've talked. so over the next couple of years, that will be our -- and beyond, by the way, not just the next couple of years, that will still be the top priority for any excess cash.
and of course, we'll also be using our cash to continue to invest in the business and invest in our people. so that's where the cash is going. i don't see any share repurchases happening here at delta for the foreseeable future.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
thanks.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from leslie josephs of cnbc.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
hi, good morning, everyone. delta has been putting in a lot of effort to position itself for a premium airline, and there's a lot of buyout into the premium cabins. longer term, do you see a need for basic economy anymore? and then, just second question, how much bigger would the airline be if it did have -- was it up-to-date in pilot training, hiring? and how many aircraft it had?
glen hauenstein -- president
basic economy is not a hard cabin. it's an availability of a fare, and we want to keep that in place. it's a very effective tool. we haven't used it as much historically because we've been so full.
but as we get to a more normalized environment, there probably will be more basic economy in -- available in '23 than there were in '24. and we created that because the way that the ultra-low-cost carriers price their products where they don't show you all of the add-ons, they show you a very low intro fare and then add on everything from carry-ons to soda. and so, we wanted to have a relatively de-counted product, although it's still far superior to the product that you buy on the ulccs. it doesn't have all the products and the upgradability that the higher fare structures do.
and it's a very effective competitive tool. but as i mentioned earlier, it's -- the fare structures are there, and they're either available because there -- we're not selling out on airplanes or they're not. and so, that's the way we've created it, and it's not a cabinet in and of itself. where the premium products are actually hard cabins.
they're comfort+ or delta premium select or delta one, which actually have physical attributes, as well as the other components. so --
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and leslie, on your second question, this summer, we operated roughly 15% below where we were in the summer of '19. and we said our goal is for next summer to close that gap and have our network fully restored. so i think that's a ballpark number of 15%. that doesn't mean we're going to have 15% more people or 15% more planes.
it's really just utilizing the people we already have because we're already at pretty close to 2019 staffing levels. and the fleet we have has taken a pretty significant utilization hit as we've reduced supplying and bringing it back. so it's really using the assets and the people we already have more efficiently. that's going to generate a meaningful amount of that growth.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
ok. and have the passengers used most of their vouchers and credit that they got during the pandemic? or are they still sitting on a lot of those? if you have any detail on how much or how many -- what the value is.
glen hauenstein -- president
we don't release any details, but there's still -- there's -- we have very long-dated expiration on that. so nothing is going to expire until the end of '24. and there's still a sizable number of credits out there.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from edward russell with skift.
edward russell -- journalist
hi. i want to ask what delta's plan is if the congress does not extend the waiver for the 737 max 10 cockpits that expires at the end of the year?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we -- i was asked this question on cnbc this morning, and i said there is a plan b. and of course, when we made the decision to buy the 10, we had a lot of conversations with boeing around that specific question because it's a big part of our capacity, and we want to make certain that we're not going to be left without an alternative. so we do have a plan b. we're not discussing what that plan b is, but there is a plan b with boeing in the event it doesn't get certified.
that said, we remain optimistic it will be certified.
edward russell -- journalist
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our next question from dawn gilbertson with wall street journal.
dawn gilbertson -- air travel reporter
hi. good morning. ed, i wanted to ask you about the dot's latest proposal on fee transparency. you guys and other airlines blasted it in 2014.
what is your take on this latest proposal? i know you haven't filed a formal comment yet. and secondly, what do you think the chances are of this going through? thank you.
peter carter -- executive vice president, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary
good morning, dawn. it's peter carter. what i would say in response to the proposal is we think that customers do have access to fee and pricing information. today, on the internet, we think our pricing is transparent.
we will be providing formal comment to the dot because one of the challenges with the rule as proposed is the way they're viewing transparency, they're expecting a carrier to provide a moment of making the search every single potential fee or price without regard to who's actually searching. so it may be a fee that's not relevant to the consumer, which, of course, could create quite a bit of confusion for consumers. so we'll be providing that input to the dot, and we hope that they obviously see that rule as something that's unnecessary to impose.
dawn gilbertson -- air travel reporter
thank you very much.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thank you, dawn. and we have time for one final question.
operator
thank you. we'll hear next from kelly yamanouchi with the atlanta journal constitution. kelly, your line is open. [operator instructions] all right.
hearing no response.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
all right, cody, we'll follow up with kelly later, but i think that is going to conclude our call. so thanks, everybody, for listening and participating.

all earnings call transcripts",0.9998,1.0,2022-10-13 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta air lines september quarter 2022 financial results conference call. my name is cody, and i'll be your coordinator. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, cody. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our september quarter 2022 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today are ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our cfo, dan janki. ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy.
glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. [operator instructions] today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings.
we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, julie, and good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us today. before we begin, i want to recognize all of those who have been impacted by hurricanes ian and fiona, including delta employees who live in the affected communities. we have contributed $600,000 to the red cross relief efforts and activated our delta care fund to take care of our employees who have suffered loss.
delta will continue to support our people and our communities the recovery and rebuilding. the demand for air travel remains very strong, and that is reflected in today's results and outlook. we generated earnings of $1.51 per share in the september quarter. our results mark clear financial progress as we report the highest quarterly revenue in delta's history, 3% above the third quarter of 2019 and $1.5 billion of operating income, generating a 12% margin.
this was our second quarter -- consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins. and importantly, we achieved these results despite record high fuel prices and on capacity only 83% restored relative to 2019. our customer satisfaction scores are running meaningfully above 2019, and loyalty to delta has never been stronger, with record skymiles acquisitions and american express results ahead of our plan. i want to sincerely thank the delta people for their great work in delivering these results and restoring our operational reliability through a very difficult summit.
delivering safe, reliable and on-time service for our customers remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than delta. we saw strong consistent improvement in our operating metrics throughout the quarter. for example, excluding the impact of hurricane ian, we ran a 99.9% domestic completion factor in september and month-to-date in october with 90% arrivals on time. to put that in context, out of 120,000 mainline flights over the last 45 days, we had just 108 cancellations in total, performance that is even better than our prepandemic levels.
and year-to-date, delta remains in the no. 1 industry position among our peer set in completion factor and on-time arrivals. after two years of delaying travel, it is clear that consumers are getting out and traveling the world. business travel continues to recover in line with our expectations as bookings have improved after labor day and companies reconnect with their teams and their customers.
and while consumer spend on experiences is growing, the airline industry revenues are still $20 billion to $30 billion below the historical trend against gdp, highlighting the significant opportunity still ahead. we expect our december quarter revenues to maintain this momentum, and we will be 5% to 9% higher than 2019. with strong demand, we expect earnings per share of $1 to $1.25 and a 9% to 11% operating margin. while we face numerous challenges and headwinds this year, delta has demonstrated its resilience.
we're ahead of our plan that we laid out for you last december on profitability and cash flow, and we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2022 this year. our priority over the next six months is to prepare for full network restoration by next summer, consistent with our original plan, but always conditioned on a continuing demand strength. this will support another meaningful step-up in profitability and cash flow next year as we stay on our path to earn over $7 of eps and $4 billion of free cash in 2024. we'll provide more details on our outlook for 2023 and progress toward our long-term targets at an investor meeting that we will host december 14 in new york.
as we think about our long-term plan, we had some really important achievements this quarter. building on delta's global network and partnerships, we strengthened our network with the recent dot approval of our joint venture with latam. together with latam, our jv will have the no. 1 market position in south america.
to support our best-in-class network, we continue to reshape our fleet and recently placed an order for 100 boeing 737-10 aircraft. we're also expanding the power of our loyalty ecosystem with the recently announced starbucks partnership, bringing two premier brands together. and this week, we announced a strategic partnership with an investment in joby aviation, aligning the industry's best airline with the innovation leader in developing evtol. joby shares our vision of providing customers a premium experience.
we're excited to help support joby's long-term vision of faster, more reliable and more sustainable transit to the airport. in closing, while we are mindful of macroeconomic headwinds, the travel industry is experiencing a countercyclical recovery. global demand is continuing to ramp as consumers shift spend to experiences, businesses return to travel and international markets continue to reopen. demand has not come close to being quenched by a hectic summer travel season.
at the same time, industry supply is constrained by aircraft availability, regional pilot shortages, and hiring and training needs. with record high fuel prices and increasing cost of capital, the hurdle rate is rising for incremental capacity across an industry that's still restoring its financial condition post pandemic. against this backdrop and coupled with meaningfully improved asset utilization, at delta, we are uniquely positioned to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2023. at the same time, we will remain nimble and have the tools to manage through any changes in the overall environment.
over the last decade, delta has structurally improved in significant ways, creating a trusted consumer brand built on a foundation as the most reliable airline globally driven by the very best professionals in the industry. and i truly believe that we are positioned to come through this period as a stronger airline than ever before. with that, let me hand it over to glen, who can provide more details on our commercial performance.
glen hauenstein -- president
thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. i want to first thank our employees for their hard work restoring our operations and delivering for our customers during a very busy summer travel season. demand for travel on delta remains strong. investments in our products, airport service and the liability are reshaping customer perceptions and driving record satisfaction scores.
brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry, and we're making meaningful progress against our multiyear commercial strategy. september quarter results reflect momentum in premium products and loyalty, supporting continued diversification of our revenues. this quarter, a record 54% of our total revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. we expect this to grow to 60% by 2024.
september quarter revenues of $12.8 billion is a new quarterly record and 3% higher than 2019 on 17% less capacity. hurricane ian impacted revenues by approximately $70 million, with the impact evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. total unit revenues finished 23.4% higher versus 2019, improving three points sequentially as international demand accelerated. demand was strong throughout the quarter, with premium revenue growth outpacing main cabin by 10 points.
delta premium select is performing well ahead of our expectations as we expand the offering to more of our international network every day. we see continued runway ahead with the return of business travel, complementing strength in premium leisure. our growing loyalty base drives high-margin revenue and supports continued growth in our valuable co-brand relationship with american express. skymiles acquisitions are running 40% above 2019 with over 60% of our passenger revenues now generated by skymiles members.
in the third quarter, record spend and strong acquisitions on our amex co-brand cards resulted in $1.4 billion of amex remuneration. this was 37% higher than 2019, and we now expect 2022 remuneration of $5.5 billion, further reinforcing our confidence in achieving our $7 billion target in 2024. other revenue streams continue to perform well, with cargo revenue up 27% and mro revenues up 4% versus '19. business travel continues to improve.
we expect corporate sales recovery in the december quarter in the low to mid-80s at a system level. importantly, less recovered sectors like banking, consulting and consumer services have all seen double-digit growth post labor day, helping bring new york largely in line with domestic system. we have growing confidence that while there will be changes, corporate travel will fully recover. and increased workplace flexibility is creating new travel patterns.
our recent corporate survey validates our perspective with nearly 90% of accounts expecting near travel to stay the same or increase as we move into the fourth quarter. that optimism is also reflected in gbta's recent travel survey where 80% of respondents expect travel volumes to increase in 2023 compared to '22. on the consumer side, domestic revenue remains well ahead of 2019, with international consumer revenue now fully restored. international is being led by the transatlantic where revenue was 12% higher than 2019 on 89% capacity restoration.
pacific was the most improved entity in the quarter and generated the highest unit revenue growth. we are encouraged by how the pacific recovery is progressing, led by strong demand in our hub in korea and to australia. and we expect continued improvement as japan reopens. turning to the december quarter.
bookings for travel and spending on our co-brand cards continue to show healthy trends. we expect our revenue compared to 2019 will continue to improve in fourth quarter, up 5% to 9% on 8% to 9% less capacity. demand for transatlantic travel is extending well into the fall. starting in october, we anticipate flying more transatlantic capacity than 2019, making it the first geography to exceed 2019 capacity levels.
and while european currencies are down versus the dollar, foreign yields are more than offsetting the foreign exchange impact, and u.s. demand is driving higher u.s. point of sale than 2019. october and november revenue is trending well.
the december month will be impacted by an elongated period between the holidays and more return travel than usual pushed into january. demand for the entire holiday period, however, is very robust. fourth quarter unit revenues are expected to be up mid-teens versus 2019 as we continue to restore international capacity and increase domestic stage length. during the pandemic and through 2022, we set out a goal to improve our share in coastal gateways to become the leading global carrier in these important revenue centers, and i am proud of the team for successfully achieving this goal.
looking to 2023, we are shifting our focus to our core hubs, atlanta, minneapolis, detroit and salt lake city, with approximately 75% of domestic seat growth dedicated to full restoration of our higher-margin core hubs. as our plan progresses, delta will continue to prioritize our people and our customers, and extend our competitive advantages. in closing, we're coming into the final quarter of the year with a healthy demand backdrop, running the most reliable operation and exceeding our key commercial goals. and with that, i'd like to turn it over to dan to talk about the financials.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
thank you, glen, and good morning to everyone. the september quarter demonstrated progress on our financial priorities to drive margin improvement and reduce debt. we reported a $1.5 billion operating profit, and that's on a margin of 11.6%, our second consecutive quarter with a double-digit operating margin. that is on a network that's 17% smaller than 2019.
our non-unit fuel costs were 22.5% higher, in line with guidance, excluding the impact of the hurricane on capacity. the refinery generated profit of $192 million partially offsetting the impact of volatile crack spreads. gross capex spend was $1.5 billion as we took delivery of 11 aircraft, including five a321neos, which are generating margins approximately 10 points higher than the aircraft they're replacing. capex was lower than our guidance, with fewer delivery -- with a few delivery delays, and we now expect capex spend of $5.7 billion for the full year.
we ended the quarter with $20.5 billion of adjusted net debt. we repaid $1.8 billion of debt during the quarter as we continue to manage down our maturities over the next several years. this brings our debt repayment to over $4 billion year-to-date, reducing our run rate interest expense and reflecting our continued focus on returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024. for the december quarter, we expect earnings to be between $1 and $1.25 per share and an operating margin of 9% to 11%.
fuel prices remain volatile. with the most recent move up last week, we expect fourth quarter adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.35 and $3.55. this includes $105 million contribution from the refinery equating to a $0.23 per gallon benefit. we expect the december quarter unit cost to be 12% to 13% higher than 2019.
this is a 10-point improvement sequentially and shows clear progress as capacity restoration increases from the low 80% to low 90%. it's taken significant resources to rebuild the airline with industry-leading reliability. we are nearing the final stages with the workforce now in line with 2019. from here, we expect further benefit from scale as we reach full network restoration and better utilization of our fleet, our hubs and our workforce.
the incremental cost to restore additional capacity is low as the resources are already in place, reducing unit costs. as glen noted, much of our growth next year will be in our lowest cost core hubs through increased mainline aircraft utilization. approximately 75% of our domestic seat growth in 2023 will be in our core hubs, including 45% from atlanta alone. further, between inefficiencies and rebuild expenses, we are carrying over $1 billion of excess costs in 2022.
with the teams in place and the operations running reliable, we are seeing early improvements in efficiency. october metrics are pacing ahead of september, and we expect to return to historic levels as elevated training and the network normalized next summer. achieving scale while restoring efficiency are delta's largest casm levers. these are within our control based on the pace of restoration and running an operation in line with delta's standard of excellence.
we know managing cost down is the best protection from economic uncertainty, and it is a companywide priority. we are making progress restoring our financial foundation with significant profitability and positive cash flow this year. as we fully restore our network and unit costs improve, we expect another step-up in earnings next year, resulting in meaningful cash flow to further reduce our debt on path to our long-term targets. we are confident in delivering a competitive cost structure and our 2024 mid-teen margin target.
in closing, i want to recognize the delta entire global team for the operational improvements they delivered over the past few months. we are on track for meaningful and well-deserved employee profit-sharing payments, and i look forward to celebrating with our employees in february. now with that, i'll turn it back to julie for q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question is coming from catherine o'brien from goldman sachs. your line is live.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, everyone. it's so good to be back. so, maybe i'll start with a question on the capacity bottlenecks that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, ed. so, you know, i know delta itself has made a lot of progress in hiring and cutting through a large wave of training, but there are other constraints outside of the airline industry's control with aircraft delivery slower than planned, and, you know, aviation infrastructure still fairly strapped at airports and the faa.
now, i know the answer will be different for delta than some of your peers who are further behind in their pilot hiring. but how do you think about the timeline to remove some of these bottlenecks across the industry that aren't directly in the airline's control? and i guess, really, what i'm asking is, you know, do you expect there to be continued tension between supply and demand over the medium term? just how do you think about those rolling off? thanks so much.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, katie, and welcome back. yeah, i think you summed it up well. and i mentioned that the capital markets day last month that while we, at delta, and i think the industry broadly provides you our capacity expectations, i think the expectations have quotation marks around them. and they do feel still a little bit more aspirational than -- because there are a number of things that are outside of our control.
we're doing our very best to get our people in place. the hiring is strong. we have the team assembled. we need to get them through, principally our pilots, through the training, the limited training devices and school house that we have available to us.
we expect by the summer that we will be in position to have not just get through most of that bottleneck, but then the large resource drain that it takes with respect to all of the training that our existing team has to do to train our new employees, whether that's pilots or flight attendants, mechanics, the airport's reservations. it doesn't matter where in the system you sit. that's hard to see. i can appreciate that if you're sitting in your chair.
but it's very meaningful here on the airline. and then, by summer, we hope at delta that we'll be able to be back 100%. i also use the term fragile last month when speaking about the aviation system as we continue to return to the skies. and i think we've seen, just in the last few weeks, a couple of the restorations of that fragility.
so, we're going to continue to do our best to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capability so that we can deliver a great product for our customers and provide all the tools and support for our employees.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's great. so, helpful, ed. and if i could maybe just for my follow-up, glen, i know 75% of this year's growth is out of your core hubs. can you help us think about rising performance at your core hubs versus the rest of your network? or even better, since we know it's lower-cost capacity, can you help us think about, you know, the margin differential of adding capacity in core hubs versus competitive coastal hubs? thank you so much.
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. i think we outlined that at the investor day. and core hub is about 10 points higher than coastal hubs, and 10 points in margin, and about 20 points in terms of pricing. and i think as we continue to build our core hubs out, we will see that's one of the things we're counting on is excess acceleration of profitability in those core hubs and driving efficiency through getting them back to scale.
as we mentioned in our investor day, we are already at scale in our coastal cities. that was our priority just because we thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity during the pandemic. and so, that was our priority to ensure that we came out in a good position there. i think we're very happy with the positions we've established there.
and now it's back to the core where we think it's actually easier lifting.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from ravi shanker from morgan stanley. your line is live.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. ed, you said in your prepared remarks that you've never seen a more constructive industry backdrop. black swan events aside, what do you see are probably the biggest risks or things to watch out for, for the industry in 2023? is it your response on kind of infrastructure and things that's outside of your control, or what are you looking at?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, ravi. i -- that's right. i think the most important thing at delta we can do is to continue to restore confidence back to the traveling public. we know the traveling public wants to travel, an outsized amount that we see continuing.
and we have to do our very best not to disappoint them as they return to the skies. i think 2022 was very difficult in that regard. demand clearly exceeded our ability to supply it for lots of ways, including in the service levels with the exceptional degree of service that we want to provide our customers. and i think we all in the industry owe it to our customers to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capabilities.
i think that's the single biggest thing that we all need to pay attention to. and so, i wouldn't call it a black swan risk other than just trying to stay within our capability.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and maybe as a follow-up maybe for glen. can you just unpack your thoughts on corporate in the near term a little bit more? i think that's obviously one of the big-focus areas for investors right now. you said 96% of corporate in your survey say that they're going to flat to up in the near term, but obviously macro is really choppy.
we saw some of the hotel data kind of coming into january take a bit of a step-down. what are you seeing in terms of booking curve? any signs at all on cracks and corporate demand given where macro is?
glen hauenstein -- president
we've had our highest post-pandemic days in terms of corporate booking over the last week or 10 days. so, we see a very strong post-holiday demand set. we're in a kind of a strange period right now because your 19 -- this is an mlk weekend. mlk weekend was next weekend.
so, i think once we get past mlk, we'll give you a better view. but we're counting on it to stay in that roughly 80%. that's not -- the survey would indicate that it's better than that. so, i think that's -- if it does materialize better than that, that's upside from a forward-looking forecast.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from scott group from wolfe research. your line is live.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. so, glen, if i look at the rasm guide for q1, down about 6% just in absolute terms from q4. that's worse than normal q4 to q1 seasonality.
any color on that? and then, when do we really start to see this hub tailwind show up in rasm?
glen hauenstein -- president
quarter over quarter, we have a 2-point increase in domestic stage. so -- and that again is unique to delta, and we think that's about 1 point of pressure from the 19 down to the 16. there's another international mix, length of haul changing internationally as well. so, that's another point.
and so, then we're thinking about this as really being sequentially about 1-point difference to get from a 91% restoration all the way up to 99% restoration. so, our core-for-core same-store sales, we're actually seeing first quarter being stronger than fourth quarter with that sequential improvement from february being better than january and march being better than february. so, i think we're sitting in a pretty exciting place right now as we look at how '23 is starting. the rebuild of the core.
you know, we wish we could do it sooner. again, i think our priority has been to make sure that we can sustain industry-leading operations. and so, that's going to work throughout the year. i think when we talked about it at the investor day, we didn't really give you color that this is not a first quarter event.
while there's some rebuild domestically in the core, the major rebuilds, we expect, for example, atlanta, which was about 85% last year in terms of seats to be close to 95% by summer and then 100% by fall, with minneapolis close to atlanta and detroit a little bit behind. so, we're working on that. that's our priority. and we will get there, we believe, by fall.
but it really doesn't impact significantly the first quarter's core.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then, just for dan, just help bridge us from casm, up 3 to 4 in q1, down 2 to 4 for the year. you mentioned maintenance. how much does that hurt q1? how much of that then help the back half? any color here? thank you.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah, certainly, there's two pieces in there, maintenance being one. it's about a 2-point headwind in the first quarter and first half, and it's driven by engine induction levels and scope of work related to that. as you get into the back half of the year, that's a 2-point to 3-point benefit year over year. so, a 5 point progression from beginning to end.
and then, the second piece of that is related to the completion of our rebuild and those rebuild costs stepping down. most of our rebuild, 85% of that cost, is in the first half of the year. we don't have that in the back half of the year. and as glen just talked about, one of the enablers of that efficiency is as we restore the core hubs, these low-cost subs, low cp, most cost-competitive as we put that capacity, and that drives efficiency of our assets and our workforce.
that is 5 points. so, the 5 points related to that and the 5 points related to maintenance is 10-point progression as you go through the year from the beginning to the end. and that drives that continuous cadence improvement as you go through the quarters.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
helpful. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies. your line is live.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, everyone. first, i wanted to maybe ask about just profitability levels. you finished the year with 8% margins and are guiding to q1 with 4 to 6. and given the full year guide, how do we think about margin progression throughout the year?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
it will. you know, part of it is tied to the cost progression. and as you see that progression being up, and i said you've got about a 10-point improvement in costs from beginning to end. that will drive your expansion of margins throughout the year as you progress, along with what then glen talked about, which was the commercial rebuild related to the core.
so, you'll see a progression. certainly, year over year, the improvement versus the comp that we're coming off of drives a material improvement here in the first quarter over $1 billion pre-tax. a big part of the step-up in earnings year over year, but you'll also see improvement as we go through the year.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, just maybe one follow-up related to that, just margin progression. i think, ed, you mentioned high-margin pacific routes opening up. i think it was australia and korea.
you know, what are one to two items we should watch for as we see that international recovery help margin momentum?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
our international recovery is well underway. and if you think about europe, we'll actually be bigger in the trans-atlantic this year than we were in '19 by about 8 points in terms of seats. early advanced bookings for that are incredibly strong, so we're very pleased with how that's developing. and so, what's really left to reopen is china.
and that's -- we're not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of capacity to china. we're going to be very mindful to see how demand warrants and how this opens up. but that's the big question mark, i think, in terms of international demand for 2023 that we don't know yet. for others, we're very confident that we have a good path forward that it will get us back to '19 with bigger, better margins.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
and, you know, i think as we talked about it at investor day, the multi-year progression on international, the structural elements here, right to the next-generation fleet that we're at reconfiguration of more premium seats with dps, better cargo capability, stronger partner network. all those are systematic drivers, not only in this year, but really on a multi-year basis.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
and if you go back in our history, not to go into too much detail, but we had a multi-year restructure of our asia capacity. and that has been a drag on earnings for many years leading up to the pandemic. and now, as we come out of that, we feel like our restructuring is really done in earnest. and so, we should see really good improvements and pacific profitability moving forward.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from jamie baker from jpmorgan. your line is live.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. i'm glad it's been a while since we visited the topic of domestic and international rasm premiums. we know, you know, what those metrics were pre-covid. there's obviously been, you know, quite a bit of international upheaval since then, a bit of domestic change.
and, of course, the premium market at least is stronger than what i was anticipating in 2019. how should we think about the magnitude of delta's rasm premiums going forward. and any related timing?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think right now, we're sitting probably at a low point relative to the industry, given our stage length and the way we rebuilt the airline. and i would expect to gain a couple 2 to 3 points domestically back as we get toward the back half of the year on how we rebuild the airline. so, that's how i view it.
i'm pleased with -- at a macro level, i'm -- or at an individual flight level, i'm pleased with where we are. when you add it all up, the sum total looks like you're taking a step backwards. but i think it's really the way we've done it, rather than a structural look away from delta or anything that we're losing customers. so, i think we're in a good spot for that.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. and second, for dan, you know, as we think about the order book, particularly on the widebody side, considering the oem backlogs, you know, that katie -- welcome back, by the way, mentioned in her question, how should we be thinking about the cadence of capex in coming years? you know, we tend to model you on a normalized basis. but, you know, one of your competitors is on a capex holiday, another right now is on a capex bender.
you know, i'm just trying to assess whether 2024 represents a potential peak in cash flow in light of future aircraft needs.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
it gets steady as it goes. you know, we've been very consistent, very deliberate, very disciplined related to capex. we certainly had this period where this past year, in 2022, there was some catch up in there. we're continuing to do that here in 2023 for what was deferred for a couple of years.
but i think as you exit 2024, you know, you're normalized now. at the same time, we're getting bigger as an airline and growing from that perspective. but, you know, i think it's a good foundation for us as it relates to where we're stepping off in 2024.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah jamie, this is ed. i'd agree with dan's comments. don't forget, we are exclusively taking airbus equipment over the, you know, last couple of years and next couple of years pretty much. we'll be back with the max starting in '25.
so, we did not have any supply interruption of any note over the last couple of years through the pandemic this year or the years going forward. so, there's a consistency. and i'm confident you're going to see a -- you're not going to see any jumps or any, you know, significant declines. you know, we're ensuring that we're staying within our sweet spot here on the fleet.
jamie baker -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
just the answer we were looking for. thank you, everybody. take care.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi. your line is live.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, and thanks for the time. maybe just to start, with glen, on trans-atlantic, typically, this is a pretty quiet time of the year. but it appears the industry is sort of doing less seasonal shaping or kind of deseasonalizing trans-atlantic, which probably makes sense in light of rebuild for the summer.
can you just talk about what you're seeing in trans-atlantic less about this summer and more about, you know, getting from here to there?
glen hauenstein -- president
right. well, there's not a lot of room between here and there. we're seeing really robust bookings for march and beyond. so, it's really -- you know, if i look at how we view the trans-atlantic, there's april through october's peak spring.
march is getting to be a peak month these days. so, that leaves you really the nonholiday weeks in november and the nonholiday weeks in january and february as really your lull periods. and so, you know, how we've shaped it this year is we've had a bigger trans-atlantic for 2019. we had some operational issues in amsterdam.
excluding those, we were very pleased with the results in the off-peak season. and it's setting up really well. because i think one of the things that you forget about building up for the summer is the first few weeks for the high point-of-sale u.s. travel are always throwaway weeks because you've got a, you know, significant amount of outbound traffic and very light inbound traffic.
so, getting those out of the way earlier in the season and really allowing the summer peak to be even more robust than it has been before is i think that we're shaping. so, i don't know if i answered your question, but i'd say we really like what we saw. there are things we're going to do differently next year. there are learnings from this year that we can improve on.
so, excited about those learnings. and i'm really excited about the summer peak season here. we think it's going to be a record-breaker.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you, glen. and then, just on fuel, maybe this is ed or dan. you know, you own a refinery. can you talk a little bit about your outlook for jet fuel? and i'm not asking for guidance.
we can obviously see that. but just with respect to the unusually high crack spreads and refining margins, which, you know, week to week look like we're going to get relief, and then that relief sort of goes away. obviously, you have a hedge in that regard. but i wondered if you could talk kind of intermediate term about when we see sort of refining margin relief.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, you saw it. you know, constrained market throughout 2022 did elevate it. certainly, it was disrupted significantly in the second quarter, particularly.
we don't anticipate it being at those levels for the current year given that. but i would say, for the next 12 to 18 months, i think you're at least in a period where you're structurally constrained. you know, the global flows for both oil and refined product have changed things that used to revert both gasoline, diesel, and jet coming out of europe into the u.s. aren't taking place.
utilization of refineries are high. and you get disruptions. you've seen it as winter storms came through in december. and incredibly low temperatures, you know, refineries were impacted.
and you're seeing the rippling effect here in january and the unusual nature, even in the last seven to 10 days, where the physical market is short. jet, you know, many times throughout 2022 was diesel, and you see a spike. and then, they -- as the refineries get the utilization back up and optimized, you get a balancing. but they're still tight, and we expect them to stay elevated.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from savi syth from raymond james. your line is live.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, glen. could you talk a little bit more about, you know, what you're seeing on the corporate demand side across the international entities? and just as you get to the summer, i realize it's early days, but where do you expect kind of capacity be restored across these entities?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, i think we talked a little bit about that in the previous question. we expect the trans-atlantic to be about 108% restored to 2019 levels. so, we'll be bigger than 2019. most of that is in gauge as we bring in the newer, more efficient fleets.
we have some exciting departures. we haven't loaded our entire summer schedule yet. that'll be announced over the next eight to 10 days. there's a few more things we need to put back in.
and then, in the pacific, absent of china, we are more than rebuilt in australia, we're more than rebuilt in korea, and we are about 75% rebuilt in japan. we expect to be somewhere between 75% and 100% rebuilt in japan if we do or don't receive slot waivers. if we do receive slot waivers, we'll probably stay in that 75%. if we don't, we'll go back to 100%.
and then, china is the big question mark, as i mentioned earlier. we just don't know what's going to go on there with demand. so, we're not going to get ahead of that and publish a china schedule for the summer that we don't know if we can fly, and we don't know if the demand will be there. so, we'll let demand drive what we're going to fly in china.
and then, last but not least, in latin, we are very close to fully restored in latin right now with the deep south really starting to turn on with our partners in latam and getting some really, really positive early results on that. so, you know, i think other than china, we are fully restored internationally. and we see international restoration where countries are open, and it's very similar to domestic at about 80%.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
i appreciate that. and just as kind of a quick follow-up, just on the kind of change fees and the revenue that you're seeing here, the dropping of the change fees, what kind of an impact is that having as you kind of think about the network or the revenue? and, you know, will it be different once things are fully restored versus which is where it is today?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah, change fees accounted for almost $1 billion of revenue in the pre-pandemic world. and we were on a path, even absent of the pandemic, to change, change fees. they had become onerous. people didn't like them.
and, you know, trying to give customers what they want, we were on a path to a different approach. that got accelerated. and i think we're very happy with where we are today giving customers choice in how they want to fly. and i'd say we're counting on about half of that $1 billion to be replaced by people who want flexible, fully refundable at time of purchase, which is an option that they're choosing as opposed to it being imposed on them.
and the rest of that is then coming from a higher share of total customer base and upsells, more than covering to produce the record revenues that we expect this year.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
make sense. all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from conor cunningham from melius research. your line is live.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
everyone, thank you for the time. just on the question that scott talked about, the bridge on the cost side, i don't think you mentioned gauge or asset utilization improving throughout there. can you just provide some color around where you expect those two metrics to kind of be meaningful tailwinds as you move throughout the year? the reason i ask is that there's a lot of changes on the regional side. i would think that that would be a pretty big tailwind from you.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yeah, the main line asset utilization increases about mid single digit, about 5%, as we progressed through the year. so, we get the benefit associated with that. and as we talked about in investor day, we continue to get the benefit associated with gauge.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
ok.
glen hauenstein -- president
and related to regional flying, as you know, we have about a third of our regional flight, the plane that is not being flown today. and that's also one of the disparities between seat restoration and capacity restoration. we're not expecting a significant increase of that until the end of '23 and into '24. so, we're going to be carrying that --
dan janki -- chief financial officer
we're carrying that underutilization regional network. absolutely. in our run rate.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
ok. ok. that makes sense. and then, on the amex targets, i'm a little surprised that those aren't being revised up, you know, from 6.5 to 5.5.
i mean, that's basically mirroring the capacity growth year over year. and i would just think that there would be some outperformance just given the fact that that portfolio's grown a fair bit. can you just talk about like what you need to see to push those targets up? or did you just see a lot of pull-forward in consumer spend that kind of inflated the 2022 number? just trying to unpack that a little bit. thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
well, we're pretty excited about hitting a $6.5 billion number. hopefully, there's upside to that. i think -- it's january. we don't want to commit to that.
but, you know, we're ahead of our long-term goals for that. and we continue to find ways to accelerate our long-term goals. and i think next year, or maybe even june, we're going to give you what's beyond the $7 billion because our first marker was how do you get to 7 billion. and when we said that, i think it was a daunting task for us.
it was a daunting task for the team. we're there. right. and i think the question really for us and our investors is ""ok, you're at the 7 billion.
what's next?"" and that's what we've got to be working on, showing you that we're not done here.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. and the other thing, conor, is that, you know, this is not driven by capacity, as you can appreciate. it's driven by the spend on the portfolio. so, that's a pretty sizable increase in portfolio spend as well.
conor cunningham -- melius research -- analyst
good problem to have. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from helane becker from cowen. your line is live.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator, and hi, team. thank you. sort of a question about techops, pre-pandemic, you guys were building that business out. it was going to be a more than $1 billion revenue business at some point.
how are you thinking about that coming out of the pandemic and into sort of the middle part of this decade into the end? or is that something that is another focus, or is that being supplanted by the other revenues that you are talking about?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, helane. how are you? this is ed. we are --
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm good.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
incredibly excited about your question and the mro. and in fact, we made great progress during the pandemic to continue to accelerate that vision when we signed a deal to acquire the leap as part of the max deal. so, we now have basically all the new engine technologies on our platform with exclusive arrangements and opportunities for third-party work that will extend over the next 20 years. obviously, in the short term, our focus is on -- to every extent, we have labor, and we have supply challenges focusing on the delta metal and continuing to get the airline itself back up and running.
so, the mro has taken a little bit of a backseat over the short term. but we continue to make the investments where we have got the commitments from all of our partners on the engine side. and this is something you are going to hear a fair bit about in june when we look at the strategic discussion that we are looking to create.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
right, in june. ok. that's going to be really helpful. and then, ed, can i please ask you, in june, if you will also update us on your diversity and inclusion targets? we talked a lot about that pre-pandemic.
and then during the pandemic, you have obviously hired 25,000 new people. you mentioned that in your prepared remarks. can you also at some point update us on how that's going and whether you are meeting your own internal goals? you don't have to share those with us. but if you can share with us how it's coming along, that might be helpful.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
we will certainly do that. and that was already in the plan, helane, to go through that in june. the good news is that we are making great progress, and we will share our targets because we share them publicly.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's awesome. thanks so much, team.

operator
thank you. your next question is coming from andrew didora from bank of america. your line is live.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. first question for glen, i guess, based on my math, it seems like you are assuming prasm could start to decline sort of in the high single digits year over year as you move through 2023 to kind of get to your 15% to 20% revenue outlook. what drives that assumption particularly, given kind of the rasm benefit you should have from your mid-continent growth strategy?
glen hauenstein -- president
i think when we look at the progression through the quarter, we had some very extenuating circumstances last second quarter and early third quarter with fuel running up over $120 a barrel. and as we think about how we do fuel recapture on the way up, we also as inflation cools down and as fuel comes down, we are not going to keep all of that. we are going to keep as much of it as we can, and we are not anticipating that big mobile and fuel, which is driving the sequential decrease. so, we will see how it actually rolls out.
and hopefully, it's better than that. but that's how we are thinking about how the year progresses in terms of absolute unit revenues.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. that makes sense. and then, i'd just ask you kind of strategically here, glen. as you see -- as you have seen the revenue environment continue to show this strength pretty much since kind of almost a year ago, are you seeing any changes in behavior from any of your competitors that may show that they are acting differently today than they would have pre-pandemic? thank you.
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah. we don't really talk about how our competitors behave. i think what we have seen is we have seen a very big shift in how and why people travel and trying to stay ahead of that in our own planning and make sure that we are capturing where people want to go and what products they want to buy and that's really our continued focus. and it's been a very interesting journey.
and as you look at individual market levels, we are very different sizes than we were pre-pandemic based on where our customers want us to take them these days.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from mike linenberg from deutsche bank. your line is live.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
oh, hey. good morning, everyone. hey, glen, just a quick question sort of following up on conor's on loyalty. it feels like with the free wi-fi, this is going to be a banner year for skymiles.
i think last year, $8.5 million. how do we think about the conversion of number of skymiles to ultimately those who uptake on the credit card. i think last year, it was like an 8-1 ratio. is that kind of what it's been historically?
glen hauenstein -- president
yeah. i think that's about right. that's one of the -- we see the more engaged the customer is with delta, the higher their satisfaction is. and so, that's really part of that ecosystem that we are really trying to grow is skymiles is an entry point.
of course, as everybody knows it's free. and now, they have an incentive to do that because there's an immediate benefit to join because you get the free wi-fi. and so, how do we translate that ultimately into more loyal customers who eventually will wind up getting some of our other products. and that's really what our flywheel is right now and how we are going to continue to press forward in terms of loyalty.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. very good. and then, just second question, dan, you know, you talked about nonops, the 470 million headwind. obviously, non-cash pension expense.
maybe there's some other items. how do we think about through the year. is that ratably? is it just lumpy? and what tax rate should we be using on march quarter full year? thank you.
dan janki -- chief financial officer
yes, 1.3 for the year. the first quarter, think of it being closer to -- if it was ratable, it would be about 3.30 a quarter. first quarter will be a little bit higher. think about it as 3.60 to 3.65 associated with it.
and tax rate continues to be consistent, right in that 24% to 24.5%.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
we will now go to our final analyst question.
operator
certainly. your next question is coming from brandon oglenski from barclays. your line is live.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
keep it to one as well. dan, can you talk about your normal amortization this year, which i think is about $2.5 billion relative to the $2 billion of free cash flow that you guys are anticipating? and, you know, what are your options here, especially in a higher interest rate environment? how does that change your capital priorities in any way?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
normal -- you know, yes. we have normal maturities at 2.4. we had 1.8 this past year, and we ended up retiring $4.5 billion of debt. ken and the team were opportunistic in regards to debt that we can take out that we think is higher cost and has good economic payback associated with it.
and given our liquidity position, as we progress through this year, we will continue to look at those options. there are certainly a number out there that are targets for us, but we will either do it through how we have done it with through tenders. but also, just as you go open market repurchases and being smart and going after the higher cost debt, that's a priority. we want to drive down that nonop interest line over time, and the team is good at it.
they have done it, did it for a decade, they will continue to do it.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
and i guess, dan, how does a higher interest rate environment here change your capital priorities, if at all?
dan janki -- chief financial officer
about changing it, i think, it does -- when it may change in regards to how you look at some of your debt. some of them that are off of libor and floating have become more attractive to retire in certain situations. so -- but we are continuing to be focused on, as you know, at reinvesting back in the business, but also this path to deleveraging. so, continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt, and drive down those leverage ratios.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
all right. thank you.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
that will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. i will now turn it over to tim mapes, our chief marketing and communications officer, to start the media questions.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, julie. matt, if you don't mind, could we reiterate for the members of the media, the practice for getting in the call queue and in addition to thanking each of them for their time this morning. just remind everyone around one question and one follow-up, so we can get through as many of these as we could please. thank you.

[operator instructions] your first question is coming from claire bushey from financial times. your line is live.
claire bushey -- reporter
hi. i was wondering, what needs, in your opinion, to happen at the faa so that what happened on wednesday doesn't happen again?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
hi, claire. it's ed. i missed the first part of your question. your question is what does the faa need to do in order to ensure --
claire bushey -- reporter
so that --
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
no repeat of wednesday?
claire bushey -- reporter
correct.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, if you saw my comments this morning on cnbc, i think it's very clear that there has to be a call to action among our political leaders, the congress and the white house to fund and properly provide the faa the resources they need to do the job. we have long talked about the need for modernization of our air traffic control systems. i think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the faa has faced when you have aging systems that aren't as resilient as they need to be. you have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated.
and staffing levels, you know, not where they need to be. so, faa i know is doing the very best they can with what they have, but we need to stand behind the faa, and we need to take them off the kind of year-by-year funding that seems like they go through that's caught up in political negotiations and realize the importance of having a strong aviation infrastructure and the importance of that to our economy, as well as our public.
claire bushey -- reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from alison sider from wall street journal. your line is live.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
hey. thanks so much. i guess sort of a related question, but i guess, curious, how much do you think that the infrastructure and aerospace issues are likely to be a constraint on growth for the industry overall, you know, whether it vulnerability of technical systems and lack of redundancy or just controller staffing or what have you, you know, how impactable do you expect that to be going forward?
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
well, it's a current constraint on our ability to grow as an industry. you see the length of flight times they are taking to complete missions. you see some of the challenges the air traffic controllers have when you get into congested space in the northeast or down in florida. there's been a lot -- it's just even during the pandemic itself some real challenges that we have experienced.
so, there's no question that the investment in a modernized air traffic control system will drive a tremendous amount of efficiencies, as well as growth, which will mean better service for the american public.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
thanks. and i guess can you talk a little bit about sort of what sort of systems or backup or its own redundancy delta has, like if there was another outage, you know, of the notam system like we saw earlier this week? is that something that delta can kind of deal with or work around? or, you know, is that something you need to have? or -- yeah, if there's anything you can share on that.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
yeah. the notam system that went down is an essential system. and no airline would fly without having that capability. interestingly, at delta, we had and have a long -- a fairly old backup technology that does see that.
and we were able to keep some of the notam information flowing to delta. so, we probably had a little better opportunity to fly during this stoppage as compared to anyone else. but out of deference to the faa and making certain that we gave them the ability to make the decisions, we didn't utilize that backup system. but it's an important part of our resiliency and redundancy.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
thank you.

thank you. your next question is coming from kelly yamanouchi from the atlanta journal-constitution. your line is live. kelly yamanouchi, your line is live.
your next question is coming from mary schlangenstein from bloomberg news. your line is live.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
hi. thank you. i just wanted to see if i could get you to talk a little bit more about your comments about business bookings remaining steady. it seems like the 80% recovered level in the december quarter is what you had been saying previous to that.
and i wanted to see if you have got any sort of an outlook beyond the march quarter that gives you confidence that that corporate recovery is not going to stall at some level?
glen hauenstein -- president
you know, we do those corporate surveys, and that's why we do them to see what our corporate partners are thinking about in terms of future travel. and it was actually -- the last one we did, which is for future travel, was the best survey we have had since pre-pandemic in terms of their enthusiasm that more people would be flying in future months than we are flying in current or past months. as i said in the call, we are not counting on that in our current revenue forecast because, sometimes, that doesn't come to fruition. but there's a sense of optimism from this pent-up demand for business travel that we see could potentially offset any weakness in the general economy.
and we are taking a very cautious look, and we are counting on it being stable and not growing dramatically. but it looks like people think it will grow.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
mary, this is ed.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
great.
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
i -- you know, you see in our country a lot of businesses struggling to get their employees back into the office, and i think this is tied to that. as companies return and employees return to office, you are going to see another step-up, in my opinion, of return to more normal trends, including improved business travel. you think of a lot of the big accounts we serve are consultancies, legal firms, accounting firms. it's tough for them to get out on the road if they don't have the offices open of their clients and their customers.
so, i think that's the little bit of the choppiness that glen was referring to because that companies are intending to open and have had some -- there's been some stalls going on there. but i do think as we progress over the course of the year, you are going to see more and more of business being done like it used to be done than ever before.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. and if i can just follow up. i understand about your survey, but are there bookings that you can see at this point beyond the march quarter that gives you any idea of whether that weakness will continue? and then, when you said you are counting on that corporate demand being stable but not growing dramatically, that's a change though from what you had been seeing. is that correct, you had been seeing growth, but now, you are seeing it more stable?
glen hauenstein -- president
clearly, in the early parts of the pandemic recovery, we saw some accelerated growth. i think we have been pretty consistent at the past couple of quarters, and we see some stability in the booking curve at about 80% of revenue. so, as you know, business travel usually has the shortest advanced purchase windows and is mostly close-in. so, we would not have any further visibility beyond the next 60 to 90 days that would be of any significant help in charting that water.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from edward russell from skift. your line is live.
edward russell -- journalist
hi. thanks for taking my question. i wonder if you could comment on if delta saw any benefit from southwest airlines operational issues in december. was there an uptick in bookings, people buying less than tickets sent out? any color would be great.
glen hauenstein -- president
sure. as you know, we had our own weather operations during the peak christmas holiday travel period. and we saw, after that, when we were fully recovered and southwest was still not back in full swing, that we had an uptick in our bookings. that's trended in highly competitive with southwest market.
it's a little bit into january, but we think that will resolve itself over the next six to 12 months.
edward russell -- journalist
thank you.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, edward. matt, we have time for one final question, if we could, please.
operator
certainly. the last question is coming from robert silk from travel weekly. your line is live.
robert silk -- senior editor
yeah. hi. when you talk about getting back to full, you know, pre-pandemic capacity in your major hubs, are you talking about seats or flight numbers? and then, what percent of your gauge up, let's say, in atlanta, what will it be up this summer? and how do you think about managing crowds as you increase gauge and bring your flight numbers back up to where they were or beyond?
glen hauenstein -- president
right. we will probably not, for the next couple of years, see the flight numbers we did in 2019. we will get seat capacity restoration to 100%, which means that gauge will go up significantly. when you look at our fleet evolution, that was always our plan, was to continue to grow not by additional departures but by larger airplanes, more efficiency, less fuel burn, better products and services.
and so, that's really what we are intending on doing. the pandemic accelerated that. and so, you have got our average gauge up by double digits right now. that's partly because we keep taking larger airplanes or partly because the regional fleets are less restored.
and we think that will normalize out over the next 18 months. but we will probably not, for the foreseeable future, get back to the flight levels, although we will match or exceed, by the end of the year, the historic levels in terms of seat capacity.
robert silk -- senior editor
is there any -- with the higher gauge, do you end up with more crowded banks in terms of number of passengers? or is that a stage by having less flights --
glen hauenstein -- president
no. i think --
robert silk -- senior editor
if you have more crack --
glen hauenstein -- president
you know, that's why we have done these generational builds across our network is that we knew that bigger gauge was coming, we needed to accommodate it. and even, for example, here in atlanta, we worked closely with the city to reconfigure the de-concourse to be wider than any of the other concourses to accommodate that increased gauge. so, we have got short-, medium-, and long-term plans to accommodate those gauges, but a lot of that was in our generational builds across the network. and we don't think that it's going to be more crowded than it was in '19 or feel more crowded.
robert silk -- senior editor
ok. great. that's helpful. thank you, glen.
tim mapes -- chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, robert. matt, that will wrap our call for today. we are grateful for everyone's time and participation.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the delta airlines december quarter and full year 2022 financial results conference call. my name is matthew, and i'll be your coordinator. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to julie stewart, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
julie stewart -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, matthew. and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our december quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. joining us from atlanta today, our ceo, ed bastian; our president, glen hauenstein; our cfo, dan janki. ed will open the call with an overview of delta's performance and strategy, glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet.
after the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many as possible. after the analyst q&a, we will move to our media questions. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events.
all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in delta's sec filings. we'll also discuss non-gaap financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. you can find a reconciliation of non-gaap measures on the investor relations page at ir.delta.com.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ed. 
ed bastian -- chief executive officer
thank you, julie. good morning, everyone. we appreciate you joining us today. earlier, delta reported our full year results, including our december quarter earnings per share of $1.48 on record revenue.
that was 8% above 2019 levels. we generated a 12% operating margin, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins, pointing to the strength of our recovery. i want to sincerely thank the 90,000 strong delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers during a very busy holiday travel season. in my opinion, 2022 was the most difficult operational year in our history.
it was capped off by severe winter storms over the holidays. i am grateful to our employees for their great work to recover the operation while keeping our customers and each other safe. they are the reason our brand, and customer loyalty is at the top of the industry. our december quarter earnings per share and margins exceeded guidance, marking a strong close to a year where we made significant progress regarding restoration of our financial foundation.
for the full year, we reported earnings of $3.20 per share on $46 billion of revenue. we delivered pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, an improvement of more than $6 billion over 2021. delta's profitability led the industry in our nearly 100-year history. 2022 was our seventh highest result, even with a $1 billion loss in the first quarter.
we were pleased to report positive free cash flow for the year, which funded $6 billion of capital invested back into the business, and we repaid close to $5 billion in gross debt, sharing our success as a long-standing pillar of delta's culture. and i'm proud to announce that we'll be paying our employees $550 million in well-earned profit sharing come valentine's day. 2022 came in ahead of our plan on revenue, earnings, and cash flow, demonstrating strong execution in the first year of the three-year plan we laid out at the 2021 capital markets day. i'm incredibly proud of the team for rebuilding the world's best performing airline.
and importantly, we're not just building back, we're continuing to improve and extend our competitive advantages. delta's brand continued to strengthen in 2022 with record performance from our loyalty and co-brand card programs, and customer satisfaction scores consistently perform above pre-pandemic levels. through the year, we've hired and trained 25,000 new employees, now representing over a quarter of the total company. our team showed their operating talent and resilience as we retained our no.
1 position and completion factor and on-time arrivals among our peer set despite having so many new team members. the delta brand is centered on our safe, reliable, and exceptional service. and our operational excellence was recognized by cirium last week, which named us yet again the most on-time airline in north america. we fortified our international partnerships in 2022, positioning us for profitable international growth in the years ahead.
as detailed last month, expanding our international margins to domestic levels is an important opportunity for delta in the years to come. we've invested in the customer experience at every stage of the travel journey, from the continued refresh of our fleet with next-generation far more fuel-efficient aircraft, to generational airport rebuilds and technology investments that are providing our employees better tools and our customers a more seamless experience. and we continue to attract and partner with leading brands to grow our skymiles ecosystem and further enable customers to use their skymiles during travel and beyond. heading into 2023, our momentum continues.
at the consumer electronics show in las vegas just last week, we unveiled the next phase in our vision to connect the sky. starting february the 1st, delta will be the first major u.s. airline to provide fast, free, unlimited wi-fi to all through a free skymiles account. this will be available in nearly 80% of our u.s.
system to start and growing every week. by the end of next year, we expect to deliver this service seamlessly throughout the rest of our international and regional fleets. and we debuted delta sync, which will create personalized experiences and engagement opportunities on the free wi-fi portal. we're partnering with great brands like t-mobile and paramount plus, as well as building on our long-standing relationship with american express, to bring to life our vision of a more connected and personalized travel experience.
as a trusted consumer brand, delta continues to differentiate premium flying experience, building loyalty and supporting our ambition to transcend the industry. moving to our outlook. at our investor event last month, we provided full year 2023 guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year over year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share, and free cash flow of over $2 billion. we're affirming that guidance today and introducing our march quarter outlook, which glen and dan will provide in detail.
for the march quarter, we expect to deliver a 4% to 6% operating margin and improve our pre-tax income by more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. importantly, we are embedding the assumed impact of all labor cost increases throughout our guidance metrics. we are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with our pilots. but out of respect for the process, we will not be discussing the details of the agreement on today's call.
as i outlined last month, i've never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. demand remains strong as passengers return to the skies, and industry returns to the long-term trend to gdp, all while supply constraints continue. i believe our industry will see tens of billions of dollars of incremental demand in the next few years coming out of the pandemic. as the industry leader with a proven strategy and strong execution track record, delta is well positioned to build on our momentum in the new year.
we're confident in our ability to deliver significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow in 2023, consistent with the plan we laid out last month. and we are on track to deliver our 2024 targets of more than $7 of earnings per share and $4 billion of free cash flow. as always, we remain mindful of the macroeconomic trends and have demonstrated that we have the tools to effectively manage a changing economic climate. in closing, delta delivered in 2022, outperforming our plan and leading the industry operationally and financially.
we are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024, and beyond. the power of our premium brand continues to grow. and with the very best people in the industry, i couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for delta and our customers. thank you again.

thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. i couldn't be prouder of what the delta people accomplished throughout 2022, and i want to congratulate our teams on their much deserved profit sharing payout they'll be receiving next month. for the full year, we generated revenue of 46 billion, a 19 billion improvement year over year. we delivered record december quarter and full year unit revenues, sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%.
for the 12th consecutive year, delta was named the no. 1 corporate airline in business travel news survey as we continue to invest in our network and product offerings. and through the year, we made significant progress in our long-term commercial strategy to deepen our network advantages, expand premium revenues, grow our loyalty ecosystem, and further diversify our revenues. starting with our network strategy, we focused on solidifying our positions in coastal gateways while protecting our core hub shares.
we secured the leading positions in both boston and los angeles while increasing local market share in our core hubs. premium led all year with paid load factors higher than 2019 and yield growth, outpacing main cabin, while basic economy made up less than 5% of revenue, half of the 2019 levels. we expanded our delta premium select rollout during the year. customer response has been positive, and the cabin performed better than our initial expectations.
our rollout continues in 2023, and we will have this product on 84% of our international widebody fleet by the summer. our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record skymiles acquisitions in 2022, 42% higher than 2019. as ed noted, we're partnering with leading companies to expand our loyalty ecosystem, increasing the value of our program for customers and deepening customer engagement with delta. with an expanding ecosystem and free, fast wi-fi, we expect continued growth in our loyalty base.
our partnership with american express delivered record results with full year renumeration of 5.5 billion, ahead of our initial target and positioning us to deliver over 6.5 billion in 2023 and over 7 billion in 2024. cargo revenue was a record in 2022, and we expect to grow cargo revenues in '23 as increased capacity offsets the cargo yield environment. with strong execution across our business lines, a record 55% of revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. we're confident in our path to exceed 60% by 2024.
while not without challenges, 2022 was a strong year for delta, and we exited the year with momentum. during the december quarter, we generated revenue of 12.3 billion, 8% higher than 2019 on 9% less capacity. we saw revenue recapture at the end of december that offset the impact of weather disruptions in our system around christmas. fourth quarter unit revenues were 19% higher than 2019, with strength driven by consumer demand throughout the quarter.
corporate travel demand was steady through the quarter, with corporate domestic sales 80% recovered to 2019 levels. we expect march quarter revenue to be up 14% to 17% higher versus 2019. on capacity approaching full restoration, we expect march quarter unit revenues will be up 15% to 17% compared to 2019, including a 2-point impact from higher stage. based on how we're deploying our network, our stage length is expected to be up five points compared to 2019, resulting in a higher restoration on asms seats.
this is a temporary dynamic that is unique to delta among major carriers. stage will begin to normalize relative to 2019 and relative to the industry as we rebuild our core hubs later this year. for 2023, we expect to grow revenue 15% to 20% year over year as we fully restore our network and further diversify our revenue streams. consumer demand remains healthy, with advance booking significantly ahead on both yield and load factor for each month of the march quarter compared to 2019.
and in our recent corporate survey, results were positive, with 96% of respondents expecting to travel as much or more in 1q than 4q, led by financial services. and the new year bookings reflect the survey optimism and are accelerating. international revenue continues to be led by the trans-atlantic. we are seeing robust demand across our expanded footprint in europe and expect the spring and summer to set new record revenues.
latin america is performing very well, led by mexico, the caribbean, and central america, with a recovery in deep south america now accelerating. and we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the latam jv. i'm excited about the opportunities for us in 2023 and beyond. in the pacific, we expected record first quarter profits in both australia and korea, as our multi-year international transformation delivers on anticipated results.
japan is also building momentum, and we expect a very strong summer there. and lastly, with china indicating its reopening, we expect to rebuild capacity in line with demand starting later this year. in closing, we delivered on our key commercial priorities in 2022, supporting a significant improvement in our revenue while strengthening our competitive advantages. we have started the new year with great momentum and are well-positioned to extend our leadership position in the years ahead.
and with that, i'll turn it over to dan to talk about the financials.

great. thank you, glen. in 2022, we made significant progress restoring our financial foundation. we delivered earnings of $3.20 per share with pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, ahead of our plan.
operating margin of 7.8% was driven by three quarters of double-digit margins. we improved profitability and our strong advanced bookings. we generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, enabling continued investment in our people, our fleet, our partners, and technology. after gross capex of $6 billion, we generated $244 million of free cash flow.
we ended the year with liquidity of 9.4 billion and adjusted net debt of 22.3 billion. our adjusted net debt to ebitda was five times, and our after-tax return on invested capital was 8.4%. we finished the year strong, reporting a $1.4 billion operating profit on a margin of 11.6% for the december quarter. our nonfuel costs were 13.4% higher than 2019, in line with guidance excluding a 1-point impact from the severe winter weather in late december.
now, moving to guidance. as ed mentioned, we are including all expected labor rate increases in our guidance metrics, including nonfuel casm. as it relates to our pilots, if they vote to ratify the proposed agreement by march 1st, pay rates would be retroactive to january 1st. this results in a 3-point impact on our nonfuel unit costs for the year and in each of the quarters.
including this in the full year guide we gave last month brings our 2023 nonfuel unit decline to 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. delivering a competitive cost structure is a key financial priority. delta has led the industry in investment in our people and our customers, and this is embedded in our outlook, as is a full reset of regional costs and inflation. as we move through the year, scale and efficiency will drive a decline in 2023 nonfuel casm versus 2022.
while approaching 2019 capacity provides scale benefits, we are still bearing the cost to fully restore our network to the peak summer levels, with a continued emphasis on operational reliability during this ramp-up. we expect to complete our rebuild by the second half, with the majority of our flex fleet reactivated and training levels for our pilots reverting to historical levels. this will allow a significant shift of resources from training to production, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver a fully restored network during the peak summer period, while enabling our operating teams to drive efficiency in the back half of the year. one unique item within the year is the pacing of our core maintenance, as we prepare to step up the network for summer flying with the first half year over year higher than the -- and then lower in the second half of the year.
while these dynamics impact the early part of the year, we expect 1q nonfuel unit cost increase 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. we expect the year-over-year unit cost to progressively improve through 2023 as we complete our rebuild and elevate maintenance activity, while driving efficiency across our operating groups. this cadence is consistent with our full year outlook for nonfuel unit costs to decline 2% to 4% year over year. with our outlook for revenue, we expect the march quarter operating margins to be 4% to 6% and earnings of $0.15 to $0.40 per share.
for the full year, we are readying our outlook for earnings of $5 to $6 per share and operating margins of 10% to 12%, delivering a 2- to 4-point expansion of margins, including over 1-point impact from higher profit sharing. we expect the full year of free cash flow to be more than $2 billion with gross capex of 5.5 billion. in 2023, nonoperating expense is expected to be $470 million higher year over year. this results from noncash pension expense increasing over $550 million year over year due to broad market declines, more than offsetting the reduction in interest expense from repaying debt.
we plan to pay cash for our $2.4 billion in debt maturities while opportunistically reducing debt with excess liquidity. this will bring our leverage to three to 3.5 times target for 2023 and remaining on track for 2024 adjusted debt to ebitdar to be two to three times. returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024 while continuing to reinvest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation. in closing, i want to thank -- add my thanks to the delta team and people for their hard work this year.
we outperformed the first year of our three-year plan, and we entered 2023 on track to generate a significant improvement in both earnings and cash flow. we remain confident in delivering on our 2024 target of $7 earnings per share and generating over $4 billion of free cash flow. with that, i'll turn it over back to julie for our q&a.
