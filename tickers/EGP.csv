marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from james feldman with bank of america. please go ahead.
james feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is elvis, on for jamie. just a quick question. if we can just drill into houston and what makes the sort of your rent collections there stronger relative to the rest of your portfolio?
and then number two, any outlook you can share on supply, demand, rent changes that you're seeing in your submarkets relative to the rest of the markets, that would be helpful?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
elvis, it's marshall. i'll take a start at that. in houston, and probably a couple of three things. one, it's always hard to quantify from outside, but we have a really good experienced team that's worked well together for a long time in houston. i mean we've kidded them, houston has a downturn about every few years. so they've gotten a lot of experience, and so they have done a good job and been very diligent about chasing down tenants, maybe comparing it to some other parts of the country, really probably focusing out west to texas is probably more favorable market in terms of landlord rights when tenants don't pay and things like that. so that ability to lock someone out or really push to kind of on that negotiation probably legitimately helps with our collections in houston. and then the third thing, i think, that sometimes gets lost in the kind of the high-level market overview. but when we shrunk our size, our investment in houston from a little over kind of low 20% down to below 14% and still dropping today, what we sold were our older kind of stand-alone buildings and what we've kept are really the buildings that eastgroup has developed that are in parks.
so the quality of what's left, and this statistic is a couple of years old by now, but remember as we were selling, the average age of what we were selling was in the high 30s, like 38 years is what i remember. and the average age of what we still have was eight years. so it's a fairly it's a new, highly functional, well-located eastgroup developed-type parks of what we've got left. and so i think that attracts credit quality tenants that i think even if they're smaller space, there is one other things that's kind of gotten lost the last few months on us is a general kind of paining of, ok, eastgroup has smaller spaces, that must mean mom-and-pop tenants. and there's a lot of national and public or private, well-capitalized companies that need last mile space. and so you're seeing that in our company collections. and then our houston team has just done a great job and been after it to be over 99% the past five months. all that surprises me how well we've done and fingers crossed, we'll keep after that. in terms of any specific submarkets, it's been pretty broad brush.
the trouble we've seen within our tenants, it's not so much by size of space as to what they're doing. it's markets that concern us a little bit. certainly, there's houston because of the supply, although i think people get lost and how much of that is most of that is big box, not shallow bay. and then the other statistic, which gives us some comfort, of the 18.8 million square feet in houston under construction, it's roughly 50% leased, 49.2% leased per cbre. so most of that space is accounted for. that leaves a little over nine million square feet, but absorption year-to-date has been over six million square feet, even during the pandemic in houston. so hopefully, we'll work our way through that as a market. and then a lot of that, thankfully, the majority of it by far is not shallow bay. i'm trying to think of any specific markets. the tourist markets concern me a little bit just because, like las vegas, we need the strip to be open, tourists to be coming to town. it's not a large market for us, but that certainly helps.
our tenants need the economy to be open. and the same with orlando, for example. tampa has been a very stable, strong market. we've had some great releasing spreads there and things like that. in orlando, we've hung in there, but with and i guess, disney is reopened now, but with disney and universal studios and convention slowing down in orlando, those are the markets we said have been hit a little harder than a dallas or charlotte or some markets that are a little more stable like that austin, for example.
james feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then just one more question either for marshall or brent. what you were thinking when you lowered guidance with 1q release and then obviously increasing guidance now? what did you see from tenants then versus now? is it that the markets have reopened? is it that some of those industries that you thought would not survive are actually thriving? what exactly are you seeing that's different quarter-over-quarter?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take it and then brent jump in, both kind of try to answer. i think as we pulled together, to us, as we've kind of said, this shutdown really started and it was a like a curtain coming down in an instant. that friday, march 13, it felt like things came to just a dramatic shocking stop. and then a month later, as we were pulling together our guidance, one, you're just kind of watching the news, watching the economy. it's and all working remotely as we were pulling this together. we just said that this kind of shutdown, it's going to really impact our tenants, and people aren't leaving their homes. so the ability to backfill space is going to be very difficult. what surprised us or me to the good is just how critical our space is to our tenants, even those that have been in trouble, some of our bad debt, we're still working with those tenants to try to figure out ways they're trying to stay in their space or get bring an investor on board and do things like that. so i've been pleasantly surprised. and then with things shutting down, it has accelerated, as people read e-commerce so much.
so there's more and more companies with social distancing that, that has led to incremental demand as the amazon, as the homebuilding, the e-commerce tenants have really grown pretty rapidly this year and continue that. and we've picked up probably our market share of that. so probably seeing that happen that quickly, surprisingly, you think it makes sense that it's going to happen. i just we probably didn't expect it to happen as fast as it did. and i'm really surprised that our average occupancy for the quarter at 96.6% is the same as last year, and last year was a record year. so if you had asked me in april our odds of our occupancy staying the same, i would have been wrong, but i would have bet you a lot that it was going down. and thankfully, it hung in there. brent, any color or commentary on this?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think that's right on. i mean the reality is in april, but so soon, we just didn't know. and now we have a little bit of data and, like marshall said, very pleased with how everything has held up. and there's still some uncertainty, even maybe toward the end of the year. we've got a few things dialed into guidance to hopefully adjust for that. but yes, i would say, in april, we just were so early into it. you just didn't know and you felt like you needed to do something to adjust for the lack of any with any knowledge of what might happen. so again, we're very pleased with where we are, elvis.
james feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
great. congrats on the quarter guys. thank you.
operator
your next question is from daniel santos with piper sandler. please go ahead.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i guess the first one is, i was wondering if you could give some more color on why you're baking in such conservative guidance for occupancy in the back half of 2020? just given the first half has been better than expected, one would expect that the second half would kind of continue that trend. just some color on that would be helpful.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i hope we hope you're right. i mean we our thoughts and today, thankfully, at least speaking, kind of here at the end of july, maybe one more month into it, which since quarter end, we've hung in there. we thought just is this the economy is reopened, but not exactly reopened. restaurants at 50%. i don't know that things won't get shut down again different places where you've heard of different states, different cities, shutting down bars, shutting down this, that gyms or different things that i think that over time has to stress our the 1,600 tenants has to stress our tenants balance sheets over time.
so i hope you're right. i hope we're being conservative, but we thought we're not out of this yet. and as the month build upon each other, it's got to be a drag on some of our tenants. so as we it's not anything specific. there's not any one market, any two or three tenant specific, any large ones that really drive it. it is just more of i'm not sure or i don't believe we're through the end of this. and over time, more of our tenants have to get almost kind of picked off by a weak economy.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then my second question is on distribution. and how much would you say i appreciate the comment on the incremental demand from e-commerce. but how much would you say that covid has really changed distribution in last-mile in a permanent way versus something just the temporary change between now and when things go back to ""normal?""
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
okay. good question. i mean i think the spike that we read about in terms of how much pick any retailer almost, much less than amazon and things that the what the numbers i have seen, the e-commerce growth in terms of retail sales was in the high teens, and then it jumped up into the low 30s as a percent growth. and that people who are expecting it to moderate back into maybe the 20s. but i don't think things will go back to the way they were or some of the things we've read and then actually seen that this shutdown has demystified e-commerce for a large segment of the population. so i think the way people shop and maybe the way they live, too, which i think will help us over time and some belt markets live and work, i think those trends have started this has all accelerated that. if they were all coming this way, e-commerce with last mile was coming our way, company relocations, people relocating in a fast-growing sunbelt markets was happening, but i think this will add fuel to the fire coming out of this, and it really will accelerate it, almost the other side as you see shopping malls die, i think they were dying, but this is somebody says this is euthanasia for some of them. it's pushed it ahead two or three years.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you. sure, you all.

your next manny korchman with citi. please go ahead.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
good morning. this is katy mcconnell, on for manny. can you discuss the potential impact of the ppp program rolling off for your tenant base and risk to rent collections or increased deferrals that you might be factoring into your estimates for the balance of the year?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. this is brent. obviously, we have had some direct feedback from tenants that had initially put in request and then we got feedback later, hey, we received some ppp money and got caught up. and so certainly, we've seen some tenants benefit from that. it's hard to tell out of our 1,600 to 1,700 customers exactly to what extent that's helped. we did do a cross-reference of our tenant base to the public list of companies that have received ppp money. we used $150,000 sort of as a minimum. so we were looking at people that received 150 or greater and it appears that somewhere around 20% of our tenant base did receive some form of ppp money, which seems to make sense to what we expected. i mean we as marshall mentioned, we have only had 29% of our tenants at some and most of that, 26% of the 29% occurred back in april, requested some relief.
in terms of whether they extend the program, if that would be helpful? i think any time you put money into people's pockets, certainly, that would be beneficial. i think 80-plus percent of our tenants have shown a good resiliency without that. so it's really not a lot we can control in that. certainly, if it's part of the program, we would expect that would be incrementally better. but if they don't, our tenant base have been long time customers of ours, and we'll continue to work with them. but it's hard to tell what impact that might would have, whether it does or doesn't happen.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then maybe following up on houston. for the leases you have expiring there, the cr index, can you talk about your expectation for retention as well as backfill demand there?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. the good news, i think that's kind of given a choppy environment, what we've got rolling between now and year-end is only about 4%. so not a ton. and to date, company level, our retention, i think this uncertainty has led our tenants to renew. usually, you think people were working on growth and we were talking about kicking off new buildings here and there in certain cases. and they've pushed put understandably put those on hold until the economy feels a little more solid. so our tenant retention, as a company, is about is 84% year-to-date. and if you were building your model on eastgroup from scratch, i would tell you 70% is usually our long-term and most everybody else's long-term retention rate. so uncertainty has led to a higher retention rate in houston and in other markets. my guess is we have more rolling in 2021.
as the economy stabilizes, hopefully, i think we'll have probably keep that and work our way through. rents have come down in houston, probably 5% to 10% as a market. the good news is anything that you had that may be two to three years, those that are coming up or expiring are going to be anywhere probably from three to five years. so there's still embedded rent growth there, maybe it's down. and i think with supply and stopping really across the country, for the most part, i think because industrial has held up, supply will probably pick up a little more in the back half of the year. but i think houston, we'll work our way through those. and i would expect probably 70-plus percent retention rate, and probably, it will start. hopefully, things normalize the back half of 2021 and things like that, but nothing alarming to date.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst

our next question is from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is elena on for vikram. congrats on the awesome quarter. just could you provide a little bit more color on your expectations for development starts? i know you said that you're not going to have any future spec development starts, but given your confidence on the outlook, just curious why not push development a little bit more?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question. and probably, as we think about it, almost if you divide the second half of the year and the quarters really into another half, we had no we stopped our spec starts because the economy was so uncertain in the second quarter. we're feeling better about things, although still cautious here in late july, probably will not have any starts in third quarter. and then as we roll into fourth quarter, there are some between third and fourth quarter, there are some pre-lease conversations we're having where we would if we get a lease signed, we would build a tenant we would build a building for that tenant, and we have a number of proposals out. so that's probably the biggest part of the difference of the spec development, which is about $70 million in starts between now and year-end. and probably what we are thinking about a little bit differently, their markets like charlotte, phoenix, northeast dallas, there are several markets where i think if these were normal economic times, we already would have started that next phase, and that's a couple of buildings for that an existing park.
but we've really put those on hold. and probably what's giving us a little pause is really watching our own portfolio but also watching the market. we've said, thankfully, we're 97 plus percent leased. but delivering that next building, you want to make sure your peers are also pretty full, but we really thought construction prices are dropping with this slowdown because of not only has industrial slowed down, but hotels, retail, office, entertainment-type development has really stopped. so we are seeing the benefit of waiting in terms of construction pricing a little bit. and then we also wanted to just see what the vacancy rates in submarket-by-submarket, how those went out or which of our tenants, what vacancy we may get within our own portfolio. but thankfully, we've knocked on wood, seeing much of that today.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and just a follow-up on the market. it looks like from the core market operating statistics that rents were a little bit weaker, at least same-property noi was a little bit weaker in the california market. can you kind of just talk about what was going on there last quarter?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
last quarter, one that was weaker, for example, is san francisco, and there at a good property in hayward, we've got a vacancy there. so it's been it was vacant the entire quarter. and last year, it was full. so it's really a drop in occupancy. the good news is we have an agreement, and we'll see if it comes back signed, but we have an agreement with a prospect and a lease out for review and, hopefully, signature there. and then probably the same thing, just kind of looking through the quarter or year-to-date, fresno, it's not a large property there. it's a park that we've owned in fresno since the late 90s, 400,000 feet, and just a little bit of a pickup in vacancy there.
but the biggest one, and we should get we've got some still really strong releasing spreads as you look at kind of in san francisco, a mid-50 type percent, it will be one of those type spaces when we get it released, it's just and it's taken a little bit longer, i would say that space, the markets. east bay, kind of hayward area toward oakland and san francisco is 2% vacancy, sub-2%. but one of our markets that's been shut down probably a little bit longer being california than, say, georgia or the carolinas. and so it's dragged that vacancy out a little bit longer, and that hit us in second quarter there.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks so much.

your next question is from michael carroll with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and marshall, can you provide some color on your comments that the companies plan on increasing safety stock? i know that's been a conversation that's been going around now for the past couple of quarters. have your tenants indicated that they plan or need to hold more inventory to sustain some of these potential supply chain shocks? i mean have they voiced that directly to you yet?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
it's more certainly, it's more us reading and hearing about it and hearing it at conferences and conversations with brokers than direct, i would say, kind of between. i guess, the tricky part from april to now, we've been in front of our tenants less than typical. you may have phone calls and things, but you're certainly not traveling and walking through spaces where you kind of get a sense for how they're using it. but what we were hearing and then hearing directly, a little bit through tenants and then more through brokers and other people, it's just because people got so short sourcing from china and had less inventory that they're going to need to carry more inventory and probably carry more inventory and as other brokers once said to us anytime when someone hits click to when it gets delivered to your doorstep, it speeds that up. that's where the world is going. and that excites us given our type properties and how close we are to rooftops and typically higher-end, better-educated rooftops, more e-commerce oriented.
so i think coming through that, companies are before it was a logistics center, and they'll still have those on the edge of town in chicago, in south dallas, south atlanta, but now their need to carry more and more inventory near rooftops to get when you go from amazon, we're delivering in two and three days to amazon prime and amazon prime now. so and i think that in itself is leading to more inventory, and we're the thing i did read where i'm trying to think of which company is relocating already, craftsman tools from china to fort worth, which is one of our markets. so they'll manufacture there. so we're some of these long-term trends, you're seeing maybe the i use a broker for its green shoots of that, but i think it's pretty early on, but hopefully, it continues to come our way.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then i guess, how broad-based do you think this will be among tenants? i mean will the larger tenants be the ones mostly driving the higher inventory? or do you think smaller tenants will need to do that, too?
and i guess and if so they do hold more inventory, where are they going to hold it out at? i mean is it going to be in the infill of shallow bay space they you have? or is it going to be more in the outskirts of some of these major cities?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
probably it's probably a little bit both. i mean and i think we early on in this kind of this being the downturn, we saw the national tenants still being the most active ones, kind of our conversations, home depot, lowe's, wayfair, tesla, some of those type names. but in the last 30, 45 days, it's been more local regional tenants. probably, as the economy stays open and gets a little more certain, it's nice to see those local kind of regional tenants start to be active. i think they will all need to keep more inventory or probably think about that. they probably have their inventory in their warehouse, depending on how local regional. i think it's the national companies. and i do think i guess, as we talk about like a lowe's and a home depot, it's so much cheaper for them to keep their inventory with us than it is in a strip center-type property.
the large bulky items that you're not leaving your home with, that's where you would order a washer dryer and it gets delivered from an eastgroup warehouse in atlanta or tampa or miami, and that's cheaper than keeping it. i'm only picking on them because they're florida than, say, a regency center that's somewhere else in florida or something like that. so i think that trend will keep coming our way because our rents are probably 1/3 to 1/4 on a gross basis from what a typical strip center retail rent would be. so i think that's all coming our way, and people will figure out just don't work on their supply chain and chipping away at cost, and that pushes more and more inventory our way. we've seen it as i'm thinking about florida where and it's another group we're having conversations with that nike, they've got space for nike and their different brands with us and because it's cheaper to use us as back of store given all the tourists and the outlet malls in orlando, they run hourly van service back and forth to our buildings, and for nike and hurley and some of their concepts, to continue growing and using our type buildings.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks. sure.

your next question is from bill crow with raymond james. please go ahead.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. congratulations guys. marshall, a couple of topics that seem to surface pretty often. i just wanted to get an update from you. number one, what are your tenants telling you about their ability to source labor?
and number two is just any color on construction costs? we know the growth had been coming down. are we actually seeing material declines in construction?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we've seen that our shell cost come down. good question good morning, bill, i guess, backing up that we've seen our shell cost on buildings cut down $1 or $2 per square foot. so it starts to be a meaningful number. we said while rents have kind of the rent growth is at different times, people have thought nationally that rent growth would be flat for 2020, i'm starting to think it will pick up some in the back half of the year given how strong as we talk to our peers and read their reports and things like that, they think rents will maybe pick up the back half of the year. labor certainly has picked up with and it has to with unemployment. it used to be such a big part of conversations of tenants of where if i come to this location, where am i going to source labor and tight markets and especially tight construction markets, where, in a couple of cases, the general contractor had fenced the site where they were building our buildings so that they could lock the basically would lock the workers in because during breaks the competition would show up and try to hire the workers away.
so that gives you an idea of how tight labor was, and that was going on. i don't know that that's completely stopped, but i would think where unemployment is, the labor what we're hearing is labor is more available, but certainly on construction, but a little bit less sufficient and rightly so because of safety distancing requirements and things like that. so we've kind of continued our development, construction on buildings we have under way, dragged our heels a little bit because prices were coming down, and we think rents will bounce back a little bit. so that's part of that you are trying to time when do you really start developing again. and it's early. and it just depends on how you think the if you can get real nervous about thinking about kids going back to school and things like that about another shutdown. so we're being a little bit cautious about that.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
marshall, on the land development land, any indication that it is the competition for the land is easing a little bit or that more owners are looking to liquidate land in order to maybe pay for other investments given the economic environment?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we good question. we've not seen distress in terms of industrial assets. if anything, it seems like demand may have picked up. on land, however, it does seem like there's a little less there is less competition for land. the prices have been sticky. and part of our thinking has been land has been when we met if we had met at nareit last november, we would have said our long-term concern is, it's awfully hard to find good industrial land sites in fast-growing markets, that it's been so picked over and land gets priced out of range for industrial. so we're trying to tie it up as long as the seller would let us, have our funds go at risk as late as possible, but have been happy and that we've been able and then some of it's been in the press, but to tie up some contiguous land in charlotte, like our steele creek, which has been a very successful development, tie up some land in northeast dallas where we could continue developing a good park there, san antonio.
and so we've really and again, contiguous land as i'm kind of thinking through our portfolio in fort myers, where we're building that what would be the last building in a park, the eighth building and a park, and we're out of land, and they were able to source some adjacent land because once you get that many tenants as we have there, really, the next thing to do, and it makes our development risks, i feel like, so much lower than maybe some of our peers as you're just waiting for one of your existing tenants to raise their hand and say, i need another 30,000, 40,000 square feet. so we'll move you into building nine or 10 and backfill your space at a higher rent. so we're trying to use this opportunity to bolt-on a little bit to some of our existing parks, whether it be charlotte or fort myers or northeast dallas or places like that or you can pick up land here or there because we think coming out of this for the reasons we talked about earlier, whether it's e-commerce or manufacturing or safety stock or just relocation to sunbelt markets out of kind of mass transit markets in the northeast, as those pick up, that land is only going to become more and more near and dear.
so if we can use this downtime to slowly and again, land gets a little scary. we want to add a reasonable amount of land so that you don't get stuck carrying it for too long, but that's how we're thinking about it. and yes and unfortunately, when we talk to the brokers about distressed sales, they'll kind of kid and say, i'll put eastgroup here into the ease because i've got a rolodex of names of people that want to buy distressed industrial right now.

your next to eric frankel with green street advisors. please go ahead.
eric frankel -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. you and thank you for workers my phone issues just an accounting question. can you your bad debt assumptions for the second half of the year, can you express what that is going to be on a cash basis?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
eric, good morning, it's brent. we wouldn't know until it occurs what's been happening through the first two quarters. it's probably been running probably 2.5 to one straight-line versus cash. so, so far, out of the $1.2 million or so for the year-to-date, just over $300,000 of that about $325,000 that has been cash. so the cash component of it will be just like it's been. we would anticipate it being similar to where it would be a smaller percent relative to straight-line. the $2.4 million, we have $1.2 million per quarter, as i mentioned, the lead-in, that's just a general overall bad debt allowance, not specific to tenants. and we really don't have that necessarily broken down. we do some internal things. but it will be, like i say, i would expect whatever we have occur, we certainly hope that proves to be conservative. but whatever it comes to be, i would say it would be two times to three times, probably greater on the straight-line side versus cash.
eric frankel -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i think, marshall, you've kind of expressed this in a couple of different ways, but maybe just to clarify specifically. your leasing this quarter, the average lease term is a little bit shorter than it's been for the last few years. so is that just based on a little bit of uncertainty on tenants as their growth plans have been stalled? so i think you're down to roughly 3.5, 3.8 years or so on leases this quarter. is that a trend you expect to stay? do you think that will go back to where it's been in the last few years?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good catch. it is a little bit down. it's been there before kind of late 2016, late 2017, we've been kind of around that four range. so it's not dramatically down, but a little bit. it wouldn't shock me given the uncertainty for third quarter to stay there. and as the economy gets to sound footing, i think then we go back over the 4s, which is where it's kind of 4.1% to 4.5%, that type of thing. so i think kind of, again, a good catch. i think it's more uncertainty in the market, and we'll do a three-year renewal because we're not sure and just stick where it is. but i would expect, and this is me estimating, that it would normalize, hopefully, by fourth quarter, first quarter next year depending on how covid plays out.
eric frankel -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. final question just related to kind of what you're seeing on the last mile demand. how much of this last mile demand is as you're describing with your nike just like store replenishment versus actual customer delivery or delivery to individual consumers?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
it's mostly customer related. it's usually we're going to ship out of an eastgroup building rather than a retail store. i guess what the phrase i've heard some of our customer uses. we used to have store level inventory and now we've moved to market level inventory. so that's, by and large, most of it. probably, store level storage, where you're at that back of house, there are a few examples of it, but that's more the exception.

hi guys. marshall, you mentioned houston rents are down 5% to 10%. but are you seeing any kind of market rent weakness outside of houston or significant rise in concessions across any of your markets?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
no. good question, craig. and not really. i mean we've seen it probably not on renewals, those have stayed pretty consistent. all of our tenants, just about everybody has a tenant rep broker and where it's typically been in the development pipeline or where there's vacancy, where you'll get it's usually you're about rounding third base on getting a deal done, and they'll ask for a month or two of free rent. so we've seen rent free rent grow up where the rents have been pretty stable, the annual increases have been pretty stable, where there has been a little bit of market movement as tenants realize there's not as many tenants out in the market. so free rent could chip up a little bit rather than two months on a longer term lease, maybe they'll ask for two more or three more and we'll settle somewhere in the middle. but outside of houston, thankfully, rents have been have probably leveled out, but not gone backwards.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
and we've heard from some other companies that maybe there's been a trend to try to push bumps higher. have you guys, pre-covid, were you part of that trend to try to get escalators into that 3.5% range? or have you guys kind of where your ass been on that side of the lease equation?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
probably usually, the bigger the space and the longer the term, the it makes sense. they all negotiate those bonds probably closer to 2%. we'd love to go higher, but we're probably typically have been around that 2.5% to 3%. and if we can go higher than that, we would. and again, i guess that's where we're probably it probably boils down between the two brokers. if everybody has a tenant rep broker and you're on a spreadsheet comparing it versus your peers. so probably heading into this, we were trending higher, but not materially higher, and it's really a case-by-case basis. and if you get to a 10-year lease or a bigger space, these tenants are going to push back pretty hard. and that's going to and they're going to get closer, probably to 2% to 2.5% rather than 3% bumps.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
okay. and then just one last one. i apologize if i missed this, but just looking at kind of the monthly collections here, it looks like there's been a marginal fall off as you get further away from april. i'm just curious, is there anything going on there? or is it what's driving that? and also, i mean your portfolio has been in markets that have [indecipherable] start of this kind of more insulated from the impact of covid versus the northeast markets and maybe more on the west coast. are you seeing an uptick in deferral requests as [technical issues] maybe covid kind of impacted communities a little bit more?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, craig, good morning, i'll answer the second part first. we have not seen an uptick in deferral requests, and it's actually gone the other way. the deferral request, thankfully, sort of knock on wood here, have really trailed off. our guys we have a process where we're getting at least weekly reporting from each asset manager in the field. and for maybe three or four weeks running now, a lot of those updates have basically been no new update, meaning there's been no new requests. and so that has certainly trailed off significantly. the ar, we're very pleased with where the collections are. and you can see we've deferred very little. our collections have remained high. our teams worked hard. there certainly has been, as you mentioned, a minimal decline month-over-month, that is very fluid. july, we've got reported here 95.5% and even since we've put the print on this yesterday, that's now 95.9%.
so each day, all of those numbers literally change. i think the deeper we go into it, obviously, the opportunity for that to have pressure certainly there. but on the whole, it's just been the one sort of group of tenants that originally asked for some assistance that we've had to keep a closer eye on, but the vast majority of our tenants have continued to maintain, hang in there and pay. so it's something to keep an eye on, but it's where we are in those high 90s. it's not we don't have any alarm bells or anything going off at this point for sure.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe just slip one more in. what's your exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and apparel type tenants?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
it's funny. we had good questions about retail a couple of years ago, and we would say it's not that great, but it's actually grown over the last few years. and again, i think with e-commerce, as we between the wayfair, the lowe's, the home depot, i can think of, we have conn's in charlotte, almost there's not much. we've had nordstrom as a tenant for over 20 years in orange county. so it's here and there, but we really don't have we don't have a big jcpenney warehouse or tuesday morning or i'm trying to think of different people that we've got some spots here and there. we've got nike in orlando, but it's in three different locations within a park because it's their different brands. so...
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
nothing about ascena or anything?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes, no. i can't think of anything with ascena brands or some of those since i left glimcher. i don't know...
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
all right, thank you guys.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer

your next to venkat kommineni with mizuho. please go ahead.
venkat kommineni -- mizuho -- analyst
hi, good morning. just wondering if you can comment on some of your movement in houston occupancy during the quarter? when i compare occupancy at the end of 1q, it's not provided in the june one business update and then in q2, it looks like it declined from 98.7% to 97% and then ticked back up to 97.9%. and i guess, two questions around that. was that increase in june driven by the lease signed with agility in houston as they now show up in your top tenant list? and as a follow-up, does that initial occupancy decline in april and may help explain the near 100% collection rate in houston in 2q 2020 as maybe some weaker or more challenged tenants vacated space?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
no. i mean good eye. just with the number of tenants, agility was signed, and it's really more delivery and then taking occupancy of the new building. so that's when they jump to get into our top 10. they took a couple of buildings. it's a global third-party logistics firm up at our world houston park. so that moved them into our top 10. we have had some instances, but it's really i'll complement our san antonio team where we've had some problem tenants where they've been able to negotiate getting those tenants out and backfill. but houston, i think it was just collections and really kind of organic movement of tenants in and out or occupancy. and always, in any market, kind of ebb and flow a little bit, unless it's one of our smaller markets where probably fewer moving parts, but with houston with 5.5 million square feet, there's always someone kind of coming and going almost like an apartment complex, if you could think about that. and agility was really more delivering a new building and then taking occupancy of that building is what moved them in.

marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, and thanks for calling in for our second quarter 2020 conference call. as always, we appreciate your interest. brent wood, our cfo, is also participating on the call. and since we'll make forward-looking statements, we ask that you listen to the following disclaimer.
keena frazier -- director leasing statistics

marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, keena. good morning, and thank you for your time. we hope everyone and their families remain well and out of harm's way. i'll start by thanking our team. they've done a great job transitioning our operating strategy quickly and doing so while working remotely. our second quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market. the team had a solid quarter, producing such stats as funds from operations came in above guidance, up 9% compared to second quarter last year. this marks 29 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend. and for the year, ffo per share is up 9.5%. our quarterly occupancy was high, averaging 96.6%, leaving us 97.5% leased and 97% occupied at quarter end, ahead of our projections. our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e-commerce and last-mile delivery trends, also benefiting our occupancy as a high year-to-date retention rate of 84%. re-leasing spreads were strong for the quarter at 13.8% gaap and 7.9% cash. year-to-date leasing spreads are higher at 20.1% gaap and 11.5% cash.
finally, same-store noi was up 4.1% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. in sum, during an extremely choppy environment, i'm proud of our team's results. our strategy remains one of maintaining occupancy and cash flow with an eye on liquidity. i'm hopeful our strategy will shift again later in 2020 to focus on growth. in terms of liquidity, i'll thank brent and our finance team as at quarter end, we had the highest availability on our line in the company's history and one of the lowest percentages drawn on our line in decades. brent will give you color or commentary about our upcoming debt placement, further improves our liquidity while lowering our cost of capital. i'm grateful we ended the quarter generally full at 97.5% leased, while houston, our largest market at 13.8% of rents, is 97.9% leased, has roughly a 4% square footage roll through year-end and a five-month average collection rate on rents of over 99%. my five months used being the length of this pandemic to date. company level rent collections remain resilient. for july thus far, we've collected 95% of rents.
the unknown is when the economy truly reopens, how fast it will reopen, in which cities and are there any shutdowns remaining. we and everyone else simply have less clarity than normal even several months into this. brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that with our second quarter results and a realistic plan, we can reach $5.28 per share in ffo. we are only $0.02 shy of our original pre-pandemic expectations. towards that end, we thankfully also have the most diversified rent roll in our sector, with our top 10 tenants only accounting for 7.5% of rents, down almost 200 basis points over the past few years. as we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand. with the shutdown, we reduced projected 2020 starts to reflect first quarter actual starts as well as some level of pre-lease conversations under way.
in other words, we're not forecasting new spec developments at this time. we're also looking at acquisitions and value-add investments in the same light. given the positive long-term distribution trends we foresee, we're working on several land sites which we view as valuable development parcels when the economy stabilizes. and in the meantime, we view operations, working with our tenants and maximizing liquidity as the key goals until we reach the next market phase.
and now brent will review a variety of financial topics, including our updated 2020 guidance.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning. our second quarter results reflect the resiliency of our team and strong overall performance of our portfolio amid unprecedented conditions. ffo per share for the second quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.33 per share and, compared to second quarter 2019 of $1.22, represented an increase of 9%. the outperformance was primarily driven by our operating portfolio, maintaining occupancy and collections better than we had estimated in april, which was the initial onset of the pandemic. i will center my comments around our capital status, rent collections and deferment requests and assumption changes that increased the midpoint of our ffo per share estimate.
during the second quarter, we raised $30 million of equity at an average price of $123 per share. and earlier this month, we agreed to terms on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $175 million. the $100 million note has a 10-year term with a fixed interest rate of 2.61%. the second note is $75 million on a 12-year term with a fixed interest rate of 2.71%. we anticipate closing on both notes in october. that activity, combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet, has kept us in a position of financial strength, which is serving us well during this time of uncertainty. our debt-to-total market capitalization is 21%, debt-to-ebitda ratio is 5.1 times, and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratios are over 7.2 times. our rent collections have been equally strong. we have collected 98.1% of our second quarter revenue and entered into deferral agreements for an additional 0.8%, bringing our total collected and deferred to 99% for the second quarter.
as for july, we have collected 95.5% of rents thus far and have entered into deferral agreements on an additional 0.7%, bringing the total of collected and deferred for the month to 96.2%. that is slightly ahead of june's pace. last april, we reported that 26% of our tenants have requested some form of rent deferment. in the three subsequent months, that has only risen to 29%. we have denied 79% of the request, are in various stages of consideration on 8% and have entered into some form of deferral agreement with 13% of the request. the rent deferred this far totals $1.5 million, which only represents approximately 0.4% of our estimated 2020 revenues. as we stated last quarter, the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy is undeterminable. however, the menacy and degree of potential tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy we had budgeted for in april did not occur in the second quarter. as a result, our actual performance and revised assumptions for the remainder of the year increased our ffo earnings guidance by 2.1% from a midpoint of $5.17 per share to $5.28 per share or a 6% increase over 2019.
among the changes were an increase in average occupancy from 95.2% to 96% and a decrease in reserves for uncollectible rent from $3.8 million to $3.6 million. note that the reserve for potential bad debt for the third and fourth quarter of $2.4 million is not attributable to specific tenants. rather, it is a general assumption that there will be some companies who succumb to the disruption in the economy caused by the pandemic. other notable revisions include a lower average interest rate on new debt and the increase of equity issuances by $95 million. in summary, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. we will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team and the quality of our portfolio to navigate us through the remainder of the year.
now marshall will make some final comments.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brent. in closing, i'm proud of our second quarter results. we said the past few years, our fear wasn't shallow bay oversupply as much as a black swan economic event. we don't want either, but now we have just that. our company and our team have worked through these before and while different, we're working through this one, too. as the economy stabilizes, it's the future that makes me the most excited for eastgroup. our strategy, which has worked well the past few years, will come out of this pandemic with trends that we're hearing of, including companies carrying additional safety stock inventory, shopping habits that have changed accelerating the consumer to e-commerce, new industrial users as a result of these shopping habits and increased u.s. manufacturing or nearshoring in mexico. meanwhile, our bread and butter traditional tenants will remain and continue needing last-mile distribution space in fast-growing sunbelt markets. all of these, along with the combination of our team, our markets and our properties, have me optimistic about our future.
we'll now open up for any of your questions.

[operator instructions] and we will take our first question today from james feldman with bank of america securities. your line is open.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america securities -- analyst
good morning. this is elvis rodriguez on for jamie. great quarter, guys. just a couple of questions. so, houston occupancy and lease percentage declined 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. are there -- were those -- was that expected? or any specific leases you can discuss?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. elvis,. good morning. elvis, it's marshall. in houston, maybe a little bit of an update. i would say, expected, although -- and not houston specific. we really had thought our occupancy is kind of, as we thought the last couple of quarters, would dip more than it has, so expected move-outs, kind of some moving parts. i think of our bad debt, they're -- oddly enough, there's really not been oil and gas. we did have one trouble tenant. it's in the airline industry. so it's really more specific than houston, just with the slowdown in airlines. they refurbish interiors and things like that. so that was one blip in houston and probably overall expected, although not any specific tenants. since, i guess, the end of the quarter, we've regained 50 of those basis points. so houston is back to 96.7%, which thankfully, it's not at our portfolio average, but it kind of rounded just under 97% leased. we're comfortable with houston.
and then, we've also been pleasantly surprised kind of through the pandemic to be at 99% rent collected, but houston has been better than our company average at around 99.5% collected, kind of going back to march, really when this started. so we think houston -- it's probably steady as our team there described it. and that's probably a good answer. it's not our best market. supply has thankfully slowed down, as you'd imagine, most people have stopped. there's a lot of -- most of what is being built or newly delivered is more big box, so not directly applicable. and we'll be fine in houston. i think the street -- and i guess it's all expectations. the street has been much more worried about houston than the reality has been today. and we think we'll be kind of at 95% to 97% leased, depending how a couple of things play out between now and year-end.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just one follow-up. so your development starts, i know you said you're going to continue or increase developments going forward, but it went from one million square feet to 825 million square feet of starts for the year. and i know you mentioned some delays from covid, but maybe can you give us an outlook on what you're thinking for '21 and supply versus demand in your markets for next year?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. sure. good question. we had -- really, as this started, like most of our peers kind of said, let's finish what's in our pipeline, but not start anything new, just to see how this plays out. and thankfully, today, it's been -- you're kind of waiting for the bad news, but it's been much less than anticipated, certainly in march, and then again, maybe when we reported in july, for example. and happy, our 97.8% leased at quarter end, and we're about there today. so really, october, i'd say, looks a lot like third quarter, it is, was our second highest quarter on record. so with that -- and i'll credit some of our brokers saying, we've got some internal tenants that are looking for expansion space. and people out in the market, you really -- can i have -- you really need to give me some inventory to work from. so we'll start -- and charlotte, phoenix, or other space, a couple of markets in northeast, dallas, fort worth, some of those orlando that we see the opportunity to start delivering.
we're still working on our 2021 budget, but i would say if things not necessarily improved, but just don't deteriorate, reading the same headlines on number of covid cases, if things don't shut down again, our -- the difference this quarter is really more about timing, and when we get things started, and permitting, and construction crews mobilized. but we feel pretty good about -- at this pace about our '21 starts and that they'll be more like a typical year of starts. if we can hang in there at 97-plus percent leased and starting to see demand either from new tenants. and i think our tenants are getting comfortable enough. everybody's maybe getting their sea legs through this to expansion plans that they put on hold to start talking about new space and things like that. so i think '21 without getting too specific will be a -- i'm expecting it to be, hopefully, a good year of starts for us.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thanks, marshall and congrats again on the quarter.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer

we will take our next question today from daniel santos with piper sandler. your line is open.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking my question. congratulations also on the quarter. just continuing with the development theme, i was wondering if you could walk us through just what you're seeing as far as development costs and yields at cost at different markets. that would be helpful.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, dan. the good news, what's been interesting to us kind of on a macro level, and as i said, we're just getting some of the construction bids finalized and think then i'll use charlotte, which is probably the furthest along a couple of others are build and shell costs have come down. land prices have been fairly sticky. we've acquired some land. you saw fort myers and some other land that we have under contract and things kind of predominantly adjacent to or around the corner from parks to kind of keep working on that next phase of a park. land prices have been sticky, but shell costs have come down, maybe not dramatically, but a couple of bucks a foot, maybe 5% to 7%. our yields have thankfully hung in there on our product type. most of our peers are the bigger box, maybe a little more on the edge of town, where we're typically a business park, infill, last mile location.
so i'm pleased to see our yields hanging in there. that 7% to even 7.3%, i think looking back at our supplement between what we're developing and delivering. and the trend we've really seen in the last 90 days is a drop-off in cap rates with what we've been told is -- makes sense, lower interest rate cost and then just the fear of other asset classes, be it office or retail or hotel that there's been a lot of capital flowing toward industrial. so our development profits have really gone up. if we can maintain our yields and maybe our rents are about the same, our cost is coming down slightly. so our yields have been able to hang in there, but we think the value, when we finish, the value creation has increased probably 25 basis points or so or more in the last 90 days.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then second, i mean, based on your rent collections and your occupancy, it's safe to say, your portfolio has been fairly well insulated from covid impact. but in places of the markets where there has been at least a spike, could you walk us through maybe some changes in economic activity or tenant behavior that you're seeing in those markets?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
nothing recent so much. i mean, maybe one market that probably kind of comes to mind for me. if you look to florida, it is a good market. but talking to our team there and what's interesting maybe using -- occupancy is fine in south florida, but looking at our gateway project, that's right next to hard rock stadium. we built two buildings. they leased up before we completed them, lowe's, peloton, best buy. it fits really, i guess, using those as kind of as a last-mile delivery part. but then we delivered the third building, and it's been -- will be fine, but it's been slower to lease up. and talking to the team there, miami has been more shut down economically than, say, tampa, jacksonville, fort myers, orlando, the other markets we're in, in florida. so i think that's where we've seen it. las vegas is another market where we acquired three new buildings, two of them leased up before we can finish. and the third one, we've got activity on both of those, but it's taken a little bit longer to lease. and it's really more about the local economy being shut down in the last few months. because all of a sudden, what we have done, i would have guessed in miami, our third building would have leased up, usually easier than your first building in a brand-new park, but it's been a little bit harder. and i think that's really because of covid and really the market being closed for the most part.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you and we will go next to emmanuel korchman with citi. your line is open.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
hi, this is chris mccurry in for manny. quick question from us. what are you seeing in the transaction markets now that is giving you confidence in raising guidance for these volumes? and how do you think pricing has changed since pre-covid levels?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i'm trying to -- good question, make sure i'm understanding it. the pricing, in terms of finished products, probably 25 to 40 basis points lower, certainly lower in the major markets. and then what we've seen of late, even if they're still top 20 markets, but maybe not the top handful being -- we chased a portfolio in atlanta. that will be in the low fours, are talking to cbre. at one point, they had three projects under contract that we're waiting to close that were all below the lowest cap rate in atlanta, for example. they were all kind of in that 4.25% to 4.5% range. austin, we're seeing 4.5% type cap rates, which we have and prices per square foot nearing $200 a foot in places like austin. so we were -- just as we were kind of getting used to seeing it in l.a. and san francisco and miami, now we're seeing that spread. charlotte has a portfolio in the market. and i'm trying to not violate confidentiality agreements and things like that, but we'll go at a low cap rate for charlotte, probably a record there. so those kind of markets where do you want to call it in number six through 25, we're seeing cap rates down. and again, i think that's -- what we're told is people are comfortable with industrial rent growth going forward and just lack of appeal of maybe some other asset classes outside of multifamily and industrial right now being the two that are the most in favor.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
yes. i think, too, then you may be referencing to our increase in our value-add property acquisitions from none to $30 million, and marshall might touch on those. those are a couple of deals that we had planned to close last year and they've leased a little quicker. and so, i mean, those are both under contract and going to close before the end of the year. so those are deals in hand.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i guess a little more color. we'll -- i'll probably won't get too far ahead. but one of our acquisitions, it really was a value-add and i'll credit john coleman and his team in the eastern region were able to get a tenant in hand before the building was finished. so what was going to be a value add, and thankfully was priced like a value-add will now roll in as an acquisition. and then the other one brent references, which we have announced, is the rancho distribution center, the one in rancho cucamonga. we bought it. it's an owner user leasing the building back for about half a year basically. and we think because of that leasing, certainly, it's very close between two freeways and near the ontario, california airport, if that felt you. we think we're getting a better pricing by taking that leasing risk on. so again, it's -- and i guess it helps in terms of our confidence talking with the brokers in southern california. they describe their market almost like a goalpost, and that things were great. first quarter, they really stopped. second quarter and since, it's been a big pickup in business and a lot of activity in that inland empire, especially inland empire west, where this property is.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
got it. yes. that's helpful color. just a quick follow-up. how do you think about using asset sales versus equity issuance as a source of funds?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i mean, we're very pleased with the attractiveness of our stock price, and you see we issued some debt this quarter. and we were very pleased that the markets were not only open and available to us, but very attractive. so we're not short of capital. i mean, those will be our primary sources of capital. but i think as we've been for several years now that recycling, being good stewards of recycling, through some of our lesser assets, i think it's more of that more so than doing it for capital, per se. so i think you'll see us continue to chip away at houston. we're very pleased to get that down into the 13% area and continuing to decline. we've got a property there that we anticipate closing before year-end. but it's more just navigating that aspect rather than capital. we have -- thankfully, we're in a position where our bottlenecks, more opportunities, and opportunities that we like versus capital access, which is a good problem to have.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
got them. thank you.
operator
and we will go next to eric frankel from green street. your line is open.
eric frankel -- green street -- analyst
thank you. i was hoping if you can give us a little more color on how market rents are generally trending. so just looking at your rental changes by market, it looks like a few markets, understandably california, but even parts of texas can be doing really well, while other markets have decelerated a little bit. maybe you could provide a little more color.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure, eric. good morning. it's marshall. kind of you're right. the california markets are still strong, and that helped our releasing spreads this quarter, which we were happy to oddly, an upset a record during the pandemic. it's kind of one of those where you -- it builds counterintuitive where the headlines aren't matching what we're seeing day-to-day. so the california markets, maybe fresno is a little slower, certainly than the bay area, l.a., san diego. probably our bigger markets, houston, has kind of flattened out. it's steady. as you'll see, at least year-to-date, i'll say any quarter, pending the batch of leases we have, you can get some anomalies or in some of our smaller markets, like atlanta, have a negative number, but it's really more about which leases have rolled. and we don't have a big enough base there yet to really get a good statistical measure. so houston is a little bit slower. their rents have gone backwards earlier in the year, improving now a little bit with activity picking up in houston.
the rest of them probably were staying and starting to pick back up again. i think with the stop in construction and especially looking at the charts, construction is starting to pick back up. but if you really dig through it kind of one more layer into the onion, the construction that's starting back up is predominantly big box. and that's why we're a little -- we are excited about starting our development pipeline back up where we don't have the activity. by the time we deliver, it will be probably, call it, second quarter of '21, and we typically underwrite a year to lease it back up. so we think we're going to be ahead of the market with some of our deliveries. and that not many people are not keeping it very private, but not many people are looking at developing shallow bay right now.
eric frankel -- green street -- analyst
right. it makes sense. one of your peers kind of mentioned earlier this earnings season that leasing volume might slow up a little bit next year just as the economy opens up and maybe folks change their consuming habits and spend a little bit less on amazon.com and more on vacations or concerts or whatever services. do you have any views on what the economic recovery would look like and how that might shape demand?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i guess i'll preface it by saying we're not economists. as you look as we've beaten our guidance a couple of times, we -- brent and i clearly aren't good economists, have anything with that. that preface i think -- i'd like to think with the -- we'll get questions. do you think amazon is creating a false sense of demand in the market? and i would say that's certainly not true, although we aren't having a number of conversations, not true in the shallow bay space. i can only speak with where we're dealing. and one broker described it more of a disruptor. and then i think other companies will really have to adapt to amazon's model and more and more to e-commerce and delivery rather than in stores. so the other thing, i do think e-commerce won't grow at the rate. it's -- not at 80% rates, like it's growing currently. but i also think with each quarter that goes by, even in this kind of abnormal economy, tenants or i described our own team as we're kind of getting our sea legs. first quarter was normal. second quarter was a huge disruption. i think our own tenants are getting used to it or there's a couple of cases where we've had tenants speak to us saying they almost run out of inventory at different times. and what we read about first was safety stock.
now we're starting to see it a little more and more, i think the other industry that will benefit eastgroup, we've typically -- and we've got the ferguson plumbings, and the delta, kohler homebuilding picking up. i think that's the other thing. home renovation and homebuilding we're seeing some activity within our portfolio, but i think we'll see more of that as the homebuilders really seem to be ramping up and doing well and population shifts. so i'm more optimistic about '21 than i was '20. i'm grateful that our team and we've been able to hang in here better than we thought, but i'm more optimistic about '21. assuming there's not -- i guess my danger, i'm assuming there's not another huge curveball we all get on.
eric frankel -- green street -- analyst
that's it. thanks for taking my questions.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, eric.

and we will go next to craig mailman with keybanc capital. your line is open.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hey, guys. maybe i just want to circle back to the balance sheet and maybe from a higher level. clearly, your cost of equity has made it very conducive to use the atm to help fund, but the cost of debt is also extremely low for you guys now. but just in the context of lower cap rates for industrial assets, by nature, raise debt to ebitda, just the way the math works. and just kind of curious, as you guys think about the optimal capital structure to maximize earnings, kind of minimize risk, what are talks internally? kind of how do you guys balance those two things? and does there need to be some upward trend in debt-to-ebitda just to be able to kind of maximize everything?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, craig, it's a conversation we have frequently. and thankfully, it's been from the views of two positives. as i mentioned earlier, it's been an attractive cost of equity and also, as you mentioned, an equally attractive cost of debt. we merit on the side this year being, i guess, you would call it a bit conservative as we put in the release. we actually, as of today, it will change fairly quickly, but we're not even carrying a balance on our revolver. our almost $400 million revolver, which is the first time i can recall, not being drawn in my years with the company. so it's an ongoing discussion. there's times where we feel like maybe we should be a little more levered, and then you have situations that we had earlier in the year and your price goes to -- i don't know, we want to $88 or $90 a share. and then all of a sudden, you feel better about being as conservative as you are. so it ebbs and flows with where things are, but i would point out, our debt-to-ebitda has trended down over time. although, as you mentioned, craig, it's a bit of a challenge when you're growing, especially as we do via development where you're perennially drawn on development costs that aren't yet producing noi that makes that a bit more of a challenge.
but we did go sub 5% this past quarter debt to ebitda, which, overall, for us would be a goal, but it's not a goal to the extent where we would -- wouldn't preclude us from continuing to develop -- ramp up development. if that means debt-to-ebitda goes up just a little bit, that's just inherent with the way that works. so that -- we're in a good spot. so the balance sheet, like i say, it's in good shape, just really more of our time and energy and focus is how do we find those opportunities. our guys with the boots on the ground do a terrific job looking under rocks and trying to find the things that work for us. so really, the focus continue to be there.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
if i -- i agree with brent, craig. i guess i would add. maybe if we went back a couple, three years ago when our debt to market cap was more in the mid-30s and our debt-to-ebitda was a little bit higher ratios and things like that. typically, we have targeted 150 basis point spread over market cap rates. and really, the last couple of years, or today, we're probably more around 300 basis points. meaning if we can build to a seven two, it's probably about a four two count. so as we've talked about our strategy and kind of how do we position ourselves, you're tempted. you don't want to push too much product into the market. you want to see it getting absorbed as we keep kind of reloading the inventory for development. but with the value creation there, it's so attractive, kind of the offset to that, kind of waiting for some disruption. we said, let's have a -- if we're going to be a little bit operationally aggressive to take advantage of the environment, let's be balance sheet safe.
so that's when we really started. and thankfully, the market gave us the opportunity to pull our balance sheet down to where it is today. i don't feel the need to really continue to de-lever. we might if the opportunity presents itself, but we think we can be comfortable stepping on the gas where the market is really asking for those development opportunities. and we love the spreads we're seeing there. they are as wide as they've ever been in our company history, but it also helps to have a safe balance sheet behind that in case something takes a little bit longer to lease-up or several of them do.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate the thoughts there. and then just, brent, relative to the same-store guidance, you guys are at 3.6% year-to-date. midpoint is 3%. is this just conservatism? or it's late in the year, so it's harder to move the numbers. but i mean, does this imply sort of a decel from 3q levels in 4q to get to that midpoint? or should we think more you guys could be at the higher end of that 2.5% to 3.5% range?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
as we traditionally do, the information we put in that guidance table is just transparency on what equates to that midpoint of ffo. so in that case, it does dial up to that 3%. and as you basically are backing into, that does imply a bit slower fourth quarter than the earlier quarters. and as of right now, from a budget perspective, that is what we've got dialed in now as to what happens there. each quarter here through the year, we have been ahead of where we've anticipated. so my hope would be that, that proves to err a little bit on the conservative side and improves yet again. but just a reminder, last year, third and fourth quarter were some of our, i think, the highest percentage lease marks we've had in the history of the company. so i don't know so much of the deceleration in markets as much as the measuring stick that you're going up against there is pretty darn strong. and you compare that to just, again, budget assumptions aren't our goal or is an objective every day, so you hope you'd beat that. but -- so we'll see. like i say, it's just a quarter to go there, and we're only two months to go there. so we like where we are at this point in the fourth quarter, and our focus would pretty quickly here turn to kind of see how that stacks up for next year.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
right. and then if i could slip one more in. marshall, the rancho cucamonga deal, is that the $28 million, i.e., west deal that you guys did in the quarter?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
you're correct. yes.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
can you just talk about what kind of initial yield is versus what it could be stabilized when the tenant in place kind of moves out and you guys either put capital in or roll the rent up or down?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the risk -- the owner leased the building back, so the rents are probably at market today, and i would call that mid- to higher fours. i think if we -- and it's not like we're not going to flip the asset. but if we put a, call it, not a fortune 1000, five to seven-year tenant, and it were unit and brent, we could probably sell it in the higher threes today in terms of market -- where market cap rates are. so i think we'll stabilize. i think as we underwrote it, we'll maintain that yield. i'm a little bit optimistic by the time the tenant moves out, given what's going on in inland empire west and how land constrained that area is that our rents that we underwrote being, call it, 60 days ago, are going to be below market six months from now. so -- but that said, i think we'll end up a little bit below 5%. we'll end up below 5%. hopefully, we get any of the tenant, the term, call it, four and three quarters, something like that. so i think we're getting a good 75-plus basis point premium to where market cap rate would be today.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
nice job. i appreciate it. thanks.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
no, and i like to add maybe a little color, too like -- and none of them are material and a couple of them we have still to close. but if it telegraphs kind of our thinking, we like strategically to grow in southern california, trying to find an opportunity to be patient, which has been awfully hard to do in la. and i like that we're lining things up, and fingers crossed to exit santa barbara, and sell our last r&d building there and then close on another asset in houston. so we're down 30 basis points in terms of what houston is in our portfolio this from second quarter. and then we'll sell something in fourth quarter, hopefully, and just kind of keep turning the dials in the right direction, has been our description. so that helps, at least in terms of kind of how we're thinking of portfolio allocation. they're not big moves, but they're all maybe baby steps in the right direction on all three of them.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
absolutely. thanks a lot.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yup.
operator
we will go next to bill crow with raymond james. your line is open.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. marshall, you've referenced a couple of times today the inflow of capital into the sector from other places. and i guess that leads to kind of a three-part question. are you seeing new competitors on acquisitions? is there an erosion in development discipline, which might be evidenced in extended lease-up periods and new construction? and three, how do you think this thing ends?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
and if i can remember all. good morning, and i hope i can remember all three of those. yes, we are seeing, which surprised me during a pandemic, but we are seeing new entrants into industrial, probably more, and it makes sense more on the acquisition and development side, although we see both. some new entrants to development in dallas and things like that. we're not seeing an oversupply, doesn't mean we won't, but to date, we haven't seen that much development. and typically, like in the case, and i'm trying to remember the specific projects in dallas, they were more edge of town big boss. you can put more dollars to work. if you're coming into the market, and i've gotten calls where i would call it working acquaintances over the time of your career that aren't in industrial, really to talk about industrial and how do we think about it and view it and things like that. so it does make you nervous about where things are. it's like your uber driver giving you softails. so i think it does get you nervous. so we tell them it's a horrible sector. stay out of it. it's oversupply, things like that. but we're not seeing oversupply. we are seeing new entrants. and i am an optimist in that where i think, in terms of where it ends, what surprised us back in 20 -- kind of late 2015, 2016, because everything is so institutionally held, unlike the old days where it was -- the three of us, looking at brent too, and a bank loan, development shut down rapidly in houston in late 2015, when oil and gas turned down.
and this time, although the industrial fundamentals have held up and you wouldn't -- as one board member said to me, i wouldn't know there was a pandemic, if i didn't -- just reading through the numbers. but i do think that our industry is much more disciplined and much more institutionally owned. so i think things still have the ability to shut down like they did in texas in 2016, and like they did earlier this year. so i think it ends well. i'm an optimist. the other thing we're seeing is kind of where amazon is leading so many retailers and new uses of, i think, the growth rate for e-commerce and how the american public shops, whether it's curbside pickup or delivery or online is just beginning. and we'll see a lot of growth from that. and that's where i look at -- sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, but our shallow bay infill locations have always worked. and i think we'll pick up over -- it will take years, but the next year to five years, a lot of new type customers in our buildings. we're starting to see that and seeing more and more repeat business from customers in our portfolio because of that.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thank you for your time.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. bill.
operator
and we will move next to michael carroll from rbc capital markets. your line is open.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i wanted to talk a little bit about your guidance occupancy trend. obviously, it's held up fairly well over the past three quarters better than, i guess, expectations. i guess, what's driving that? is it that due to the strong leasing volumes that you guys have been able to deliver over the past few quarters? is it just less tenant issues that you thought possibly could have happened? or is it a little bit of both?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take this out and brent jump in. i think maybe to -- certainly the last tenant trouble, i guess at the start of this, we -- looking back, i'll say i felt comfortable about each group, given where our balance sheet was, but with 1,600 tenants, i was worried that we all won't make it to the other side of this march, which tenants get kind of taken out by the downturn and the economic really shutdown. and that attrition has been much less than we would have anticipated. so that's helped our occupancy. and then the other thing, i think, with the uncertainty, we typically historically average our retention rates in the low 70% to 75%, is probably high and over time. and year-to-date, i believe it's at 83%. so i think with uncertainty, tenants have put growth plans -- growth plans that they had in late '19, early 2020 has been put on hold. so we've been able to keep a number of our tenants. there were tenants we had earlier in the year where we had a budgeted vacate, where they said, i'm just going to do -- our leasing turn has been consistent a little north of four years where it always is.
but well, they just done renewals rather than move out because they were uncertain of what was going to happen. so i think those have been the two big drivers to me. and then the team as markets reopened, and thankfully, our -- i won't -- not speaking medically, but just in terms of business economics, thankfully, the majority of our markets opened up earlier than the rest of the country, whether it's atlanta, the carolina, texas, florida, and that's where we've really seen that activity. and some of the guys say it's -- we're back to pre-covid levels in terms of leasing velocity these days.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then if you're looking at your -- i guess, your tenant roster, i mean, have you done an exercise of how many tenants are in sectors that are overly exposed that are like in leisure or event planning that might have to get back space that could cause some near-term disruptions? or is it so modest for you that you don't really see too much risk on that front?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we certainly look at those sectors. i mean, maybe two things. i'm glad at -- and ours has moved around a little bit. our top 10 tenants are about just north of 8% of our revenues. and that's by far the lowest we've seen within the industrial sector. so i -- we like geographic diversity, and we're working on that, and i like landfall diversity. we certainly have those tenants on our watch list and you worry about orlando and las vegas. those markets have been, again, internally, surprisingly sticky, where we hung on to our tenants and had fewer issues than we would have guessed a handful of months or so ago. i think we watched those, but they hung in there. and then thankfully, our rent relief request really came in, in april. and since then, tenants move around, and we do see those, but our rents are coming in earlier and each of the last three months have improved. we were waiting when the ppp ones kind of ran out, what happens next month in collections.
and thankfully, the last three months, september was better than august, october has been coming in earlier than september. so it feels like it's improving. so our rent relief request, not -- they haven't gone away, but they've gone down materially. and surprisingly, at this point, 50 basis points of our revenue, and we've collected a fair amount of them, were rent that got deferred earlier. we have collected a fair amount of that rent. so it makes us feel better about the portfolio and able to really raise guidance last quarter and again this quarter, ok, we're -- again, you're kind of waiting for that bad news as these things played out. and, knock on wood, it hasn't been as harsh on -- i'm sorry, any of the industrial reits, as we expect, probably all expected back when.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. i guess, last question, and i'll jump off is, i guess, you did talk a little bit about your watch list. i mean, how big is that watch list right now? and how did it compare, i guess, what, three, six months ago?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
probably, it's less than three or six months ago. i mean it's more not by market or even -- it's really tenants like the -- like i mentioned the one in houston, where you're doing airplane refurbishments and your whole industry gets hit or we had someone that was in the dental supply business in atlanta. and when this hit, people stopped going to the dentist for a bit. so those were the tenants that got pulled under. i think with 1,600 tenants, even in a good economy, we have tenants on our watch list, but it's thankfully right now, probably no longer than normal.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, i would agree. it's -- our bad debt continues to come in less than we had originally anticipated. and the watch list and receivable ledger really has maintained, been pretty clear. so we continue to be impressed with collections, and extremely impressed with our houston collections. and our team there, kevin and his team, have done a terrific job, as marshall mentioned. for third quarter between collections and rent deferral, we collected 100% of our rents there in houston for third quarter, which is just a testament to the team there and our tenant base. but -- so the watch list, all things considered, is very manageable.
operator
we'll go next to ki bin kim with truist securities. your line is open.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. when you look into your tenant rolls for the next 12 months or so, any pockets of concern that we should be aware of? and also, how do you think about your mattress firm tenant today?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. there's always movement within our tenants. it's more about spaces. i can think of one where we know the tenant has multiple locations and consolidating so we'll get that space back. but thankfully, there's one in l.a. there's upside on the rents that they're paying today, and we'll refurbish the building and get that leased. so nobody major that jumps up. again, i would expect our retention rate as the economy stabilizes to drop back from the low 80s more into the lower 70s where we traditionally are. but hopefully, there's more prospects out there. and in some cases, we're looking at upgrading tenancy and kind of weeding out. again, i'm happy we've had 99% collection through the pandemic. so i can't -- it's not really fair for me to complain about some of our tenants. but here and there, you do get a chance to upgrade the use and tenancy. and mattress firm is -- they've been through everything i guess, their bankruptcy and through this. their lease is we probably are winding through a number of the mattress firm leases in the next couple of years. i'm trying to do it from memory, going through the bankruptcy.
but the good news at the time they're in multiple locations. the average building age, i want to say, when they had their bankruptcy, maybe 18 months ago, was about six years on those buildings. so they're in some new developments in places like houston and fort myers and tampa, so some markets where there's enough velocity in moving tenants. so they're -- i think they're in a tough industry, but they're current today. and they're certainly ones you watch just because the industry demand. and we're probably closer to the end on some of those leases than we are at the beginning. so we'll take a look at those spaces and really learn what their plans are, too, i guess.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and do you have any early estimates for prop 15 and what that can do to your tax base in california?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, i think really, virtually all of our california leases are triple net. so they won't get past through to our tenants, at least what we -- the latest i've read that people did not expect it to pass, but i think who knows on that. and that it would take a couple of years for the tax assessors -- two to three years to really get through and reassess buildings there. thankfully, for us, it will -- i won't say 100%, but well in the mid- to high 90s, at least, get passed through to our tenants, really where it would then affect on phase two to three years of cess pass through the tenants. it would put a damper on our ability to push rents in california, which has been a strong market. so i won't say -- and that's why we like a diversified portfolio that we're trying to grow in california. that said, it's hard to watch all the headlines in california and not be concerned about the economy in california long term. but that makes me appreciate texas and florida and the carolinas as well.
so we're watching it. it will be a delayed impact if it passes, and it will slow our ability to push rents because as ki bin has said once to me, it's a bag of money. i don't care if you call it property tax reimbursements or rents or insurance reimbursement. there's only so many gross rent dollars i can pay. so some of those dollars that would have gone to rents will get pulled into taxes if and when that happens. and we'll manage our size in california, just like we are working on -- have on houston the last couple of years as well.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
maybe you can just -- i know giving an estimate of the impact might be difficult at this point, but maybe you can provide a couple of ingredients, like what is your average vintage here in california? and if you have the data, like what the tax bill is currently in total for california?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
most -- an awful lot of yet where they are kind of -- a lot of what we've got in san diego, i mean there's a number of assets that we've acquired, like the one in rancho cucamonga, where there's been no impact because we just bought it, and we've been active in san diego. that said, in l.a. and san francisco, some of those are legacy assets that we bought in the '90s. so although we've gone up probably 2% year-over-year, we get a bigger hit on some of those assets. we'll be out of santa barbara, knock on wood. and so it's a mix of -- there's a fair amount of the bay area that's older. there's some older in l.a., older. and there's one project in fresno that would be an older bank -- not say older late '90s kind of vintage on those. and so those will be a little more exposed, depending on where they get assessed, too, i guess, is the other thing that's hard to estimate how aggressive the assessors are and how our deals work. so i don't have a number for you today on all of that. and then an awful lot in san diego were probably at market already. they are just in that market.
ki bin kim -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. thank you.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sure.
operator
and we will take our final question today as a follow-up from james feldman with bank of america securities. your line is open.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thank you. just one more quick one. brent, you mentioned $200,000 increases in deferrals from july to now. anything from those tenants? are they more tourism related in houston? or anything else that you can share from that?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
no. it's continued to be a pretty diverse, many tenants, thankfully, not just single tenants that drive the number up substantially. but there's nothing alarming among that $200,000. again, we're very pleased that the total number -- and as marshall alluded to earlier, that seems to have basically just topped out altogether at the 1.7. we've already collected $200,000 of that through september. everything that had been deferred that was due, we have collected through the end of the third quarter. so, we've already reduced that figure at 9/30, i guess, to $1.5 million outstanding. and all but about $100,000 of that is due to be paid back by december of 2021. so our team did a good job of not prolonging the duration of which we were deferring and allowing them some room to pay that at a later date. so it wasn't anything specific or alarming there on the $200,000 or for that matter, really, on the total. it was a pretty diverse mix of a little bit of help to a lot of different customers.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great. thank you.

thanks, keena. good morning, and thank you for your time. we hope everyone and their families remain well and out of harm's way. and i'd like to start by thanking our team that continue performing at a high level, amid a challenging work environment. our third quarter results were strong and demonstrated the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market. the team produced another solid quarter with statistics such as funds from operations came in above guidance, up 6.3% compared to last quarter -- third quarter last year. this marks 30 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend. year-to-date ffo per share is up 7.8%. our quarterly occupancy, while below prior year, was high averaging 96.6% and at quarter end were ahead of projections at 97.8% leased and 96.4% occupied.
our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e-commerce and last mile delivery trends, also benefiting occupancy as a high 83% year-to-date retention rate. re-leasing spreads set a quarterly record at 28% gaap and 16.1% cash. year-to-date leasing spreads were solid at 23.1% gaap and 13.3% cash. and finally, same-store noi was up 3% for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. in summary, during a choppy environment, i'm proud of our team's results. our strategy is evolving to not only include maintaining occupancy, cash flow and liquidity, as has been the case since march. today, we're responding to the strength in the market and restarting development. looking at each of our goals, i'm grateful we ended the quarter generally fall at 97.8% leased, our second highest quarter on record. houston, our largest market, at 13.5% of rents is 96.2% leased, with an eight-month average collection rate over 99%. companywide rent collections remain resilient. for october, thus far, we've collected 97.6% of monthly rents. there's still many unknowns about how fast and when the economy truly reopens and recovers.
we all, as a result, simply have less clarity than normal. brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that in spite of the uncertainty, we're tracking toward $5.35 per share in ffo. this represents a $0.07 per share increase to our july forecast and $0.05 per share above our pre pandemic expectations. helping toward this end, thankfully, we have the most diversified rent roll in our sector, with our top 10 tenants only accounting for 8.1% of rents. as we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand. so with the shutdown, we halted new starts. given the strength we're seeing in select submarkets, we're planning a few fourth quarter starts and pending permitting timing, these will continue into first quarter of 2021. and to position us following the pandemic, we've also been working on several new land sites and park expansion. more details to follow as we close on these investments. other strategic transitions -- transactions we've worked on include our 162,000 square foot value-add acquisition in rancho cucamonga, near the ontario airport and dispositions, which hopefully continue toward closing in houston and on our last property in santa barbara.
and now brent will review a variety of financial topics, including our updated 2020 guidance.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, marshall. good morning. our third quarter results reflect the resiliency of our team and strong overall performance of our portfolio amid a very challenging year. ffo per share for the third quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.36 per share and compared to third quarter 2019 of $1.28 represented an increase of 6.3%. the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better-than-anticipated namely higher occupancy and strong rent collections. from a capital perspective, during the third quarter, we issued $32 million of equity at an average price of $133 per share and earlier this month we closed on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $175 million. the $100 million note was a 10-year -- has a 10-year term with a fixed interest rate of 2.61%. the second note is $75 million on a 12-year term with a fixed interest rate of 2.71%. that activity, combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet, has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility, including the complete availability of our $395 million revolver as of today.
our debt to total market capitalization is 19%, debt-to-ebitda ratio is 4.9 times, and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratios are over 7.4 times. our rent collections have been equally strong. we have collected 99% of our third quarter revenue and entered into deferral agreements for an additional 0.5%, bringing our total collected and deferred to 99.5% for the third quarter. last april, we reported that 26% of our tenants have requested some form of rent deferment. in the six subsequent months, that only rose to 28% and deferral requests have basically ceased. the agreed-upon rent deferrals thus far totaled $1.7 million, an increase of only $200,000 since our report in july. that represents just 0.5% of our estimated 2020 revenues. we have consistently stated the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy is undeterminable.
however, the immediacy and degree of potential tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy we had budgeted for has not materialized. as a result, our actual performance and revised assumptions for the fourth quarter increased our ffo earnings guidance from a midpoint of $5.28 per share to $5.35 per share or a 7.4% increase over 2019. the revised midpoint exceeds our original pre-covid guidance at the beginning of the year. among the budget changes were an increase in average occupancy from 96% to 96.5% and a decrease in reserves for uncollectible rent from $3.6 million to $2.3 million. note that the reserve for potential bad debt for fourth quarter of $600,000 is not attributable to specific tenants. our continued earnings growth directly contributed to increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.3% to $0.79 per share. our third quarter dividend was the 163rd consecutive quarterly distribution to eastgroup shareholders and represents an annualized dividend rate of $3.16 per share. in summary, we were very pleased with our third quarter results. we will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum into next year.
now marshall will make some final comments.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brent. in closing, i'm also proud of our third quarter results. our company and our team has worked through numerous downturns and, while different, will work through this one, too. as the economy stabilizes, it's the future that makes me the most excited for eastgroup. our strategy has worked well the past few years. and coming out of this pandemic, we foresee an acceleration and a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets. meanwhile, our bread and butter traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last-mile distribution space in fast-growing sun belt markets. these, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets, has us optimistic about the future.
and we'll now open up the call for your questions.

operator
certainly. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from elvis rodriguez from bank of america. your line is open.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, guys, and great quarter. just a quick question on houston. so the abr continues to come down for that market. but similarly other markets are now increasing to the high-single digits and low-double digits. where do you feel comfortable longer term on sort of market exposure as you think about acquiring some land parcels and growth [phonetic].
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. good question. i don't know if there is a -- i'd love to say there's a magic number. we'll keep pulling houston down, i think that in a low-double digits, probably would be for any market. i would love to keep runway, we're going to tell our guys in the field, you find the opportunity, and it's brent and my job to kind of have that runway for houston that we don't get oversized in any market. and the good news in a way, kind of managing that, it's much easier to sell a leased asset today than it is to find those opportunities.
so we can manage it, but we'll keep shrinking houston. this year, we were down 80 basis points last year, it will fall in probably another 80 basis points, 100 basis points and that's without really dispositions dialed into this year's budget and we'll probably exit another houston assets or two this year.
so i think if we stayed in that low double digit, that's probably -- we value diversity within our -- within our tenant base is well, -- and as well as geographically as well.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you. and then just a follow-up balance sheet question. so leverage ticked up a little higher quarter-over-quarter and it's slightly higher than the peer average. how are you thinking about funding your capital needs? i know, you're doing some dispositions, but how should we think about the cadence of when you're going to be issuing the equity and how you work through lowering leverage throughout the year?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, elvis. i'll take that. we like our access to debt and equity. frankly, we think both avenues are there and available to us. obviously, a little bit of move in stock price can impact your metrics. but we're very conservative, very lowly levered. we are within a peer group, where there are a few peers that are extremely low levered.
so that on a comparison basis, we're high teens, debt to total market cap and some are even less than that. but all in all, we're in a very good position. we're not capital constrained. so we're more opportunity driven. so if the guys in the field can find those, we have access, i think you will see us hanging generally elvis where we are with the debt metrics we're comfortable there. we're not necessarily looking to de-lever further. but we're not also, you know, opposed to going down either path to be that debt or equity. so i think you'll see us do both, probably a little bit of debt in the early part of the year and also given our current price, if it were to stay there, you'd probably see some equity as well.
so i think you'll see us pull both levers.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks guys, great quarter.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from tom catherwood from btig. your line is open.
thomas catherwood -- btig -- analyst
thank you, and good morning everyone. couple of questions on acquisitions. so, if we go back to the start of 2020 guidance, obviously it was a very different time, but guidance back then was $65 million of acquisitions. you guys ended up closing the year with i think something in the $122 million range. and you've obviously done almost another $17 million subsequent to quarter end. and it sounds like from your commentary on the call, marshall, that the pipeline is looking pretty robust especially in terms of value add and land acquisitions. when you're looking at that $65 million in guidance this year, is that a placeholder? because these can be chunky and it's hard to predict timing? or are you actually seeing more in your kind of shadow pipeline for acquisitions?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning and good question, a mix, i would say, the value adds and two of those we've closed already, one which we announced and it really reads in our press release like and -- more of an acquisition. but in atlanta, the two buildings, we've bought, one in fourth quarter and one in first quarter -- [indecipherable] atlanta chain, they were able to get leased their new buildings, and they were able to get them leased by the time we closed. so they really rolled and never really hit our development pipeline, but rolled in as acquisitions.
so the $35 million in guidance is identified. so hopefully, fingers crossed and we'll be patient, we can find the right opportunities to grow that number and acquisitions is more of an estimate, a little bit and it's unusual the building we bought in northeast dallas, the rock, it was developed as long-term leases. we like the location. we'll pull the trigger every once in a while on a strategic acquisition, but what we're seeing on terms of cap rates and what we're hearing, i think we're better served for our shareholders, if we can really feed our developments into the demand that's out there and find value-add opportunities. and we like that every once [indecipherable] so we can find a local, regional developer and acquirer without the construction risks and take on that leasing risks. we were able to get yields in the high sixes in atlanta and market cap rates are probably mid to low fours today.
so again it's -- and same thing on the rancho distribution center, you saw us buy in fourth quarter in los angeles. we was an owner user and we bought it with the leasing risk, but the team was able to put a couple of tenants in and so that buildings stabilized long term and we think we're 80 basis points to 100 basis points above the market cap rate on it as well.
thomas catherwood -- btig -- analyst
i appreciate that. thank you for that. just kind of following up, you mentioned value add in atlanta and it's tough, it seems like there is some mixed messages in that market for the past two quarters and i know two quarters does not make a trend by any means. but you've had some negative leasing spreads in the past two quarters, yet you've had a lot of success with the value add there, you've added land there. in the third quarter, you mentioned cap rate compression in atlanta as well. can you kind of give us your thoughts on the market there and maybe kind of square up what was happening leasing spread wise with what you're seeing demand-wise in the market?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. it's a fair observation and look, we'd like the atlanta market end at a little bit higher level. the market's growing, rents are growing there, for example, the market vacancy rate is 6.2%, and then if you really look at what we build the smaller shallow bay buildings, it's lower at 4.8%.
so we've been leasing buildings and doing well there. one of the buildings we bought, and it's probably where it's hit us in that same-store pool when we do it annually, so you've got to -- we have to held it all of 2019, as well as 2020 as we're just now starting to approach 1 million square feet. so it's a newer market and as we grew one of the buildings we bought, and we went in, and i'm doing this from memory, which is dangerous, but north of a 7% yield and it was a pharmaceutical company that we knew was going to move out end of their lease and releasing it, there were some rent roll-down.
we like the building, but with a smaller footprint in atlanta, it can give you some kind of core key metrics like we saw in third and fourth quarter. so i think you'll see it normalize and the market rents are growing there and we got back -- somewhat long-winded way of saying we got back some above market space and our small pool of assets in atlanta.
thomas catherwood -- btig -- analyst
understood. thank you everyone.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. you're welcome.
operator
and our next question comes from alexander goldfarb from piper sandler. your line is open.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. so two questions. the first one is, it just -- looking at your portfolio, there is talk in other, some of the other reits about how everyone's starting to look at nashville from multifamily side. and just sort of curious is nashville market that you would look at, and then also, some of your other lighter markets, i know you guys tried vegas for a long time, it's been tough, but like denver. so some of these other markets that are increasingly on the radar for other people to flock to. are these markets that you guys are considering or is it the same rationale that, hey, these are always markets that we're considering. it's just we haven't yet found the right -- the right way to make an entry.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question, and maybe answering it in reverse order, i'll come back to nashville. you're right, we're -- tying to elvis' question earlier is we kind of manage our portfolio allocation among cities. there are some markets we're under allocated in and they're incredibly competitive. we did acquire a project near the denver airport, maybe a year and a half ago now, airways business center, what we've been happy with. and we've chased other things, projects in denver. the problem is there's just so much capital after industrial right now, it's a little bit like the bay area in la, where we are under allocated and same in las vegas. we acquired a value add in las vegas of about the same, about a year and a half ago down near the airport, and near the strip and that's rolled in the portfolio now too, it's leased. but we're looking for opportunities in those markets and being patient and our preference would be to -- the markets, we're already in to grow in those markets.
i guess a little bit of color on arizona, cbre's national team had a webinar yesterday and one of their comments about industrial is the top 40, the top 20 is now the top 40 with so much capital out there after industrial. they're expecting cap rates in places like orlando and charlotte and phoenix, las vegas to continue to compress, because all of that capital can't go into northern new jersey and la and chicago.
so i think it will only get harder for us to find opportunities, but we'll probably keep doing either land or value add and things like that. and nashville is a market that certainly fits our footprint and we like it. it's got a number of our peers already, and certainly not undiscovered, it's probably the hard part. so we'll be patient. and one day we may -- we may be in atlanta and yeah, if we can go back in time, we would have things in atlanta and so we'll be patient.
we'll keep trying to grow where we are. but nashville is -- as we've kind of identified a few markets and we'll do that where we go in and at least kind of like greenville, spartanburg, you saw us enter. we had studied it for a couple of years before we actually found the first and lost out on some offers we made until we kind of find the first thing to collect and now we're adding properties there.
so nashville may get there, one day, but you're right, i'd rather see us grow in denver and los angeles and some other markets before we jump in a new market.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
and then continuing that marshall. so for quite a number of years, you and your peers have mentioned how rents for warehouse users are just really not a big piece of the business, the focus is on transportation and employment as the real cost pressures. just given all the capital pouring in, obviously prices are going up, which means rents have to keep pace to make the math work. do you sense any -- getting anywhere near any sort of pushback on rents or the view is that look, rents still are a negligible part of the tenant's business and therefore as values go up, cap rates come down, etc. the ability for you and peers to keep pushing rents just remains unabated because of the other pressures with the tenants out.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i won't call it -- i'm an optimist, and i don't know that i would go quite unabated. but i guess, as we mentioned, it's been a great run to have -- again we like gaap rents, because you capture the free rent and the rent bumps that we negotiate for. but six years in a row of double digits and really the back half of those three have been higher than the first three and i don't foresee that changing.
we're seeing some construction cost increases and things like that, and land prices, with everybody coming into industrial. it's -- i was surprised to see new entrants into our markets during the pandemic. people moving because it's so hard to underwrite, not that we do it, but i understand it's so hard to underwrite retail and hotel, and office right now that we're seeing new entrants come in, and the tenants and talking to our guys in the field, typically we lose them because of size requirements. they are consolidating locations, they've outgrown their space, or their business has turned the other way and they are leaving the market, it's usually not over rents.
so i'm not quite unabated, but i think we should be able to push rents pretty well this year.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
and our next question comes from emmanuel korchman from citi. your line is open.
christopher mcguire -- citi -- analyst
hi, this is chirs mcguire on with manny. just a quick follow-up on investment activity. as you guys bought a lot of land in 4q, i'm just wondering could you comment on some of your plans for the use of that land?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning, chris. yeah, really last year as covid hit, and our team did a nice job, we said we need -- the land is the one part, you can't really order for development. we can order the steel, the concrete, the glass, but we didn't want to in the last couple of years prior, we were trying to acquire the land really as quickly as we could, and put it into production as quick.
so we pushed the land, kind of our strategy shifted to let's tie up this land and value adds, but close really later as we were -- i guess, we all were hoping the pandemic would be closer to over than it is, but at least to the end of the year, if not into next year. and so the land we acquired last year kind of looking down our press release, it's really all first and second quarter development starts. so, it is 98%. we're happy where we are, happy where we ended the year and really through first week and change in february, we are about the same place in terms of percent leased.
the first part of this year doesn't feel much different than fourth quarter did thankfully. so our plans are to kind of -- to start adding those new phases into our parks as our tenants have started talking about expansion needs and things like that again. and we've seen the leasing activity get a little more broad based. so what we acquired, it's always been our goal to try to put it into production as quickly as we can. and mostly everything you saw is, looking down our list that we acquired in december will either start on plans on first or second quarter just depending on how quickly we can get to permitting and design and things like that.
christopher mcguire -- citi -- analyst
got it. yeah, and just a quick follow-up. i was wondering if you could comment on some small tenant trends. are there any specific industries that are challenged? or has the competitive landscape for some of your smaller tenants changed at all?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think a couple of things -- and i am glad you brought it up. one interesting thing, i think our collections show it that i do think and i won't say people got wrong, maybe i'll take the blame and say i didn't articulate as well. we have smaller spaces, but a lot of our tenants aren't small tenants. we do have some, but our collections really, you know, 99.5% for the last kind of -- through the length of covid show that.
so we have national companies that just need 30,000, 40,000 to 50,000 square feet in markets. industry-wise, nothing jumps out, but the bankruptcies we have, have been more specific. there was a dental company that we had, and so during covid, where people went to the dentist last -- at last. i understand that, a company they're still there, but they transfer people for the military. it's a moving company and the military put a stop on transfers during covid. it's been more you know, people servicing the strip in las vegas and things like that.
training has been a business, i don't know that we have many trainers left in our portfolio but we had a few and that evidently is a pretty tough business. and then one on the flip side that we're benefiting from and i still think there's more runway to, but homebuilding and home renovation as that has picked up and really maybe sunbelt migration has helped us as well. we're seeing more and more demand from people within that industry. and then a lot simply from 3pls and that may or may not be related to homebuilding, but that industry feels very active right now.
christopher mcguire -- citi -- analyst
got it. good color. thanks.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. you're welcome.
operator
and our next question comes from vince tibone from green street. please go ahead.
vince tibone -- green street -- analyst
hi, good morning. you mentioned bad debt expense to be down about 35% in 2021. but how much did bad debt impact cash, same property, noi for full year '20? and also, if you could just touch on how you think about -- you know, what are the normalized level of annualized bad debt to your portfolio, as a percentage of revenue or percentage of noi, wherever you would budget for it?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, this is brent. vince, yeah, we do forecast bad debt going down. that's component of a couple of things. one, feel like it'll normalize, we had a very good collection year, as marshall alluded to we're 99.5% plus, very pleased, have already collected 56% of our deferred rents. so there's only 700,000 or 800,000 left in deferred rent to collect, which the majority of that hopefully will collect this year.
in terms of its impact on same store, it did impact the one write-off i alluded to in the call earlier. in our prepared remarks was a tenant, a single tenant in california, where we're repositioning and moving a lesser credit tenant out for a better credit, much higher rent, but they had a straight line balance of around $680,000. so that had an impact.
but we generally in budgeting events, we look at our historical trend of bad debt relative to revenue. obviously, '20 was an uptick year. but our forecast next year $1.8 million, basically puts us in the midpoint between what we experienced in '20, and versus what our long-term trend is. so we're basically budgeting that to, you know, head back to toward a more normal ratio that is between revenue to bad debt.
so, you know, again, we're very pleased, especially shout out to houston, the collections there have been exceptional. our team there has really worked hard. kevin and his team to keep those numbers up. so, we feel that, that coming down by a third is, for various reasons is very achievable.
vince tibone -- green street -- analyst
thank you for that color. just to maybe follow up there, help me frame the 35% decrease a little bit better. i mean, how much is this maybe going to contribute to same property in '21? is this a 20 basis point positive impact kind of coming off the easier comp in '20 to 50 basis points? is there -- are you able to possibly frame it that way?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, you know, to cash, you'll have a lesser impact. most of that will occur, the bad debt will be in same property. i mean, the only -- by definition, the only part of our portfolio that's not included in same property would be properties that have rolled into the portfolio since january 1 of '20. so just inherently, that decrease for the most part is going to be felt in same store, and i do think, that is part of our upward forecast. we finished the year at about 3.2% same store for '20. and you saw our midpoint guide for next year being 4% and some of that is driven by, you know, part of that bad debt decrease. can't put the exact percentage to that, vince, but obviously, most of that's baked in, just, you know, inherent with the portfolio.
vince tibone -- green street -- analyst
okay, thank you. one more from me, could you discuss any changes you're seeing in the supply picture in your markets for multi-tenant properties, given all the new capital coming into the space?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
most of it still seems to flow, and then maybe that's for you know -- if you said long term, we worry about finding good land sites that we can get though, have the right zoning, or we can get it zoned and are at the right price and don't have the topography that makes it impossible.
most of the new entrants that are coming in, it's still thankfully for us, maybe edge of town, big box development. so if we looked at it that way, it is still, you know, south atlanta, south of dallas, inland empire east, kind of within our markets, it will usually be someone comes in and look, you can put a lot more capital out that way. our average buildings are about $12 million in terms of an investment. and if you build a 600,000 [phonetic], 800,000 square foot [indecipherable] on the edge of town, you can sure put a lot more capital to work, as you're trying to place money or off your industrial allocation.
so that's really where we see that and then maybe like atlanta, where you have that 140 basis points swing and vacancy rates. that's a lot of what's driving that is the new supply typically comes on and it's much larger buildings.
vince tibone -- green street -- analyst
great, thank you.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you're welcome.

and our next question comes from craig mailman from keybanc capital. your line is open.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hey, everyone. marshall, just on the land acquisition that you guys have closed, and one that you're kind of chasing right now. can you just give us a sense of kind of where you're able to underwrite yields today? i'm assuming kind of flat rents, kind of versus the north of seven you've been getting in, you know, just as a -- i don't know if you guys do this in investment committee or not.
but just, you know, the layering in sort of the historic rent growth that you've gotten over the last five years, kind of what the range is of maybe the underwriting at today's rents versus maybe where you've kind of been coming in, as projects have been finished and leased up at these better rents?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure, thanks. and, you know, maybe craig, i'll start with the numerator and work my way to the denominator with all the rents and you kind of filed that away, at least in the back of your head, but we don't change it. we will underwrite rents. and this is what i like, especially if you're delivering two more buildings in an existing park. it is where the rents, and the ti came in on our most recent leasing.
so we'll look at our peers, and we don't factor in rent growth. that may be -- i guess, you could say in hindsight, that's been too conservative the last few years, but we won't factor in rent growth. and then typically, by the time it gets to the investment committee, we'll have the land dialed in, and we'll bid it out to three different gcs for the construction. so we'll have firm construction numbers, and then you're really just trying to manage your risk if anything.
so where that risk remains, is how fast can we lease it off and obviously the tenant improvements. and typically, if tenant improvements start to get a little above normal, then we'll adjust rents with that depending that the term and the tenant's credit and things like that.
so for now, it feels like we're still in that kind of higher sixes to seven, thankfully, and what's helped us is cap rates where we used to -- you know, we typically would target 150 basis points for development risk has been our norm, we're getting closer to 300, as cap rates get into the low, you know, 50. if i round and use a seven and a cap rate of four, you're getting to 250 basis points to 300 basis points. and hopefully we're delivering it a little bit higher rents than we underwrote.
the project in la that we bought, and we thought that we use current rents, and we thought we were going in, in the mid fours and it finished 90 days later, we were able to come in at the high fours, for example. and it was -- that wasn't construction, it was simply able to get better rents, than we had underwritten as that market improved.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
that helpful. and, you know, just going back to your earlier comment to about you know, 20 markets is now the top 40 markets. and, you know, pricing is starting to reflect that, even across kind of quality. just, as you guys look at the portfolio, i'm just curious, i'm going to ask you this in a while.
but are there -- kind of, what's the bucket of non-core stuff that may either just be, you know, a stand-alone not in a park setting that you guys usually like or wrong sub market or maybe tis are going to be higher that you might be able to accelerate given kind of the spreads you are getting in development that could, you know, offset maybe a slightly higher cap rate, but from a portfolio quality and kind of growth accretion longer term, it might just be the right time to maybe try to offload some of these assets, rather than a more deliberate pace?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good -- we've done that a fair amount for us really under kind of '17, '18, '19 last year, you know when kind of the pandemic had really nothing traded for a little bit, i won't say nothing, but with a 15 year lease with amazon type credit, it was aaa things, were about all the traded in third quarter, and then the market seemed to open up.
so it's not a large bucket. i'm glad, where -- they were good assets. and we had gains, i'm glad we're out of santa barbara. i mean, those were really r&d, two storey r&d buildings, not a true distribution market. what you'll probably see this year in our dispositions and we're still working our way through and getting some broker opinion of values is, maybe an asset or two in houston just as we manage in size and really, partly too of wall street's discomfort with houston, we're ok with houston, but clearly, you know, at 20% of our allocation. brent and the team did a good job and created a lot of value, and we needed to harvest some of that value, maybe another way to say it.
but -- and then everyone here and there we'll have some older service center buildings, not a lot, but that's what we were selling in florida. and typically, those are the ones you mentioned, they're single storey and they are smaller tenants where the vacancy will hang around a little bit longer as compared to industrial and the tis a little bit higher.
so we've got a few of those where we're getting some broker opinion of values to exit those. but thankfully, for the most part, industrial has, you know, those have hung in there at least. and i think we should always be selling some things every year. i think if you do that, you can manage it and not let that bucket get too big. you don't want to go to sleep on it. but every year we'll probably -- you know whether it's $60 million or $80 million worth of sales, whatever you can kind of afford -- afford to sell that year and now is a good time to be exiting some of those assets. you're right.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
if you were to think, you know, $60 million to $80 million a year, but if you had, you know to rip the band aid off today, what do you think the value of that or percentage of that of the portfolio will be?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, least, there's probably some -- and i guess it depends on it, i don't have a number because you really get into which industrial buildings after that. there's not -- you know, some of our older ones as we started looking at it, like in los angeles and in the bay area, there are older industrial buildings, and they may not have the physical, you know, basically dimensions of what we would build today, but they're really irreplaceable assets, those would be, you know, i'll go back to our founder that i mentioned, he would-- his phrase was crown jewels for some of those assets that you wouldn't want to sell.
so it's a handful of service centers, maybe five or six throughout the portfolio at most. and then some of our older industrial we really have done that in dallas and houston, and in a number of markets. as we scale it back, we've already -- we're basically down to just our parks in houston. and even then we've sold a little bit of the older product in world houston. so it's thankfully not that much. but i think we'll always be printing [phonetic], i think that's probably what you pay us to do is always be trying to think of -- i think in houston, one of them it was a good park we had built, but we felt like the neighborhood was moving away from us a little bit. and so we exited that park, maybe a couple of years ago now.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
great. thanks.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

and our next question comes from bill crow from raymond james. your line is open. and bill, your line is open. can you check your mute function for us?
all right, and we'll just move on. our next question comes from michael carroll from rbc capital markets. your line is open.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i wanted to touch on, i guess the land purchases, i guess so far to date that you guys were kind of highlighting earlier in the call. i guess marshall, did i hear you correctly in your prepared remarks that you're active looking for more land? is there more closures that we should expect to get done here over the next several months?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we've got a few -- yes, we've got a few more, as we're working through our due diligence, but a few more things tied up and all existing markets are really trying to, you know, ideally, if we have a successful park, and that's the -- maybe the one you saw us buy in creekview for the next phase, for example, the 11 acres where the park leased up quickly, we're out of land. and if we can find, ideally contiguous land, or at least land nearby well, we'll keep moving.
so we've got a few more parcels under contract, we won't go crazy with land because it can become a -- you know, a drag on our earnings if things turn bad. but we like the ratios, the value, and one way we think about it, for example is, if i use the, call it 250 basis points to 300 basis points, if we can pull a successful development off on our pipeline, it will carry the really the land bank where interest rates are and the taxes it will carry our entire land bank for a year.
so there's a little more offset in value creation than land carry. that said, we are mindful of the land carry. and that's why we try to put it into production as quickly as we can. so, but to kind of keep feeding that development pipeline, we've tied up some other parcels. and as we work through due diligence, hopefully you'll see us come -- report back with some closings between first, second, third quarter this year. and there is some markets where we're out of land, if we can find the right size, we'd love to grab it.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and could you talk a little bit about the valuations of land right now? i mean, how much have those prices depreciated? and then, i guess just last one from me off of that, the development starts that you have planned to break ground on this year, has all those projects basically identified on land that you currently own?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll identify that -- and really, we'll get that back from the field, and by quarter what do you plan to build and when, what quarter, and then we'll keep a shadow pipeline, which is a decent list of hey, if that phase goes quickly, what else could we deliver this year. so that's a pretty -- if you imagine a fluid pipeline, but they're all identified and i feel better of our, you know, $205 million in development starts, it's mostly front end loaded. so i feel better rather than hey, we've got to do a lot of leasing and then we'll break ground late third quarter, fourth quarter.
although there's some of that in there, you know, over half is fairly early this year. so that certainly feels more certain and we have the -- you know, the building name and the park and the land and everything lined up, and we're working toward getting those starts off with construction bids and permits and everything else.
and land pricing, it probably held stable. and that's maybe what helped us tie up some of the parcels you saw was close. and it really in december, most all of them were late in the year and that we tied up this year that there weren't many people out looking for land. and that's probably changed in prices. it's hard to say because we struggle for those a bit. there's just not that many, but maybe 10% from where they were a year ago, which is pressuring us, that's a little bit of an estimate.
but places like dallas, and certainly austin, texas, which is a market we like, there is -- with tesla moving there, and some other technology companies. that's a market where we've seen land prices and developers. i'm glad we've got some things tied up in construction under way. but land prices have moved certainly in parts of -- as you'd expect, when [indecipherable] and tesla comes to town and builds a huge plant, same thing we've seen in certain parts of phoenix in the southeast valley with the technology companies growing, the land gets gobbled up pretty quickly by people.
operator
all right. and we will try bill crow again from raymond james. bill, your line is open.
bill crow -- raymond james financial -- analyst
i appreciate it. good morning. can you hear me?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
bill crow -- raymond james financial -- analyst
yeah. hey, marshall. i want to preface my question by just thanking you for the shout out to leland, who not only was the founder of eastgroup in parkway, but really an early pioneer of the reit space in general. so i appreciate that. and i think a lot of people on the phone appreciate that.
my question really is whether you're seeing any material changes on tenant investment levels into your properties. we all think about automation and being big box. and i'm just wondering if you're seeing anything that, that any trend changes and your tenant's part and any changes in trends or longer term trends on tis?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bill, and appreciate the comments on leland and i won't dwell on those too much at least with everybody here. and then -- but yeah, thank the world of him. and on the ti side, with our smaller spaces, we'll probably see it a little bit later than, you know, 700,000, 800,000 foot building. that said, we are seeing tenants putting more of their money in. we've had more and more hvac where it's like manufacturing or depending the type of inventory that they're doing.
we've added parkings and glass more. you know, if you said within our own building design, we've added more glass, sometimes that's been at the city's request or nudging along with zoning and but we've added more car parks, trailer storage and glass to our buildings than we did probably ten plus years ago and we're seeing that hvac and investing in racking and things like that.
so it -- they are getting a little more, which we like, i think that makes it trickier for them to move and stickier in the space. so it's not maybe quite as much automation, as say amazon would have in a big box building, but we are seeing that trend where some tenants and it's usually the national tenants where they have the capital to do it, are putting more and more into their space.
bill crow -- raymond james financial -- analyst
yeah, appreciate it. that was it for me. thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, bill.
operator
and our next question comes from dave rodgers from baird. your line is open.
nick -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. it's nick on for dave. just one quick question on the occupancy pickup in the year-end, how much of that is related to like shorter term leases? and then how much if any, is related to like reverse logistics or inventory return processing for e-commerce firms?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure, that's a good question. not too minimal. we did have at least in terms of seasonal, i can really only think of two places, both with the post office where they jumped out to actually our largest tenant, they had taken some space in san diego through the holidays, what we have read is they're delivering about a third of the packages for amazon.
so in orlando and san diego they took the space, thankfully san diego we're under way with ti, we have the building leased, it was a value add. we acquired at the post office was kind of a placeholder. we got the leasing done and now the ti works being done and really reverse logistics. we have not seen that, i'm not aware of within our portfolio. i'm sure there's sound, there's kind of a sound within the tenant spaces, but really anyone leasing space for us, it's probably a larger return warehouse than we would typically see.
so it's maybe a marginal within a tenant space, but no tenant specifically set up for reverse logistics, but certainly have read about it and followed it. and i think that will continue to, you know, increase new demand within the industrial sector.
nick -- baird -- analyst
yeah. and then just a quick follow up for -- like expectations for 2021. are you kind of expecting e-commerce tenants to more normalize this year? then you've mentioned other tenants, such as like home builders and stuff improving in demand? do you think that they'll be able to like backfill any holes, there might be?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
hope between the two of those they will and when -- we think with a more stable environment, that's part of our optimism and want some things just going on, whether it's, you know, e-commerce growth, it won't have the dramatic growth it had last year, but we do expect it to continue growing. and it's been interesting. we've even had some conversations and these are further down the road, do you end up with some retail facing distribution buildings.
i said at times i do think order online, pickup on store is bigger competition for us than some of the other industrial rates, in terms of how -- where our properties are located in our size spaces. so we think, we'll continue to see that curbside last mile delivery, e-commerce be a driver of demand for us. and i hope -- and again, our traditional tenants, the homebuilding, the home services, the air conditioning, those type guys are not going away, and with a predictable economy, a more predictable economy, we think those expansions because they're for a while and call it 2018, 2019, maybe as much as a third of our new leasing in our park was coming from existing tenants, growing and our retention rate was up last year higher, it's usually about 70, low 70s. it finished the year about 80.
but i think a lot of that which we appreciate was just people put their plans on hold until the world felt a little bit normal. and so i think, you know, it's anyone's guess, but maybe by mid year, you'll see we'll start to see more of those expansions by our bread and butter tenants and our retention rate will normalize back to the low 70s again.
nick -- baird -- analyst
okay, that's it for me.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from vikram malhotra from morgan stanley. your line is open.
elena -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. this is elena from morgan -- for vikram. thanks for taking the question. my first question is just on modeling. how should we think about the trajectory of same store just throughout 2020 through quarter-by-quarter?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
elena, good to hear your voice. you know, same store can fluctuate as you saw in fourth quarter this year, you know, can fluctuate a little bit just based on individual quarterly metrics over a three month period. so there'll be some fluctuation, but overall, we're viewing that to be pretty consistent within that range.
we don't give a quarter-by-quarter same store forecast just because it does have those fluctuations. but as you see, by our midpoint of guide, we are optimistic that, that projection will be although it may have some up and down in it, but the overall trajectory of it will be up.
elena -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then my second question, just more a bigger picture. are you starting to see any benefits from those like larger trends like nearshoring or higher inventory levels? i know inventories currently are at all time lows, and we're going to see those pick up a lot. so just wondering if any of that's manifested in any of your markets?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question. and maybe somewhat and then kind of what we hear about is people will move to, i guess on the near-shoring or onshoring on china plus one strategy where they may go elsewhere, you saw was one of the land parcels we acquired within el paso for example, which is the first time in a while and we'll develop a building there, we'll have a start in el paso, but that's a really low vacancy strong market. and a lot of that we believe is you know, just near shore.
and same thing in southern san diego, that's another market or sub-market we're bullish on. and so we're seeing low vacancy rates. san diego, the south actually benefits from that's about the only industrial land left in that market, but el paso is a strong market. and on the inventory carry, we've had more conversations with tenants and i think we're probably long-winded answers and early innings on both. i think moving manufacturing plants will probably take a couple of years we were guessing and carrying more inventory is probably starting to see it and feel it. and as things stabilize later this year, we'll see more and more of that is what we're expecting.
elena -- morgan stanley -- analyst
awesome. thanks so much. that's it from me.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
welcome.
operator
and our next question comes from ki bin kim from truist. your line is open.
ki bin kim -- truist financial -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. so you've -- you talked about several demand drivers for industrial, like home building, economy opening back up, e-commerce. but i'm curious to high level, how much does simple type population migration or corporate migration, how much is that going to make an impact when you look over the horizon for the next couple years in terms of the demand drivers for your company? given your size on that locations.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. good morning. and look, that's really always been our long term strategy as our buildings, we would say typical, traditionally serve their local market, and we think our infill location in orlando, las vegas, atlanta is awfully hard to replace, and helps you push around. it's happened over the years, and we really feel like with covid, it will accelerate. we've seen, you know, the numbers we've read about in florida and you see it, our numbers there, 1,000 to 1,100 people moving to the state. and then we're about the five major markets in florida.
so i would imagine we're capturing more than our fair share in those cities and was just kind of anecdotally thinking our team in dallas the other day, was showing it was a medical equipment manufacturer and whether we made the deal or not, i'm not sure, but they were relocating from orange county. so we've seen relocations in tucson and las vegas and some of those, but i -- we think you know, in long term that's been one reason we've been successful over the years.
and we expect that to pick up as work from home kind of ripples out and people are more remote and may move out of east coast throughout california. we've same people from the pacific northwest hearing stories that where they've relocated into central florida and things like that, as well. so i think all that helps us whether it's individuals driving demand from our customers or companies relocating where we've had showings for people, you know, looking to move out of california and some -- and out of the northeast other markets that have certainly seen financial firms talk about or move to south florida and things like that as well.
ki bin kim -- truist financial -- analyst
okay. and the second question, when i look at your guidance for capital raises, you have about $250 million at 2.7% projected rate, i'm guessing if i do better than that, but that's what you have tagged in. and then i look at the debt raising from some of your peers in the industrial sector. obviously, there's differences in the size of the company and how long you've been in unsecured debt market that will drive pricing.
but i look at that part, and i just wonder, you know, what are the debt investors looking for -- for you guys to get maybe a little more benefit, where you're not raising money at 2.7%, maybe you're under 2% like some of your other peers? is it just bigger size? you know, just more history in raising debt? i know you haven't done a lot though, just bond markets. but i'm just wondering if there's a second leg to the story where your debt funding cost can go down over time?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ki. that's a very fair question. and i can't say that at times, i'm not jealous against the much larger peers, but you look at some of the spreads, they're able to accomplish. i do think, you know, hopefully, we're being conservative with 2.70% weighted, we've got budgeted on the front end having lower rates than that. and then with some debt with budget, in the back end, we just, you know, showed a little higher rate just out of being what hopefully proves to be conservative.
but, you know, we've had a long history of dialogue with moody's. since they initiated coverage on us going back about seven, eight, nine years ago now, we've been at basically the same rating. so we're obviously quite a different company than we were then. and so we, you know, that would obviously help to get a rung up the ladder there, would help tighten up some spreads.
you know, the unsecured bond market that some of our peers have tapped into, that has basically about a $300 million minimum threshold. and we just haven't been quite that aggressive on the debt side to get, you know, bites that large and we really haven't been of the mind to try to, you know, lever up the line and maybe align that with a maturity to try to get to that level.
so we're still growing in that way, ki bin, but i do think we'll hopefully better than what we have here. but, you know, we're looking for every angle we can to get that down. and hopefully over time, we will continue to benefit from our growth and be awarded there.
ki bin kim -- truist financial -- analyst
i mean, it is interesting because your leverage, excluding developments almost four times that post -- debt to ebitda which is really low and your company's grown a lot. it just seems like the debt market hasn't given you the full respect that you guys deserve right now?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we're going to take you to moody's with us in the next -- we're going to take you to our next moody's meeting in new york, ki bin.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, keena. good morning, and thank you for your time. we hope everyone and their families are well. i'll start by thanking our team for a great year. they continued performing at a high level amid a challenging unique work environment. our fourth quarter and full year results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market.
some of the results the team produced include funds from operation, came in above guidance up 8.7% compared to fourth quarter last year. this marks 31 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend. and for the year, ffo rose 8% to a record $5.38. this represents an $0.08 per share improvement over our original pre-covid forecast.
our quarterly occupancy averaged 96.9% and at quarter end, we were ahead of projections at 98% leased and 97.3% occupied. our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market, with accelerating e-commerce and last mile delivery trends. also benefiting the occupancy was a high retention rate of 80% for the year.
quarterly releasing spreads were strong at 15.4% gaap, and 7.9% cash. our 2020 releasing spreads set an annual record at 21.7% gaap and 12.3% cash. this further marks six consecutive years of double-digit rent -- gaap rent growth. finally, same-store noi rose 2.2% for the quarter and 3.2% for the year. in summary, during the prolonged, choppy environment, i'm proud of our team's results.
today, we're responding to strengthen the market and demand for industrial product by both users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments. i'm grateful we ended the year at 98% leased, our highest quarter end on record. houston, our largest market at 97.2% leased, with a ten-month average rent collection of over 99%.
further, houston represents 13.1% of rents down 80 basis points from fourth quarter 2019 and is further projected to fall into the 12% as a percent of our noi this year. companywide rent collections remain resilient. for january thus far, we've collected approximately 99% of monthly rents. there are still some unknowns about how fast and when the economy truly reopens and recovers.
brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that in spite of the uncertainty, we finished 2020 at $5.38 per share in ffo and forecast $5.68 for 2021. helping balance the uncertainty is thankfully are having the most diversified rent roll in our sector with our top ten tenants only accounting for 8.2% of rents. as we've stated before, our development starts were pulled by market demand. thus, we halted starts for a few quarters last year, then [indecipherable] again in fourth quarter.
based on the market strength, we're seeing today, our forecast is for $205 million in development starts for 2021. and to position us following the pandemic, we acquired several new sites during the fourth quarter with more on our pipeline along with value-added additions. more details to follow as we close on each of these investments.
and to perhaps free [phonetic] up the question, none of the development starts, value add investments or land purchases are in houston. finally, our strategic dispositions during the quarter were to sell the last of our four buildings in santa barbara completing our market exit along with another houston asset. brent will now review a variety of financial topics including our 2021 guidance.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning. our fourth quarter results reflect the resiliency of our team and strong overall performance of our portfolio amid a very challenging year. ffo per share for the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.38 per share, and compared to fourth quarter 2019 of $1.27 represented an increase of 8.7%. the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, namely higher occupancy.
from a capital perspective, during the fourth quarter, we issued $17 million of equity at an average price just over $140 per share, and as previously disclosed, we closed on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $175 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%. that activity, combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility. our debt to total market capitalization is 19%, debt to ebitda ratio is 5.2 times and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased over 7.2 times.
our rent collections have been equally strong. we have collected 99.6% of our fourth quarter revenue and we have already collected half of the total rent deferred early in the year of $1.7 million. bad debt for the fourth quarter of $1.1 million included a single, straight-line rent charge of $677,000 as part of an ongoing process of replacing an existing tenant with a better credit tenant at a much higher rental rate at a california property. although the tenant was current on their cash rent, we were required to write off the remaining straight-line rent balance due to the probability of terminating their lease early to accommodate the new tenant.
as we have consistently stated, the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy is indeterminable. however, the degree of potential tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy we had budgeted throughout 2020 never materialized. as a result, our actual ffo per share for the year of $5.38 exceeded our pre-pandemic guidance issued a year ago.
looking forward, ffo guidance for the first quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.37 per share to $1.41 per share and $5.63 to $5.73 for the year. the 2021 ffo per share midpoint represents a 5.6% increase over 2020. the leasing assumptions that comprise 2021 guidance produced an average occupancy midpoint of 96.4% for the year and a cash [phonetic] same property increase range of 3.5% to 4.5%.
other notable assumptions for 2021 guidance include $65 million in acquisitions and $60 million in dispositions, $140 million in common stock issuances, $250 million of unsecured debt, which will be offset by $85 million in debt repayment and $1.8 million in bad debt, which represents a forecasted year-over-year bad debt decrease of 35%.
in summary, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results. we will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team, and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum into 2021. now, marshall will make some final comments.

thanks, brent. in closing, i'm proud of our 2020 results and excited to pursue our 2021 opportunities. our company and our team are working well through the pandemic, as evidenced by a number of company records set. and as the economy stabilizes, it's the future that makes me most excited for eastgroup. our strategy has worked well in the past few years. coming out of this pandemic, we foresee an acceleration in a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets.
meanwhile, our bread and butter, traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last mile distribution space in fast growing sunbelt markets. these, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets has us optimistic about our future. and lastly, i'll speak for brent, myself and our team to thank our founder, leland speed for his friendship, mentorship and the opportunity he gave us. leland recently passed away, and we will miss his eternal optimism.
and with that, we'll open up the floor for any questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from elvis rodriguez from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on the quarter. just a couple of questions. one on lease termination income increased by a little over 13th quarter-over-quarter, and it was about a penny and a half of the beat versus your guidance. anything you can share on that? is there one specific tenant that drove that or one specific market?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good catch. i'll tie it in there. there really was one specific tenant and really one specific building. i'll if you remember, last quarter, we had a fairly large straight-line rent write-off on a tenant that had been in and out of bankruptcy. we terminated their lease, and then there was another tenant in that same building. it's in south san diego, east lake area. and they had closed down during covid. we collected roughly a $500,000 termination fee from them in first quarter. and then i'll tie it into different pages in our supplement. you saw amazon coming into our top 10 tenants. so they took that same east lake building. basically, what we were trying to do with kind of those chess moves was clear the building out, and we signed 191,000 foot lease with amazon, which was the full building, and it's a 10-plus year lease with them. so we're happy about the outcome. it was -- an i'll credit the team for doing it. it was a lot of moving parts to free up the building, but we were able to improve the credit quality and took the write-off in fourth quarter, and then we're able to negotiate a term fee in first quarter and get that done.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and my follow-up question was going to be on amazon. during our quarterly call with jll, they noted that amazon has been more active in sort of the infill/midsized sizes. and i just wondered if your conversations with them are increasing either in any of your existing markets or even any markets that you may potentially expand to in the near future? anything you can share from that tenant could be really helpful.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. happy to, and we would agree with jll. it seems like kind of a -- globally, most people initially make sense on the e-commerce side worked on getting goods through the ports of l.a. and long beach or whatever port it's say to you in new york or to chicago or the other major cities. in the last couple of years, it's really focused more and more on that last-mile, which we're excited about. as one broker described anything that speeds up when someone hits click or hangs up the phone till it gets delivered is where the world is going. so our conversations with amazon, we were happy to get that transaction across the finish line. we're having other conversations with them and they certainly picked up whether we -- whether they pick us or somebody else's building. we'll see how those play out, but we are seeing them be more active, and i'll say they are -- they seem incredibly busy, and we think they're -- i know people have asked is that is demand going to slow down when amazon slows down? one, we're not doesn't -- from our sense, which is we're a long way from seattle, doesn't feel like they're slowing down. and then, two, we think there's a lot of other companies that we'll have to keep up with amazon to maintain their market share, much less grow it.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you and congratulations again on the quarter.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer

and our next question comes from tom catherwood from btig. please go ahead with your question.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
thanks, and good morning, everybody. taking a look at your value-add acquisitions. the recent trends have been toward more recently completed buildings where you're taking on the lease-up risk. but as you look at your portfolio of value add projects, how much is that kind of unstabilized developments as compared to assets that may be new capital improvements or repositioning? and is there a yield difference between those two types of value add?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question. and and really, i'll give brent credit when we started buying these value adds. it was similar in that it was a partially leased new development. and and we like those as a way as -- a competitive and lowest cap rates have gotten for leased products as a way to create that value somewhere along the spectrum between an acquisition and a development internally. most everything we bought in that value-add bucket has been a vacant building. and then really, the guys in the field have done a nice job where we've acquired things really when the certificate of occupancy has been delivered or -- for the developer or when we get a lease signed. and so you saw that the last two quarters in atlanta, they were able to get those buildings leased by the time the certificate of occupancy was delivered. so they really came in lease. greenville, we've out the building, got a couple of leases signed there, have good activity at 70%. and i can really only think of one, and it was a couple of years ago in south florida that was really in the western area. that was really an older building, and we we did some capital work on it, but we're happy with the yields, and we've been in the 6s to high 6s right now on our development pipeline. so it's harder. i think the market's less and less a freight of vacancy, it feels like each quarter, but we like those looking at our supplement today at a 6.8% yield. and if we can get the leasing done timely as we underwrite them, we think the values are -- depending on the market, but call it, 4. 25, something like that. we -- i will say we did one. i forgot in last year near the ontario airport rancho cucamonga, you're right, that was an owner user that sold the building to us. they were -- they downsized, stayed in the building. we got the balance leased. and so there, we felt like we were probably 75 to 100 basis points above the market cap rate on it. it was a lower yield than in the 6s, but we're in the high 4s and the market for buildings like that are probably high 3s today in southern california.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that color. and some very significant value creation there, which kind of ties into your ground-up developments as well. over the course of the past year, there's been maybe 10 basis points of contraction in your yields, so you're still at 7.2%. when we look at kind of the material increase in construction costs, especially recently, how are you mitigating this to maintain your development yields?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question. and the short answer would be not easily. but we are seeing, especially steel prices come rise. thankfully, we don't use much lumber except for out west. so lumber prices are high. pvc costs are up, although we're hearing those will moderate in time. as we step back, i think it all means we've seen land prices increase as more and more people get into industrial, although, thankfully, they still -- when they enter the market, they typically go into big box development. but i think all that, given how tight land is for industrial and a fast-growing sunbelt market that we struggle to find those sites, i think it's going to all continue to put upward pressure on rents. so i don't know that we'll -- look, i'd love to say we're going to go from 7% to a 7.3% yield on our development yields. but i think, hopefully, with -- our development spreads are as high as they've ever been in our company's history. we would typically historically say 150 basis points above a market cap rate, which would put us about, depending on what cap rate you use, call it, 5.6%, 5.7% today, and we're at 7%. so we've got room to come down, but i hope we don't. and the team continues to figure out ways to get to the 7%. and we underwrite today's rents. and typically, by the time we build the building and get it leased up, we've been able to beat our rents on what we originally underwrote in a rising market the last few years. and i think it will accelerate now with higher land prices and higher components. and i think at least for 12 months, supply is going to be constrained because even if you agree to pay those higher steel prices, it takes a while to get deliveries.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
understood. we've heard the same in multiple areas. and speaking with land, just one last question. one parcel popped up in your prospective development list, 42 in san diego, california. we didn't see anything come off out of the operating portfolio, nothing you've acquired recently. what is that parcel?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good and good. good observation. i think, i'd say it was late 2019. we bought this site. it was a couple of sites in san diego. and this one is otis. so really, near the mexican border, the border with mexico between the two border entries, the existing one and there's one under construction today that we plan to start construction. it was a salvage yard. and as we've worked through with the county of san diego to get that ready for development, we -- since it has income coming off, it was an operating property, but as we've -- as we get closer to being able to break ground, we cleared the salvage yard tenants, which were really there month-to-month. and so it really -- a good catch, but it's really us getting ready to, hopefully, break ground this year, and we'll chasing some build-to-suits. that's a strong market or -- and/or spec development there along the border. and similar, there's one other asset that falls in, in san diego in the miramar area. we bought what was a car lot along the i5 right across the freeway from la jolla that's a covered land play. it's parking for the miramar navy base today for the va hospital. so we have couple of those, which is a great way to kind of carry the land until we're ready to start development, but that's what happened with that 40 acres, and we like the market a lot, and it just takes a bit to get through all the improvements and entitlements in san diego that we're about there.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
that's it from me. thanks everyone.

our next question comes from daniel santos from piper sandler. please go ahead with your question.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. congrats on a great quarter. i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more commentary on houston and rents and what you think rents will do over the next few quarters?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
okay. sure. dan, and thanks for the compliment on the quarter. if it helps -- i'll start with houston market and then maybe jump in to east group. but -- and i'll apologize, i'll throw some stats at you. but the vacancy rate, houston, and this is from cbre, where i'm quoting is down to 6.5%. so that's -- we think the market overall is improving, or it is improving. houston continues to grow vacancies 6.5%, and that's fall in the last two quarters. constructions right at $21 million, and that's thankfully 65% leased, or pre-leased. and jll is tracking just over 21 million square feet of requirements. so hopefully, those requirements turn into leases, and that continues to stabilize that market. and then within east group, as you saw, we're 96.9% leased. we -- at quarter end, we had 8.7% rolling. that's down to just over 7% today with a large portion, about 40% of that rolling at year-end. so as we've been saying, houston is not our best market, but it's certainly a stable market, and it continues to shrink within eastgroup. it was -- it's down 100 basis points from 12 months ago, and will probably do similar to that in the next 12 months. i think i'll credit the team. they got a lot of leasing done during the first quarter. the rents compared to where the prior rents with the annual bops roll down where the market is, but the market is improving. i think those -- we believe those negative numbers that you see in first quarter will moderate and improve by the end of the year, but that's a market that's still recovering a little bit. definitely, with covid had slowed down, but is improving. and -- but we think we'll be fine. we'll be stable in houston this year, and it will improve, but it won't be our -- it's not one of our hottest markets, but at 97% with 7% rolling and the activity we've had there, we feel pretty good about houston going forward long term.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. that is super helpful. so my next question is on occupancy and maybe it kind of feeds into a larger question on guidance and being conservative. when we kicked off the year, it seemed like the team was fairly cautious on occupancy and was -- that was the case last year and yet both this year and last year have turned out to be better than expected, i would say. so i guess my question is, are you still cautious on occupancy? and was that driven by sort of a general view? or did you have sort of key leases in mind? and is that sort of driving your conservativeness on the guidance given that you beat us by $0.05, which would imply a better year than the $0.11 guidance increase?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
dan, this is brent. yes. i think the -- what proves to be conservative maybe doesn't quite feel as conservative when we go out there, i mean, finishing the quarter at 98.3% leased, which, again, was a record high lease percentage on top of the prior quarter, which had been the prior record. so the team continues to do a terrific job. i would say one thing that was real satisfying this quarter is that we had some known vacates, and i'll say, especially in houston, but we had space roll and then yet it immediately turned and got relet. you see our renewal percentage this quarter was a little bit low at right around 59%, 60%, but would point out that we had released a significant part of that for various reasons, tenant that didn't renew. and so we wound up taking care of 93% of that space within the quarter, and we just didn't anticipate, among other things, but we didn't anticipate taking care of that vacated space so quickly. and so everything from that regard just continues to to hit well. if you look at our midpoint of our average month end occupancy, it's within 10, 20 basis points of what we've averaged the last couple of years. we're certainly off to a strong start to the year, first quarter. we hope you're right. we hope that the midpoint -- we have now proves to be conservative yet again. but when you start getting into these sorts of percentages of figures, it's harder than you think to press yourself to start getting toward forecasting, let's say, we're going to have another record quarter next quarter. and so we have good momentum. we'll keep going with -- the team's executing terrifically. but we feel -- that said, we feel good about the numbers, and april is looking strong coming into the beginning of the second quarter. so we will just continue to execute as best we can.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. i appreciate that. congrats again. and that's it from me. thank you.

and our next question comes from manny korchman from citi. please go ahead with your question.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
marshall, given the commentary so far on the call about how competitive and industrial markets have become, should we expect -- or have you given your team any new tools or sort of maybe card rails about what they should be out there looking for? or if not, how do you expect to keep growing the company?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean i think maybe good question. maybe broadly speaking, we want to keep growing our -- and when we say growth, want to keep growing our earnings, our ffo per share. but in terms of just absolutely growing volume in terms of assets, we try to shy away from that. i mean, we want to have the appropriate amount of float in our shares and things like that for our investors. but we've really never said we've got to grow by x number of millions per year because i think that leads us to be an undisciplined investor. we can meet those goals. those are usually pretty easy, but there'll be things you may be picking on us about in two or three years when we're struggling with them. but that said, i mean, we do talk about our cost of capital regularly with the team and have tried to staff up and give them the people under our three regionals that they need. and really, our best opportunities, as we said, we've tried to reduce administrative time. we've -- our internal reporting, we've changed the way we've done that, a fair amount over the last, call it, two to four years, have learned the phrase from one of our directors of corrupted sales time.
so we want -- we're telling our team, go right around, go to lunch with brokers, go to happy hour with brokers, host it, do things like that because we think non-listed properties are the best opportunities like the sale-leaseback that we bought at the ontario airport. by the time one of the brokerage groups gets it, they're all so good in marketing. it does become a bit of a feeding frenzy. and every once in a while, we'll buy one of those strategically. so they're aware that we can go to lower yields than we could a handful of years ago, and we're -- we bid on a lot. we just don't buy a lot. and given where the world is and cbre's phrase, there's a global wall of capital that wants u.s. industrial. and so we've trying-ed to tell ourselves rather than outbid that global wall of capital, everybody's got a checkbook. if everybody wants it, we're better off creating it than outbidding people. so we like development a lot. we like value add where it makes sense. and we'll pick up some acquisitions here or there. i know we lowered our guidance this year. it's not that we're shying away from acquisitions. we'll chase them just as much, but it -- that represents a property we have under contract in one of our submarkets. we're in our due diligence on it. and i hope that's a number we beat.
we just recognize just when we think it's competitive that next year gets more competitive. the phrase we've heard is that top 20 markets are now the top 40 markets out there. so it's surprising how much competition there is in tampa and denver and las vegas. we expected in l.a., atlanta, dallas, those major markets, but even what people would call kind of our next 10 to 30 markets around the country are incredibly competitive. we were recently in greenville, south carolina, which is certainly a smaller market and just a number of players there out bidding for properties and how cap rates have come down. we like the market a lot, but we'll just be -- i think our best serve for our shareholders is to be a patient disciplined, investor, and we'll find our opportunities here and there. and luckily, doing that, the company continues to grow and maybe in spite of our conservatism at times.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
great. i appreciate that. and maybe the complete opposite of that. you talked about leasing up the building in san diego to amazon on what sounds like a whole building basis. what's the thought process between either keeping that in the portfolio long-term and sort of what's the upside in doing that versus selling that to fund some of this more expensive acquisition and development activity?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
that's a thought. we -- and i guess we just got the lease sign. so we thought we'd -- a little bit less link to dry before we come up with our plan, but yes...
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
put it right on the market. no time off.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
okay. i hear you. yes. we just wanted to signature we caned. we were going to order a set of pens and have them delivered with amazon prime in seattle and things like them trying to get the lease signed. and so yes, we -- there was -- i mean, arguably, we could have created as much as $0.50 a share in nav, i'll credit the team for getting that done in terms of cap rate swing on that building. and it's one we could sell, although it's -- and it's one we've owned for 20 years. i'll take the blame of the credit. it was one i had acquired even way back when i was out [indecipherable] adding order and we'll prune our weaker assets and -- but there's so little land in san diego. well, let's talk about at the next city conference. i would argue on the it's over a 10-year lease that when this amazon lease burns off and over 10 years, there's going to be that much land left in san diego between camp pendleton, pacific ocean and mexico and mountains that we like that infill southern california market like san diego. but that's probably a good discussion we'll have, and we're happy to get the lease signed. and i promise we'll get back to work and not take time off and figure out what do we -- now that we call the bus, what do we do with it?
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst

out next question comes from vince tibone from green street advisors. please go with your question.
vince tibone -- green street advisors -- analyst
hi, good morning. i have a question on your full year guidance for the reserves for uncollectible rent. i'm curious if the guidance revision was solely due to the kind of unexpected recoveries in the first quarter of previously written-off rent? or have your views on overall tenant health changed over the past few months?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes, vince, product combination of both. the first quarter as you see that we actually turn out to be a positive $78,000 as it comes to bad debt. and that was simply -- we had reserved a few tenants that we had deemed and thought would be uncollectible at 12/31. and it turned out those tenants fall and got current. and so we basically reversed what we had previously allowed for and then that just wasn't backfilled with new collection concerns. so for the first quarter, that out to be basically no bad debt. and so we did ratchet back the second quarter -- or the total, we brought down to 1. 1, but we were looking at the second quarter we had put about $225,000 there and then about $500,000 in the third and fourth quarter. and we feel good. even through april here, we're looking good. collections have been very, very strong. we collected in the mid-99% of first quarter rents, which is basically the same as we did last year. and so we feel good about collections. we hesitant to bring it down lower. just -- you get two or three tenants. when you've got 1,600, 1,700 customers, and when you're saying that just a handful could absorb the number you have in there, you're hesitant to take it down even further, but we feel good, obviously, real positive about first quarter. and those aren't tenant specific. our allowance is just general, again, given that many tenants assuming something will happen. but hopefully, we can continue to unwind that. it's -- at the 1.1, we're already down just over 60% -- or forecast to be down just over 60% from what the prior year was. so again, just a testament that our multi-tenant -- our ""smaller tenant base"" has held up just fine, and i don't want that to get lost on folks because it all look for us, but the more we can build a track record, hopefully, the more that allays those fears.
vince tibone -- green street advisors -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful color. one more for me. are you seeing any material differences in tenant demand or just kind of fundamentals between the markets that are now fully open from a covid mandate perspective versus those where there's still some restrictions in place?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
trying to understand your question correctly. i would say we're -- it probably feels more like everything shut down, call it, a year ago, almost all of our markets. and then as -- and really, thankfully, the southeastern markets, the georgia, florida, carolinas opened up, texas a little bit first. we we felt that activity, and now it feels a little more broad-based, or it is. california, we struggled leasing some vacancy in the bay area. and the market was always strong. it was just not many people out looking for space, say, compared to tampa there for a couple of quarters. and we've seen it even -- and we feel better, and we'll get there on a miami development, where we built the third building and a park. the first two leased up before we could complete them, but miami was another market where it felt like, with covid, it had slowed down. so it does feel like more and more of our markets are really fully open or a little more even now, i guess, maybe is another way to say it. we're sending out more proposals than we have traditionally. and that's maybe partly why we saw so much new leasing. i'd say the flip side of that is deals still take a while to get done. so it's a slow process and maybe the best answer to that i've heard is our rents are higher than they were a few years ago and spaces have gotten a little bit larger for our tenants. so the level of approval or the amount of scrutiny is going up. so there's a lot of deals that will happen, but they'll stall out kind of in the red zone until we get signatures. but we've seen more and more pickup in the market in terms of activity. and then -- and you're right, it really depends on when kind of the government let those markets reopen a little bit over the last year and each quarter. til now, they all feel like they're pretty much open, although some of them feel like they just reopened here in the last 90 days is more shots got in arms.

our next question comes from dave rogers from baird. please go with your question.
nick thillman -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. this is nick on for dave. i had a question if you've been hearing anything from tenants about employment shortages and it might be impacting their business?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we're certainly seeing that around the country or it feels like i've heard more about it in service businesses than i have within our tenants as well, but it does feel like people are having a hard time hiring workers, which is crazy right now, but but hiring people, and it probably hits the larger the space, the more people intensive. some of ours aren't quite as -- an 800,000 foot industrial building is going to have a lot of people in it, and labor is going to be a key decision-maker part of their decision with ours, which really that last-mile quick delivery. i know there's a -- i've read about -- i was watching a shortage of truck drivers and things like that. and i think that was all going to lead companies more and more toward automation. we're already seeing that, but that will pick up. we're not hearing it as directly, but we are glad to see our customers starting to expand. that really had slowed down. that partially led, and brent commented on our retention rate that, that was one as our tenants are actually starting to expand, but i do worry about the labor shortages that are out there a little bit. it seems more service-oriented than warehouse, but it's got to be a little above.
nick thillman -- baird -- analyst
and then just one quick follow-up on something you guys said earlier. land as a percentage of construction costs, where would you guys peg that today?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
land as a percentage of...
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's probably around 25% to 30% and maybe slightly growing, although, as marshall said, there's some component costs like steel that that are increasing. and the question earlier about the yields and the impact and how we're mitigating that, some of that really is going to be the challenge this year. a lot of what's in that pipeline is kind of prebaked with some of these supply chain conundrums. but it generally -- it can vary in different places, but generally going to be in that 25% to 30% range of total all in.

our next question comes from michael carroll from rbc capital markets. please go with your question.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i guess, marshall, over the past several quarters, i mean, you've detailed how prospective tenants is kind of broadening out for you, including a much bigger pool of national players looking at your properties, combined with the smaller local players. i mean -- and obviously, this has changed your top 10 tenant list. i mean, are these national players more active today than the local players? and we should continue to expect that top tenant list to continue to evolve?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i think it will continue to evolve, and you did see, i guess, a couple of new names in it this quarter that we've moved in. i hope we've kidded our own board. i hope we have the issue of how big is too big for one of our tenants. i like -- and people certainly i'll get on my soapbox for a moment as people focus on houston for us and concentration there. we're -- i think geographic concentration is important for us to manage risk, but i also think tenant concentration is another great way to manage risk. and we really -- i don't know that people focus on that as much. i like that we're a hair below 8%, but i do see as some of our tenants those national tenants -- what's been interesting to me is we'll see them in tampa or orlando or in a market. and next thing we know there we're sending out proposals throughout the portfolio that i hope we have the issue is how much is too much home depot or best buy or lowe's or amazon or wayfair any of those tenants. so i do -- i think as they all work on their supply chain and logistics, and then they've all been caught without inventory, especially this past year. so we think it will also lead to -- is their logistics move our way and will likely carry more inventory as what we're reading and hearing about over the next few years, we will -- i think it's a good prediction that we'll be managing the size of some of those tenants, and maybe i'll go back to manny's question. worst case, we create so much value with amazon, and they're so concentrated. we need to sell an amazon building or two, but be a great -- a world-class problem to deal with when and if we get there. first, we need to get the leases signed. but i think you're right. i think we'll end up with a little more tenant concentration over time, although we'd like -- and we'll try to manage that number and keep it low as best we can.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i mean you have great tenant diversification today. i mean, what is too much? i guess, what's that number is at 5% of rents? or i mean is there a number that you're thinking about right now?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
there's not -- we've talked about it, not a specific number. the other thing is we've -- you're right. thank you. it's not a problem today, but you don't want to wait until it is a problem. the other thing i thought we should layer in as we look at that is what are the terms of the leases. i mean i'd like, say, [indecipherable] is one of our top 10 tenants, good company. but their 3pl typically a shorter-term lease. if someone's 5% and everything is a 3-year lease, that's a different model than if we've got someone and how many locations is that, too. i feel better about having multiple locations because you're probably not going to lose all those locations at once. so to me, it would be probably -- and i'm good at over analyzing things, it's a personal therapy comment. but how long are the lease terms, how many locations and who that tenant is? and i think we'll -- that's probably as we get to each one is probably how we should -- that should be the framework we look at.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess, switching over to developments. i guess, what's the governor of starting new development projects? is it the ability to find land? or is it that you're just trying to manage risk, you don't have too much on leased developments in process at any point in time?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
it's really what -- good question. what i love about our model is it's not brent and me saying, go, really, the governor, i would put it back on the market. if our guys can find the right land sites, and we wouldn't build two competing parks within the same submarket, but we could be -- we're active in several submarkets in dallas, atlanta. we could be in san diego, some of our larger markets. it's really how fast did your last phase of that building lease-up and did it kind of meet or exceed our pro forma and as fast as -- we've told the team as fast as you can deliver them and get them leased up, we're ready to go with phase two. so the market really pulls our supply. so that was how our starts got so far out ahead in 2019 of where they -- we thought they would be. i hope we have that issue as this year as it plays out, although we've got to get the steel for it and all the components and things like that. i could see some delays that way. but it's really -- we'll build phase four as fast as you can lease phase three. and i've always kind of thought of almost like a retail store. we're restocking the shelves as fast as you can sell it. and look, it's -- i like our model. we'll build roughly a $12 million building. where our yields are versus market cap rates? it will come out being worth about $19 million, which is a great net asset value creator. and how many times can we do that before we run out of land or get too far out over our skis? but if we can do that in as many markets where the demand is there, that's why you saw us say, buy a site in paso where we haven't built in years was that the market strength was there. we had internal tenants who wanted to expand. so the team found a contiguous site to some buildings that we owned, and we'll break ground there later this year. so we'll go -- long, long-winded way of saying, we'll go as fast as the market lets us go.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you.

our next question comes from craig mellman from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead with your question.
craig mellman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys, just maybe circling back to the acquisition question, and i appreciate your commentary that you don't want to just got the reckless abandon given a positive cost of capital here. but what we've seen in the last decade almost is, right? everyone's been conservative on underwriting rent growth and thinking that people that are winning bids are crazy, only to see rents grow faster than expected and cap rates compress, right? and then you have the remorse of not being more aggressive. i'm just kind of curious, as you guys sit there today and underwriting committee, how much that factors in, particularly for well-located product? where -- how much you're willing to stretch to get the foothold in some of these markets where you want a bigger exposure versus not wanting to be, as you said, lambasted in two years if something goes sour, right? so just kind of curious on your thought process there. and i guess putting something else in the mix, too, is your markets are now seeing more national tenants come in. those tenants tend to be less price sensitive. so kind of how does all that fit into -- when you guys are saying they're deciding to allocate capital, which i know it's tough when you have 300 to 400 basis points breadth of development, but there's only so much land to buy?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good thought progress and brent and the finance team right now, we're thankfully not -- we don't feel capital constrained. the equity markets are attractive, the debt markets. so we're not really looking at do we build a building or do we buy a building? thankfully, we have the luxury of -- we can do both as long as that one particular market doesn't get outsized, like you'd manage your stock portfolio. and we do feel like we stretch. i've always thought our best decisions when you're buying something, it's it's half analytical, and we certainly see some people that it's -- they're so focused on the computer and the model that you miss. really, we have the luxury also of being a long-term owner of what do you think about this location and where do you think it will be in five, 10, 15 years? we're not private equity, where we need to be thinking about exit within just a handful of years. i think that's a lot harder way to buy. and you're right. thankfully, the market's gone our way all the industrial owners the last handful of years. so we're -- we feel like we're stretching, and we'll keep chasing those assets. and we bid on a lot, and maybe we should stretch more than we do, but we kind of -- we try to come up with a number early on, and we say, all right, at this price, before you get too heavily involved and when you're in the third round of bidding and the buyer interview it, i just -- including me, it becomes more emotional. and we said, all right, how much do we want to pay for this asset early on? and what's our bidding strategy?
and we try to stay pretty pretty self disciplined around that because you can get in the bidding and you want to win it, and we're all competitive. i don't know that winning out of 20 bidders is really winning and just betting on the market, it keeps setting new highs, but i hate to bet -- keep betting that it's going to go to another high. and what in if it does, we've got $47 million square feet that we'll bend today that will benefit, we will benefit from that as well. so we'll buy some things, but we try to not buy based on what our stock price is today, but if it's an asset we like and it strategically fits where we're trying to grow in jacksonville or austin, texas and things like that, we -- look, our company is probably 2.5 times the size it was three or four years ago. so we feel like we are growing. we were under $3 billion. and some of that stock price growth, things like that, we've grown pretty rapidly and our development pipeline used to be $100 million a year. so it's grown as well. we'll grow as fast as we feel like we can, but i don't want to blow up the perfectly good 30-year-old reit because we wanted to grow too rapidly or things like that. we'd rather find that value for our shareholders, and we'll go as fast as we feel like we can reasonably find those opportunities.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would just add to that, craig, that like marshall said, we view that we're being paid to create value, and we don't necessarily view as our key role is a component, but not a key role of being a roll-up per se. but one thing i think maybe gets lost with these group. you look at our yields relative to, perhaps, the peer group, given our smaller building, multi-tenant approach, which has less competition -- some competition, but less. but in the last four years, we've converted the development value-add $725 million at cost that's worth, if you put a 4.5% cap on it, which i probably conservative there, is worth over $1.2 billion. so we're making a 60%, 65% return on the last four years in those two buckets. so we spend a lot more time on those. frankly, we look at acquisitions in every market, but we view that as far less accretive to the shareholder. so it's a component, but with today's cap rates, we just don't view it as a key component.
craig mellman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
no, that's fair and helpful on your thought process. just on -- maybe one quick follow-up to that. when you guys do kind of not end up being the winning bidder, how far off generally are you versus the winter?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
it depends. we've have to bat is it better to get -- sometimes we don't make it to the second round. and you realize, ok, we weren't going to be close. the market sees something there. and then it varies. sometimes, we're right there. we do a -- usually have a first round bid. they narrow it to a second round bid. then you have a buyer interview, and then you get a call from the brokers saying, you're bidding against yourself this entire time of -- if you can come up $100,000 or depending on the size of the project, $400,000, you can get the property. so those are the ones where you want to be a little more disciplined. but we -- it's a range -- we'll usually -- if it's something we like, we'll usually almost always make it into the second round, and the brokers will guide you through the process a little bit of where you need to be to make that second round or the buyer interview. and sometimes we simply try out uncle. but it's amazing. and last couple of deals we bought, honestly, that even after we were awarded it, people came in with a higher bid. there's one in california in the last year, and we were in the $20 million. and even after we were awarded it, somebody came in with $1 million more within their offer and, thankfully, the seller stuck to their word and honored it. but it's -- i guess the good news is -- or the bad news is it's awfully competitive on acquisitions, and we can get close on them. i guess that's the good news. we can't have a high stock price and have people not want to own industrial. so it really pushes us, as brent said, rather than be an asset aggregator, we'd rather create that value. again, you can create value by raising rents, we admit. but we'd rather build it or buy a vacant and/or push rents along the way. so we -- i think we'll buy more than $10 million probably by the end of the year. but as we came up with our guidance issue, we stuck with $10 million because that's what we have under contract. and we'll be patient, and we'll find it. and that's a hard one to predict is the other reason we predicted $10 million because everything gets multiple bids these days.
craig mellman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. then just, hopefully, a quick one here. going back to the talk about maintaining development yields. and apologies, we haven't been able to go out and see any new developments lately, but are you guys -- you guys have historically have had more office component in some of your shallow bay than traditional just distribution. is that mix changing at all, which is kind of supporting the yields a bit? or are you guys caustic into the same office percentage historically?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
office percentage has stayed similar. we're probably at 10% to 15%, which you're right, would be bigger than a large box building just by its nature. but we're -- office percentage is similar. if there's anything we've seen, and it's probably the nature of where we are in arizona and las vegas, we've seen more air conditioned warehouse uses. if somebody has some kind of light assembly or depending on -- we lease space in las vegas. we're near the strip, and it was a candy company that distributes to the strip. so it makes sense. it's -- because it's hard to store chocolate in the desert in july without it being air conditioned, but we are seeing more and more demand for that from tenants. so if you say what -- what we've added more parking. we've added more trailer storage over the last few years. i don't think that's really -- that helps you stand out when people are looking for spaces, but i don't think it helps our yield. if anything, we'll end up same amount of office and maybe a little more air conditioned warehouse space than we had six, seven years ago.
craig mellman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and our next question comes from bill crow from raymond james. please go ahead with your question.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning, guys. marshall, a couple of questions on the larger national tenants. you talked about the maneuvering you had to do in san diego to move amazon. and i assume that amazon and a bunch of these other bigger national tenants prefer not to be in multi-tenant properties. so do you find yourself contemplating more larger single-tenant buildings to accommodate these larger tenants as you go forward?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
probably not. i mean, a short answer would be that building was 190,000 feet, and that's on the large end of what we own. and we do see home depot and they've come that's buying a 40,000-foot in charlotte, multi-tenant building. so i think most tenants ideally would like their own building, but it's really been more -- last conversation i had, was on a lowe's project. they were looking in one of our markets about number of.doors and trailer storage. so i don't think we'll really -- we've grown the size of our average building slightly over the years, but we really -- we like where we fit in the food chain. i like our yields at 7% compared to some of the big box yields where i've seen kind of mid- 5s to 6% that people have reported. and so we'll probably keep building the same buildings. it's really getting the location and dop doors and trailer storage and you're right, they've been -- they're less price-sensitive as if you can deliver the right real estate. and for amazon, it really worked in san diego. we had the right square footage in the right location for them. but just sticking with them, and you see it on our top 10 that they took 10,000 feet, just using them as an example and tucson a year or two ago. so that one was kind of interesting and maybe educational for me that to deliver bulky items that they would be willing to go that small, but we have the right location that they needed in tuson.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
no. are you -- a follow-up question here. are you getting the inbound requests from the tenants to take care of their needs in other markets that -- whether you're in those markets or not? are they starting to generate more leads?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
we work on that. i mean we have had some -- we're -- thankfully, we've developed those relationships, and i'll credit our team in the field. we will go to their corporate office, have those conversations, and companies like lowe's and home depot, where i think they're used to -- and i am -- this is me assuming as much. that's by retail leases that are much longer and lengthier than in a typical industrial lease. so simply having gotten through the lease process. if we can use one of our conforming leases and take what we did in charlotte and move it to austin, i think it makes it -- it's easier on the real estate teams because all those companies also seemed to me to be incredibly busy and understaffed right now, broadly speaking. but i think we do have that advantage. and even one tenant was looking at going to a new market. they'd rather leased and owned, but they presented us with that building. in that case, it didn't work out. we really didn't like the building that much, but it was not retail related, but a solid tenant that we have elsewhere. and they approached us on buying the building to lease it back to them. so i love it when things like that happen. and i think if we can kind of keep managing those relationships, goodman was another company, large ac contractor. when we went to fort worth, they were with us in dallas and kind of made the comment that the traffic was so bad in dallas, they needed a fort worth location. so we were able to accommodate them and take them to fort worth as well, for example.
bill crow -- raymond james -- analyst
all right, thanks appreciate it.
operator
and our final question today comes from kubin kim from temis. please go ahead with your question.
kubin kim -- temis -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. a lot of good questions have been asked already. so just a quick one here. how would you describe the changes in your overall tenant credit profile in your portfolio? and i don't mean how many more tenants are rated by rate investment-grade by fitch and moody's, but talking about a real world credit?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's, i guess, an interesting question, ki bin. i mean, we've got 1,600, 1,700 customers. i think obviously, we analyze -- especially when you're signing a new lease, we have a process that all our asset team follows in terms of analyzing the credit of a tenant various things go into that. i mean, the credit view on an as-is deal where no ti or capital is required, we may look at slightly different than, say, a build-to-suit, where you're committing lots of dollars and, perhaps, a long-term lease. but we revisit those. we run d&b reports for those tenants and that type thing. but, ki bin, i guess what i would point to and i mentioned earlier is i think the greatest testament to our tenant credit profile is how we performed relative to, say, comparison to big box peers and/or how we've performed in economic downturns where you can compare some companies that focus on one size versus the other. and again, what we've seen is that there's not a disconnect between how big tenants perform relative to smaller tenants in those situations.
and as we've said before, being in a smaller space, doesn't necessarily mean that you're lesser credit. we think the focus more is what is the business that the tenant does. i mean there's plenty of very, very large companies publicly traded companies out there in the world today that are struggling for a myriad of reasons. and some of them not of their own doing with the pandemic, but nevertheless, they're struggling. and so we spend a lot of time and focus on that, again, especially in new leasing, but we feel like we've put down a track record to show that within the multi-tenant space, we're the high rent provider. we -- in our markets, we are the class a multi-tenant. we're not -- as we say, in the field, we're not shading shelter sort of landlords. so along with that comes a better credit profile because they're having to pay up for quality space. so hopefully, that answers it, ki bin, but it's -- we feel like we've laid down a track record shows a good credit profile.
kubin kim -- temis -- analyst
thank you.

good morning, everyone, and welcome to the eastgroup properties first quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. [operator instructions]
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to marshall loeb, president and ceo. sir, please go ahead.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, and thanks for calling in for our first quarter 2021 conference call. as always, we appreciate your interest. brent wood, our cfo, is also participating on the call. since we'll make forward-looking statements, we ask that you listen to the following disclaimer.
keena frazier -- director of leasing statistics
please note that our conference call today will contain financial measures such as pnoi and ffo that are non-gaap measures as defined in regulation g. please refer to our most recent financial supplement into our earnings press release, both available on the investor page of our website and to our periodic reports furnished or filed with the sec for definitions and further information regarding our use of these non-gaap financial measures and reconciliation of them to our gaap results. please also note that some statements during this call are forward-looking statements as defined in and within the safe harbors under the securities act of 1933, the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements in the earnings press release, along with our remarks are made as of today, and we undertake no duty to update them whether as a result of new information, future or actual events or otherwise. such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those directly and indirectly related to the outbreak of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that may cause actual results to differ materially. we refer to certain of these risks in our sec filings. thanks, keena. good morning, and thank you for your time.
we hope everyone and their families are well. i'll start by thanking our team for a great quarter. they continue performing at a high level and reaping the rewards in a very positive environment. our first quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market. some of the results the team posted include funds from operations came in above guidance, up 10.7% compared to first quarter last year, and $0.06 ahead of our own guidance midpoint. this marks 32 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend. our quarterly occupancy averaged 97%, up 20 basis points from first quarter 2020. and at quarter end, we're ahead of projections at 98.3% leased and 97.2% occupied. our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e-commerce and last-mile delivery trends. quarterly releasing spreads were among the best in our history at 25.8% gaap and 16.1% cash. finally, our same-store noi rose by 5.9% for the quarter. in summary, i'm proud of our team's results, putting up one of the best quarters in our history. today, we're also responding to the strength in the market and demand for industrial product, both by users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments.
i'm grateful we ended the quarter at 98.3% leased, our highest quarter on record to demonstrate the market strength, our last three quarters have produced three of the highest four quarters in our company's history. then looking at houston, we're 96.9% leased, with it representing 12.8% of our rents, down 100 basis points from 12 months ago and is further projected to fall into the low 12s later this year. there's still some unknowns about how fast and when the economy truly reopens and recovers. brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that in spite of the remaining uncertainty, we finished the quarter at $1.45 per share in ffo and can raise our 2021 forecast by $0.11 to $5.79 per share. helping balance the uncertainty and achieve these results is, thankfully, having the most diversified rent roll in our sector, with our top 10 tenants only accounting for 7.9% of rents. as we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand. based on the market strength we're seeing today, our forecast is for $210 million in 2021 starts. to position us following the pandemic, we acquired several new sites during the past two quarters, with more in our pipeline along with value-add investments. more details to follow as we close on each of these acquisitions. and to, perhaps, pre-empt a question, none of the development starts, value-add investments or land purchases are in houston.
brent will now review a variety of financial topics, including our 2021 guidance.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning. our first quarter results reflect the terrific execution of our team, strong overall performance of our portfolio and the continued success of our time-tested strategy. ffo per share for the first quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.45 per share, and compared to first quarter 2020 of $1.31 represented an increase of 10.7%. the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, particularly the quick releasing of vacated space during the quarter. from a capital perspective, during the first quarter, we issued $45 million of equity at an average price over $1.41 per share, and we closed on a $50 million senior unsecured term loan with a 4-year term at an effective fixed interest rate of 1.55%. also during the quarter, we agreed to terms on the private placement of $125 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.74% and a 10-year term that we anticipate funding in june. lastly, we retired a $41 million mortgage loan that had an interest rate of 4.75%. that activity, combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet, has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility. our debt to total market capitalization is 18%, debt-to-ebitda ratio dropped below five times, and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased to almost 8 times. our rent collections have been equally strong. we have collected 99.5% of our first quarter revenue, and we have collected $1.2 million of the $1.7 million of rent deferred last year. bad debt for the first quarter of a net positive $78,000 was the result of tenants whose balance was previously reserved, but brought current, exceeding new tenant reserves. looking forward, ffo guidance for the second quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.46 per share and $5.74 to $5.84 for the year, an $0.11 per share increase over our prior guidance. the 2021 ffo per share midpoint represents a 7.6% increase over 2020. among the notable assumption changes that comprise our revised 2021 guidance include: increasing our average month end occupancy to 96.6%, increasing the cash same-property midpoint from 4% to 4.4% and decreasing bad debt by $700,000 million to $1.1 million, which represents a forecasted year-over-year bad debt decrease of 61%. in summary, we were very pleased with our first quarter results. we will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum through the year.
now marshall will make some final comments.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brent. in closing, i'm excited about our start for the year. we're out of the gate ahead of our forecast and are still feeling that momentum in the second quarter. our company, our team and our strategy are working well as evidenced by our quarterly stats. as the economy further stabilizes, it's the future that makes me most excited for each group. our strategy has worked well the past few years. coming out of this pandemic, we foresee an acceleration in a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets. meanwhile, our bread and butter, traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last-mile distribution space and fast-growing sunbelt markets. these, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets has us optimistic about our future.
and we'll now open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from daniel santos of piper sandler. please go ahead.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on a strong quarter. so my first one is on development yields, last quarter you spoke about potentially seeing some development yield pressure. but from your results it seems like you've been able to maintain fairly consistent yields. so i guess, i would ask for some commentary there.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good morning. and thanks dan. you're right. i guess it shows my inability to predict, perhaps. but i'll compliment the team. construction prices have continued to rise and actually deliveries are continuing to get elongated. so i still expect more downward pressure on our development yields to-date. the offset the market has been so positive, as we've been able to offset that with rent growth in the markets and maintain those seven yields.
and probably especially if we look back at last year, the other kind of gratifying part of that is cap rates have come down. they've been low in the major markets within our footprint say the los angeles, dallas, atlanta, but they've continued to come down maybe another 50 to 70 basis points really across almost all of our significant markets. so our spread to develop yields to market value is probably closer to 300 basis points. at a seven -- probably almost everywhere we're developing is probably close to four and in some cases below four today in a number of cases. so i still think they'll come down. but thankfully they've got room to come down. and perhaps, there'll still be pretty profitable opportunity for eastgroup.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. that's super helpful. my next question is more of a big picture question. employers across the country have all lamented about, the labor shortage and the number of unfilled positions. but it seems like despite that tenants are still growing and taking more space. so i guess my question is, are you seeing any sort of on-the-ground impact from the labor shortage as far as taking space? or are tenants really commenting that their expansion is hindered by the labor shortage?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question. and typically the larger the tenant, the more it makes sense. the larger the labor challenges for them, or the more they think about that. i've had brokers say to me in the past, the kind of main factors are always the rent, the tenant improvement allowance the lease term. and now where do you draw your labor pool becomes part of that a bigger-and-bigger part of that equation. for us, we probably see it more and it's not given the leasing velocity that we've seen this year that has been better than we had anticipated. and feels like it's certainly continuing into the back half of the year, probably more in construction costs of getting the trades and we are seeing a rise in construction pricing and things like that. it's probably we are at -- we're getting it done but it's probably where we're feeling it the most. but it does feel like there's inflation out there. and labor will be a factor in that. but to-date it hasn't affected our leasing, you're right.
daniel santos -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's it for me. thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from emmanuel korchman of citi. please go ahead.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
hey this is chris mccurry on with manny. just a quick question on development starts. so with the increase in development starts guidance, can you just provide some commentary on funding sources, and the balance between common stock as well as dispositions and how this may impact the acquisition pipeline?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. hi. good morning. this is brent. yeah, the good news is, we have -- we view great access to capital both via issuing equity and/or the debt markets. as we disclosed this quarter, we just renewed our credit facility, increasing our total capacity from $395 million to $475 million and really pleased to have decreased our spread our rate on that by 22.5 basis points which is going to be significant over the course of each year. so from a capital standpoint, we're not constrained. the guys as they can unearth opportunities which are more and more challenging, but we have that ability. and really our dispositions are more of just good pruning from being good steward of operating our portfolio, and just kind of pruning from the bottom, but not so much as a source of capital needs.
we just don't need capital in that manner. again, we view our stock price relative to whatever you want to compute nav has is attractive. and again debt market is attractive. we're pretty much at historical lows, in terms of our debt-to-ebitda now being 4.9, and debt to total market cap in that 16% to 17% range. so very, very good shape for capital sources, for sure.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
got it. and just a quick follow-up on, can you comment on some of the markets you are focused on expanding in right now? and are some of your top-performing markets this quarter a good read-through on where you'll choose to grow?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good question chris. this is marshall. certainly some although to us i kind of think of it more -- we think really longer term of a portfolio allocation. to me, it's -- we've been working the past few years. we like houston, but kind of reducing that houston exposure. so, it's gratifying to see as we were looking back a 50 basis point drop from quarter-to-quarter down in the low 12s and that will continue dropping, but we'll still stay active in the houston market. we're under allocated out west when you look at the california markets, denver, las vegas, some of those, love to grow there. but they're really the ones we're under-allocated are also the most -- it feels like the most competitive markets.
we like miami continue to develop down there. austin, texas and dallas have been really hot markets. and we certainly have an allocation there but we'd love to keep growing in those. and i kind of view it as brent and i if we can manage the portfolio allocation and sometimes that comes from -- it's a good time to be a seller of assets so that in each of the teams in the field have that runway of when they find the right opportunity to go create value and we can execute on that. and if it requires us to sell an older asset in the market, that's a good problem to have because we -- thankfully, there's still 1,031 opportunities out there that we can recycle that capital and put it back in the development pipeline. so, i hope that's helpful. it's really more of a long-term like you think of your 401(k) allocation or something like that.
chris mccurry -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

the next question is from elvis rodriguez of bank of america. please go ahead.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning guys and great quarter. perhaps marshall you can share an update on your atlanta land acquisition? and i know you mentioned some potential opportunities to acquire more in the balance of the year. in particular, how much runway does that give you to develop in atlanta? and then also what are the markets that you're currently looking into?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure and i hope you're well. atlanta and i was just there recently and i'll compliment john coleman and our team there we are -- acquisition this quarter was really an add-on to a parcel on i-20 west that we had acquired at the end of the year that will hopefully, put to production later this year pending steel deliveries and timing of that. and then they've got a few sites tied up that we're working our way through zoning and permitting and kind of the pricing given the topography is a little more challenging at atlanta i'd say than most of texas for example or things like that. but we've got some good runway for growth in atlanta and the other nice aspect of atlanta is going back to the end of the year we had tied up three buildings on the value add that we had agreed to purchase when they were complete and we've been able -- the team has to execute all three of those are in the portfolio at 100% leased and blended yield on all three of those is probably a 6.8% 6.9%. so, taking the construction risk out the market cap rate on each of those is probably around to 4%. so, we love the value creation from there.
other markets where we're looking and it really kind of depends on where we've got land, but we've got various stages between -- a little bit of time left to close but charlotte, we're running out of land thankfully at steele creek and have some land that's been publicly announced there that the airport authority is selling. charlotte, austin as i mentioned a market, we like we've got some land parcels there. phoenix working on land dallas -- kind of each of the markets it's harder and harder and i will say the number of developers the strength in the industrial market broadly is not a well-kept secret. so, the number of active developers in our market is up pretty materially over the last couple of years. so, it's harder and harder to find those good parcels. but we've got a fair amount several hundred acres kind of tied up and working our way through diligence on those. and hopefully we'll close as many of them as makes sense as we get to the end if we can get permitting and zoning and all the things like that they take time.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks marshall for the update. and then perhaps you can maybe speak to the tenant retention in the quarter and how you look at that versus rent growth sort of like that push and pull of keeping a tenant and the revenue in the portfolio versus really pushing for that higher rent that you can probably expect from a new tenant?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure. no, good question. and typically, we -- we've been keeping a well-performing tenant long-term is where you'd rather go. and thankfully almost every tenant, i'd say high 90% have their own tenant rep broker by the time they sit down with us. and so they're aware of the market and we'll push rents. obviously, there were gap over 31%. so we've had lower tenant retention year-to-date, but we -- typically we retain about 70% of our tenants. last year, we were closer to 80%. and probably two factors have driven our retention down year-to-date as we think about it, are one, as covid hit last year, everybody understandably put their growth plans and what they were thinking on hold. and that helped us in the short term and that most tenants just stay put and didn't move. and i think now as the economy kind of stabilizes or people get comfortable operating in this environment, we are seeing tenants expand. that helped us lease.
a number of our developments have been existing tenants that have taken on more space and we've moved them from building two in a park to building eight in a park for example and things like that. and then the other thing i'll complement the team on there's been a few of our -- of the 2020 rent deferral customers that they came and they struggled through it, but given how tight the market are is as it's not as much pushing rents is improving our credit quality. so we've vacated some pretty large tenants within our buildings up 190,000 foot amazon lease that we signed in san diego in first quarter was a tenant that had struggled over the years, another one in southern california in the second quarter and we got strong releasing spreads in each of those cases, but it was also a good opportunity to move a tenant where maybe their business was struggling a little bit and put a better quality tenant.
and you saw one it's in our top 10 tenants, but it's a 3pl and it replaced a tenant who had struggled a bit over the past couple of years. so that's -- if that helps. that's really how we think about it. a great time now to improve our credit quality of our tenants. i like how diversified our portfolio is with our top 10 under -- just under 8%. and then in the meantime push rents as best we can but probably not create vacancy because i think most of the tenants know where the market is certainly by the time we finish negotiations.
elvis rodriguez -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from tom catherwood of btig. please go ahead.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, everyone. marshall, in your opening remarks, you mentioned continuing demand from e-commerce tenants and specifically last-mile delivery. we've -- it kind of feels like we've been talking about last-mile delivery in gateway cities for a while now. but with population growth in the sunbelt, it seems like there's been more attention on swifter fulfillment. where are your markets in terms of the build out of last-mile distribution facilities? and are you seeing any shifts in how your tenants are using your shallow base space for this?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes and no. i guess we certainly see it -- we've -- part of the leasing volume this year, it seems to be more and more also 3pl kind of that freight fulfillment and really last-mile delivery. i do see tenants we've seen an increase in retail-oriented tenants taking space for delivery. and as the brokers explained it to us anything that speeds up delivery, whether it's a good or a service that's where the world is going right now. so in a lot of our cases, we also have the -- it can be the train air conditioning, goodman any of those baker, the large hvac companies, the pool supply guys. so if you're in atlanta or dallas and you're i guess residential or commercial operator, this time of year if your hvac goes out, you want that delivery person this service person there quickly.
and then we do see it within e-commerce also as well as -- it's really what used to be acceptable demand was maybe three to four days, if you go back even further than that. and now it's amazon prime, amazon prime now and we really anticipate -- amazon has certainly been as we've all talked about a large consumer of space over the last call it 18 months and doesn't really feel like they're slowing down their program and we think the other retailers if our business cards were switched you've got to find ways to compete with amazon on price and delivery. so i think that's where our portfolio fits well.
and our pitch to a number of these retailers whether it's e-commerce, or delivery, or even as retail agreement curbside pickup, our buildings are efficient and close in and last mile and you're going to have to compete with amazon prime now. so it's moving in that direction and it really depends more on that retailer than it does market-by-market. yes you're right. certainly in los angeles and new york, but i don't think dallas, phoenix, atlanta or miami are very far behind. we certainly see it in miami where our project is -- our park is pretty far east compared to the competition. and when you think in south florida that basically means we're closer to the coast closer to where the high end residential is all along the atlantic.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
got it. appreciate that marshall. and then final for me. you've picked up some additional value-add properties this quarter, kind of two parts. first, when you're doing underwriting of value-add versus stabilized, what's the kind of spread in terms of yield that you're typically underwriting on these deals? and then second, are there some markets that have more opportunities for value-add than others right now? obviously, you've been active in atlanta and greenville so far. but kind of what are you seeing as far as trends in specific markets?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i guess, historically, you're looking back we would say we developed to a seven and maybe the market and now as i mentioned down to four, and then a value-add with maybe pencil out around mid-5s to 6. so you're getting maybe half is -- the spread is maybe half of what it is, but you don't carry the land go through the zoning the entitlement the construction risk everything like that, so the returns should be a little lower the teams executed well, and so we've had really strong returns almost the same as our development yields without that land carry or construction risk. the tricky part now, i think is the market the appetite is so great for industrial. what we've seen over the years we really moved to our value-add, because acquisitions lease products got so expensive. we said why don't we take on the leasing risk and we can do that and development, but i think the market is less and less afraid of vacancy. so we've seen the spreads continuing to come down on value adds.
it really depends on those developer relationships of their -- they usually have a financial partner and the model works where we'll talk to them and say, we'll buy you out at certificate of occupancy, you'll get part of your promote with your financial partner and you can move down the street and go build the next building. so that's where it's worked, and it's typically where we've been developed a relationship with that particular developer and maybe do multiple transactions. and i do think where the market is more and more of those cases, we see them listing it with one of the national brokerage groups and that's where the pricing. but it's rather than we're buying at a six and the market's four, the market is paying 4.25 in the market cap rates. that spread has gotten awfully tight because of the fear of vacancy continues to go down with this much capital and only so many places for it to go to work.
tom catherwood -- btig -- analyst
understood. thank you, marshall.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure. thanks, tom.
operator
the next question is from dave rodgers of baird. please go ahead.
nick -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. it's nick [phonetic] on for dave. i just had a question on utilization. store shelves continue to be somewhat empty and then warehouses are somewhat full just -- and import activities rising. i guess, what's the disconnect on getting products to the consumer in this market?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i guess, if i'm answering it and brent jumped in what we -- we've kind of used the phrase that demand feels like it's here today. and certainly, we've seen it with our leasing and our tenant growth and what's been a mess and it doesn't feel like it's going to get resolved anytime soon as you mentioned is getting product. there's still a backlog of ships at the ports of l.a. and long beach and with the delta variant and things like that that the supply chains are just snarled and won't be resolved anytime soon. so it's seem to be purchasing what's available not what's your choice of appliances or whatever item it is, you seem to pick.
and i think that whereas, we watch it and try to evaluate it and experience it too, it's putting stress on our development pipeline, because it takes longer for us to get this deal, which is usually -- historically made in china, but there's no capacity right now with the ships and the ports and things to get the steel to the u.s. and it's more expensive. but in the meantime, although it's taking us longer to build out our spaces, it's the same impact on all of our competition. so that's partially why our occupancy and percent leased have been so high and we think that's going to last for a few more quarters, absent some economic shutdown again, unless there's another big enough covid spike that the government shuts down the economy.
nick -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and then i guess one question, just on development. you had that build-to-suit opportunity in san diego last quarter. just commentary on -- have any tenants approached you on build-to-suit opportunities on your land bank? or what's your appetite for that?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes, good catch or good note. yes, we were happy about that and that we were planning a multi-building park and it worked for amazon for a facility there. so we're under construction. hopefully, we'll deliver it in first quarter of next year. and really we set our goal when we bought the land. we like the building design, although it's a building, rather than five or so, which we originally had planned for this site, but we are seeing more and more of that. the tenant sizes seem to be growing and we've got another one or two. you never know.
i mean it's always competitive for those pre-lease opportunities. but if we can manage the construction risk, which we have by the time we give them their bids. but if worst case, we run out of land, which is what was our goal when we acquired it and now we're looking for other sites in san diego. so we'll find that. but we had a bunch of land in atlanta or in san diego in fourth quarter and suddenly we're out. so now we're scrambling to find the next land parcel. but i hope we'll see a few more and more of those and where cap rates are, we think we're getting a great return with a long 12-plus year lease with amazon on that side.
nick -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
the next question is from michael carroll of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey. marshall, talk a little bit about the land acquisitions. and i think you mentioned this in your prepared remarks and a little bit through the q&a, that you have a number of pending transactions for potential land sites. i think you're talking about that you need to get them entitled before you close on those deals. maybe you could provide some color on what type of sites that you're looking at and the timing of those acquisitions and when could they close and how much development could they support?
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
i'm trying to be working back through that. we do -- and i'll really speak, which, i don't know, like our model. everybody's got a little bit of a different model and brent and i were both in the field, although, especially with me, it's been a minute. but where -- if you have texas, for example, you're responsible for everything in texas and that's existing portfolio, as well as finding opportunities. so we don't have a chief operating officer. we don't have a chief investment officer. so the sites may be saving a little bit of g&a.
it's really up to those teams in the field to go find the opportunities. so it's -- typically you're looking at aerials on the computer, or in the car with brokers and just turn over a lot of stones and i'll complement the team, they keep finding ways to unearth parcels. every once in a while it's a greenfield. usually it's something in this market as many developers a number -- here's a stat that surprised me recently when i was in dallas and was meeting with the cbre team that they said they were tracking maybe five years ago 20-plus active developers in the dallas market and now that number is approaching 100 for industrial.
and so that tells you how -- before we've got 20 -- call it 28 people out looking for land sites and maybe in the '90s, today how hard it is to find land, but our building footprints are smaller. and so, sometimes there's parcels work for us that may not work for a developer that's building bigger boxes and things like that, which is mostly where the new supply falls is, it's the edge of town and 0.5 million square foot in a 1 million-plus square foot building. so they keep finding them. we have -- and again, we'll see where these all shake out but several hundred acres still under contract that would close by the end of the year and then value-add as well.
and then a few -- probably another close to 100 i have to look further out into 2022 but i know there's some parcels that take longer than that. and what we'll try to do, obviously we'll tie it up as long as that seller will allow us to reduce that construction risk. ideally we -- in a lot of cases we're ready to go and put it into production as quickly as we can. but the more we can minimize any of that construction risk, zoning risk, permitting things like that getting through the cities, we think that kind of risk/reward is helpful for our shareholders. so it's -- they'll tie it up and the whole process we'll go through. and then as soon as we close ideally, we'd love to break ground the next day to minimize the carry.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's a great color.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a big part of their job brent -- sorry carroll, you've lived that world for a long time too.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. no i think that's exactly it. when we say entitlement -- in some states like texas is a little easier to migrate through the process. but in the end you're trying to make sure you've got a clear path to close meaning there's no surprises regarding zoning or improving your plans or those type things. and like i say in some markets that process is quicker like in texas and in some other markets that process takes quite a bit more time. and so one thing that behind the scenes has become more noticeable, internally maybe not externally is just the time it takes to procure land.
when you guys see it hit the supplemental schedule and you say, well you always say, it's land constrained but you're always buying sites. but i would say our lead time over the last 15 years have probably come from three to six months from tying up land and closing to 18 to 24 months and maybe the time it takes to go through the hoops or to -- if you've got a redevelopment where you're going to close a golf course or a horse race track or move someone off the size that type of thing it just takes away more time. and so that's one of the good -- it's what the public reits have an advantage over others is that you've got boots on the ground and we've got a great team in the field that can continue to make that happen and it's allowing us to create tons of nav through that platform.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so what's increasing that time frame? is it just that you're being more creative trying to find sites that could support industrial and you need to entitle it that was before maybe you're buying stuff that was already entitled for industrial as there's more competition. i mean what is increasing that time line?
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's the -- it's what's available. i mean when i moved out to houston 20 years ago i mean you literally could still pull up to the green, figure green, we say rigid day undeveloped track of land that had utilities at the street and you put out your contract, buy it, build buildings in town and the street and you went about your business. and then now, those type opportunities aren't there. so you're looking at trying to rezone a property which is trying to get -- most of the time that's down zoning, meaning it's probably a higher and better use or view higher and better than industrial, so you're trying to get it zone down to industrial.
you're trying to buy a business or two and close them and replant the land into one piece. i mean there's -- now, there's just so much other leg work that goes into getting it shovel-ready as opposed to literally just pulling out and sticking your shovel in the ground. there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work that has to go into it. it's not an easy -- it's one reason that you've seen supply not be as great some people like why aren't more people doing this? well quite frankly it's not -- the development side of the business is not an easy some of the public reits have great teams to make it look easy but it's not an easy thing to do. it would not be easy for you and i to go out and get a great track of land in a major metropolitan area and just go to town on it. i mean there's a lot of people trying to do that.
michael carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
good morning and thank you for your time. we hope everyone is enjoying their summer. i'll start by thanking our team for a great quarter. they continue performing at a high level and reaping the rewards of a very positive environment. our second quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market. some of the results the team produced include, funds from operations, coming in above guidance, up 10.5% compared to second quarter last year and $0.03 ahead of our guidance midpoint. this marks 33 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share, as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend.
our second quarter occupancy averaged 96.8%, up 20 basis points from second quarter 2020. and at quarter end, we're ahead of projections at 98.3% leased and 96.8% occupied. our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market, with accelerating e-commerce and last-mile delivery trends. quarterly releasing spreads were among the best in our history at 31.2% gaap and 16.2% cash. and year-to-date, those results are 28% gaap and 16% cash. finally, cash same-store noi rose by 5.6% for the quarter and 5.8% year-to-date. in summary, i'm proud of our team's results, putting up one of the best quarters in our history. today, we're responding to the strength in the market and demand for industrial product, both by users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments. i'm grateful, we ended the quarter at 98.3% leased, matching our highest quarter on record. to demonstrate the market strength, our last three quarters were the highest three quarterly rates in the company's history.
looking at houston, we're 96.5% leased, with it representing 12.3% of rents, down 150 basis points from a year ago and is projected to continue shrinking. brent will speak to our budget assumptions, but i'm pleased that we finished the quarter at $1.47 per share in ffo and are raising our 2021 forecast by $0.09 to $5.88 per share. helping us achieve these results is thankfully having the most diversified rent roll in our sector, with our top 10 tenants only accounting for 7.9% of rents. as we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand. based on the market strength we're seeing today, we're raising our forecasted starts to $275 million for 2021. this represents a record annual level of starts for the company. and to position us following the pandemic, we've acquired several new sites with more in our pipeline along with value-add and direct investments. more details to follow as we close on each of these opportunities.
and brent will now review a variety of financial topics, including our 2021 guidance.
brent w. wood -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, our second quarter results reflect the terrific execution of our team, strong overall performance of our portfolio, and the continued success of our time-tested strategy. ffo per share for the second quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.47 per share and compared to second quarter 2020 of $1.33, represented an increase of 10.5%. the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, particularly the quick releasing of vacated space during the quarter. from a capital perspective, during the second quarter we issued $60 million of equity at an average price over $162 per share, and we issued and sold $125 million of senior unsecured notes, with a fixed interest rate of 2.74% in a 10-year term.
in june, we amended and restated our unsecured credit facilities, which now mature july 2025. the capacity was increased from $395 million to $475 million, while the interest rate spread was reduced to 22.5 basis points, and our ongoing efforts to bolster our esg efforts we incorporated a sustainability-linked metric into the renewal. that activity combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility. our debt-to-total market capitalization was 17%, debt-to-ebitda ratio at 4.9 times, and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased to over eight times. our rent collections have been equally strong. bad debt for the first half of the year is a net positive $90,000, because of tenants whose balance was previously reserved that brought current exceeding new tenant reserves.
looking forward ffo guidance for the third quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.50 per share and $5.83 to $5.93 for the year, a $0.09 per share increase over our prior guidance. the 2021 ffo per share midpoint represents a 9.3% increase over 2020. among the notable assumption changes that comprise our revised 2021 guidance, include: increasing the cash same-property midpoint by 18% to 5.2%, increasing projected development starts by over 30% to $275 million and increasing equity issuance from $140 million to $185 million. in summary, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. we will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team, and the quality and location of our portfolio, to carry our momentum through the year.
now, marshall will make some final comments.
marshall a. loeb -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brent. in closing, i'm excited about our first half of the year. we're ahead of our forecast and are carrying that momentum into the back half of the year. our company, our team, and our strategy are working well as evidenced by our quarterly statistics, and it's the future that makes me the most excited for eastgroup. our strategy has worked the past few years, and we're seeing an acceleration, and a number of positive trends for our properties, and within our markets. meanwhile, our bread and butter traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last-mile distribution space in fast-growing sunbelt markets. these along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our market has us optimistic about the future.
and we'll now open up the call for any questions.
