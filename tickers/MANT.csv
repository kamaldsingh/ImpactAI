thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from gautam khanna of cowen and company. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. thanks, guys.
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
hi.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
judy, i was wondering if you could quantify the one -- the net one-time? was that favorable in the quarter? just so we don't overestimate as we move forward.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think some of it is one-time items and more of it is just the timing of regular items like the award fee, true-ups, some eac adjustments. so, i would say it's probably less than half of the -- the profit [inaudible] in the quarter is from one-time items, and the rest of it is just normal items that all happen to collide in the same quarter.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, what are your assumptions for h2m in terms of revenue contribution this year in the revised guidance?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
very little. they are not a big impact or swing in the 2019 performance.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. have you given any metrics on the annual revenue run rate of the acquisition?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. in terms of the $5 billion of outstanding bids, could you characterize sort of what the adjudication pipeline looks like with respect to q4 and maybe q1? are we expecting a light q4 as is seasonally the case? any color there would be helpful.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. gautam, as i think i mentioned, we have a strong amount of proposal submits this year, and it's a little bit back-ended in the second half of the year. so, proposal volume for this quarter, as well as, q4 sending it to the federal government is really heavy.
the timeline of when they have had to adjudicate that between q4 and q1 is hard for us to predict. but they're all going to be pushing between q4 and q1. so, i would suggest that it's -- it might be not going to drive any major impact in terms of growth outlook in 2020 based on the fact that that much volume is happening between q3 and q4.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and last one for me, you mentioned the recompetes pick up a bit next year. what is sort of the percentage of sales that are up for rebid? and if you could call out any kind of lumpier ones, significant ones that may carry more binary risks due to their concentration. thanks.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, there is no major recompetes. and i think, you know, we've said in the past, it looks to be 20% to 25% of our work up for recompete. i think that's moderating some, as we're starting to see even some continued extensions, but we'll have a better view on the true 2020 impact when we give guidance in february.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much, guys.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question comes from edward caso of wells fargo. your line is open.
justin donati -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, this is justin donati on for ed caso. kind of piggybacking on that, can you talk about your large deal pipeline on the new work side? any large contracts submitted that could be announced here in the near term?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
well, i -- it's kevin again. look, the flow for proposals, small and large, is heavy, and we are able to compete for larger bids more consistently now, and we're very excited about that. so, in the routine course, we do have large ones we're going after, and we'll see how successful we are in the timeline again against adjudications. but the $5 billion of proposals outstanding, reflects a strong set of opportunities to include some of the large ones that are out there.
so, i can't give you timing, but i can say it's a good healthy mix of scale within our pipeline, as well as, for submit.
justin donati -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
appreciate that. and then in your comments, you mentioned that the setup is looking pretty strong into next year. but given the really strong growth here in 2019, is there any risk of pulling forward some revenue?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
actually, i don't know what you mean by that.
justin donati -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
just on programs that started earlier, anything like that?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
no. it's kevin. there's nothing that pulled forward early. everything isn't as bad as we projected.
when we actually entered the year, we're on path for that. so, nothing is moving more quickly than expected in our current awards ramp-up or pipeline, frankly.
justin donati -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from tobey sommer of suntrust. your line is open.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. kevin, you made some comments about cr. i was curious what's in your bids or do you have any significant bids that would represent new starts and potentially be impacted by a cr, even if the cadence of awards and the activity of customers is sufficient to drive continued growth?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
you know, the cr itself, if we'd look at this year and our performance against, frankly, i'm certain, going into this year, it's been pretty strong. the underlying fy '20 and '21 budget deal is important to note, and how that cr process clears through will be important. but i do think that the majority of the work that we're going after, we're bidding on, will likely continue to be awarded. of course, there are new starts, but nothing that i would suggest would impact significantly the long-term outlook of the company.
and as you may recall, once these crs are cleared through, they still have that annual obligation to clear through, and they have to work that in years. so, that that may impact the timing of awards more than it does the likelihood of it occurring.
operator
thank you.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
yes. can i ask another question?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
oh, sorry, i wasn't sure if i had been moved on. kevin, how would you describe the company's positioning and act -- business activity around cloud and kind of the digital transformation of your customers?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, you know, we are a mission-focused company, and we help our customers migrate to future platforms to help them with their critical aspects. we're frankly excited that our customers are moving through environments, and also, that commercial companies are investing in the right level of security, cloud environments that allow our customers to use multiple [inaudible] and the cloud environments, it's going to help a lot from a speed standpoint, from an ai standpoint. so, we're frankly excited.
it's a normal part of our customers' migration. i'm going to let matt and rick provide any comment on that.
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
yeah. i'd say that as we -- from a capability's perspective, as we go into cyberspace, mission it, and analytics, how that plays into that is all part of where we're heading as a company. so, we like the overall trends that we're seeing within the market in regards to your question.
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
and i guess, i would add that our expertise in cyber uniquely positions us to work very well in that area.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
is it a -- would you say if you were to kind of parse out the elements of contracts and so forth, is, thematically, is cloud and digital transformation a meaningful part of the business now? and if not, do you expect it to be in some sort of medium-term?
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
when we look at cyber enterprise it, secured enterprise it, and mission it, all of those currently have or will have some cloud migration and cloud support activity in it. it's just based on national policy directive. so, we do expect continued movement into that environment long-term.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
if i could ask a modeling question. judy, if about 8% of the annual guidance for revenue is organic, that would make about four points or so, if my math is right, inorganic. what sort of carryover contribution from acquisitions should we be thinking about for 2020? you don't need a dollar figure, but even some sort of rough range would be helpful.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. it's very small because the kgs acquisition was completed right at the start of q2, and then, h2m as i said, is not a meaningful contributor in and of itself. obviously, we bought it for a reason, and we expect to expand within that customer set, and on the vehicles, we got with that, but it's not a meaningful inorganic component from '19 to '20.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian kinstlinger of alliance global partners. your line is open.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
hi. great. thank you so much for taking my questions.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
you added more than $900 million in new awards during the quarter. i'm curious, do you expect the majority of these programs are going to ramp in the fourth quarter? have they already begun? or will first half '20 be the stronger ramp period for you guys?
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
i think it will be a mix. most of them are starting off slowly. and so, we're working through that right now with customers, so, we probably won't have a real good sense of it for -- until probably when we do the next quarterly call.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
ok. then you mentioned, in 2019, you're expecting that you'll have submitted the same amount of proposals than in 2018 if i say that right, 2019 and 2018 will be similar. you made at least one sizable acquisition obviously, and you're growing about 8% organically. i'm curious, in order to sustain growth, should we expect submissions are going to increase in 2020, and you'll be making some significant investments there?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
well, our level of proposal pipeline is healthy. it remains healthy, and the expected amount of business that we're going to submit next year is very dependent on the customers moving forward, and executing on the timeline that they've stated or estimates are in and around that. so broadly, we see a strong set of opportunities next year that we're going to be competing on. and we think that will help us situate ourselves for 2021 for continued growth.
how much more sizable it is against this year or last year is very much dependent on the timeline that our government actually executes for these rfps.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. i guess, related to that the last question i have. i'm curious in the trends in win rates in new business opportunities have showed the recompetes in '19 versus '18 and '17. i'm curious if there has been any material change, as i'm trying to understand, based on how much you're proposing, how to think about growth going forward.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
so generally, we've been very much focused on, and i think we've mentioned this for the last few years, creating capabilities, bringing in more strong technical talent to be able to answer innovation for the customer, and provide solutions toward and using future technologies. and that has frankly paid off, and we've seen increased overall win rates. so, that just ups the game in the environment, and i can't guarantee that that win rate will sustain itself, but we think we've been doing fairly well, and that the investments have paid off. so, we're fairly pleased with the outcome so far this year.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe denardi of stifel. your line is open.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. this is jon on for joe. kevin, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the new cybersecurity effort that's been initiated by the pentagon.
can you kind of elaborate on that a little bit more? and is this an opportunity for mantech?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
well, our industry needs to support the federal government's activities to protect the supply chain and to make sure that our cybersecurity infrastructure support protection of critical data and systems because we are, at the end of the day, an extension of the federal government, on behalf of them and on that responsibility. so at a minimum, we say it's table stakes for the future if you want to do business with the government, and we're a national security company and we'll be dedicated to do the deal. on the long-term, we'll see what that does favorably for contractors. it's very much dependent on how the federal government works to execute that.
right now, it is a governance-driven activity, and we consider as something we have to meet in order to do the types of work we want to do but the customers that matter most.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. kind of pivoting over to the labor market, can you kind of talk about the trends you're seeing in the marketplace when it comes to recruitment and retention? and are you where you want to be in terms of being the destination for the technologists who can help you with the cyber and the enterprise it? if not, how are you going to get there?
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
yeah, this is rick. so obviously, the labor market is still extremely competitive for highly skilled and highly cleared people. we have put a lot of investment into the -- into our recruitment engines and it's paying off. we're having record recruiting this year.
you can see it in our dl, which is driving our revenue growth. we continue to improve our training programs. we're growing people from within. i'm very pleased on that side, and we continue to work on our retention and improve those rates as well.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent.
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
actually, rick nailed it up and down.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
very focused on this.
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
yeah.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
even judy can spell cloud now. we're in good shape.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt sharpe of morgan stanley. your line is open.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. i just wanted to talk a little bit about cash here, specifically the dso dynamic at hand. when we look at the last several quarters, obviously, you guys have done a nice job of driving that down. i think, this quarter, it was 55, and last, it was, call it, mid-60s.
traditionally, in the company, i think it's been the high 60s or 70s. is there any opportunity there to keep it at these sort of subdued levels and support cash flow? or maybe you could just peel back the layers, and just help us understand what dynamic has been driving it of late?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think, in general, we've been very focused on it. i think we've put some new processes in place with our finance teams and the customers on getting invoices approved faster, getting things built faster, and then we -- historically, we see kind of a push on the government side in q3 to make payments before the end of the government fiscal year. so, we definitely benefited from that this quarter.
so, i'm not counting on it staying at this level. i would -- it's going to be a goal, but i think probably low- to mid-60s, what we've been in the last few quarters, is probably our realistic long-term target right now.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then, maybe just one question on competition. obviously, we're a few years in here to an upcycle and the budget authority, and analysts are starting to -- at least the budget authority is starting to flatten out here a bit. has that dynamic started to change any of your sort of competitive or your peers' competitive dynamics? are you seeing a more aggressive environment at this point? it seems to me there has been a bit of an uptick in protests of late, not necessarily for you guys, but the industry as a whole.
so, i wanted to just get a sense of what you guys are seeing out there right now.
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
so i think -- this is matt. i think that from a protest perspective, we're seeing really the normal level of activity. that really just hasn't changed in this environment. i think, overall, from when you talk about the budgets and other things, our strategy is focused on the areas where the government is putting their money in growth areas.
so, we think that our strategy is well aligned to where the government is actually putting their dollars. and then -- and so, we feel like we're well-positioned for the future as we move forward.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks.
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to the mantech third-quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, stephen vather, vice president, corporate development, and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development, and investor relations
welcome, everyone. thanks for participating in mantech's third-quarter call. on today's call, we have kevin phillips, president, and ceo; judy bjornaas, executive vice president and cfo; as well as, matt tait; and rick wagner, our two group presidents. during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts, and thus, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. with that, let me hand the call over to kevin.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, everyone. i'm excited to share with you that mantech delivered another exceptional quarter. our financial results exhibited accelerating organic revenue and direct labor growth, as well as, improved profitability and robust cash flow. in q3, we also maintained our business development momentum through a series of new contract awards, as well as, retention of recompetes.
these results continue to demonstrate mantech's differentiated market position driven by our dedicated and talented employees. let me briefly provide an update on the current budget environment. we are operating under a continuing resolution through november 21st, with the potential of a cr to extend as congress negotiates the finer details of agency-level appropriations. despite operating under a cr, the enacted two-year budget deal for fy '20 and '21 provides our customers with visibility on their priorities and is allowing them to focus solely on their missions.
mantech remains well aligned with customer spending priorities, particularly in cyber, it, and systems modernization, analytics, and security and mission operations support. our strategic alignment, coupled with our differentiated and highly sought-after innovative solutions, drove $1.3 billion in contract awards in the quarter, which represents a book-to-bill of 2.2 times. contract awards drove total backlog to increase 14% year over year to a record $9.5 billion, and funded backlog grew 17% to $1.5 billion. matt and rick will provide additional details on the contract awards later in the call.
here are a few quick highlights on our bookings. first, approximately 70% of the awards in the quarter represent new work for mantech. second, 80% of the awards were for missions in enterprise it, security, and mission operations support, and cyber. and finally, nearly half of the awards came from the defense customers.
all that said, we are honored to continue working at the heart of our customers' support missions as we have for over 50 years. our customers are continuing their efforts toward procuring with speed and for innovation. within our industry, the need for color remains our key constraint. our $20 billion-plus opportunity pipeline demonstrates both mantech's strong industry position and the healthy market.
i'm pleased to see our proposal's outstanding figure grow to $5 billion even after a robust contract awards quarter. as we anticipated, proposal submissions in q3 accelerated from the first half of the year. we remain on track to have a similar proposal submission volume as what we did last year. in the quarter, we executed on our stated plan to invest in growth markets through strategic acquisitions.
we acquired h2m group, a leading provider of geospatial and imagery intelligence analysis services to nga. there is and will continue to be a strong need for data assurance, analytics, and automation to support intelligence analysts within the national security community. i'm pleased with the addition and look forward to the team developing new solutions to address the challenges of analysts across the community. before i turn the call over to judy, i want to touch on an important issue for our customers and for mantech.
security is integral to the work we do as a company and is a key operational element for our customers. over the last year, our customers have developed new policies on managing cyber and supply chain risks, and are beginning their rollout of these initiatives across the government, and the industrial base. we are committed to being a trusted partner for our customers and a partner to those who are looking to bring the best talent and technology to bear for u.s. national interests.
now, judy will discuss the detail and specifics of our financial performance and outlook. judy?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin. the results in the quarter surpassed our expectations, and then, we are pleased with the team's continued diligence. q3 revenue stood at $579 million, representing an accelerating year-over-year growth of 16%. approximately two-thirds of the growth in the quarter was organic.
direct labor was the integral component of our top-line growth. for the quarter, prime contracts represented 91% of our revenue, and contract mix was approximately 69% cost-plus, 21% fixed price, and 10% time and materials. operating income for the quarter of $38.4 million grew 31% from the third quarter of 2018. quarterly operating margin was 6.6%, a 70-basis-point improvement year over year.
margins in the quarter were primarily driven by strong fixed price contract performance, excellent award fees, and efficient management of the business, as well as, some one-time items. that said, not all of these factors are expected to impact fourth-quarter results in the same manner or degree. net income was $27.9 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 27% and 25% year over year, respectively. these increases were driven by our revenue growth and improved margins.
now looking to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. our balance sheet at quarter-end showed $33 million in cash and $25 million of debt. during the quarter, we generated an exceptional $110 million of cash from operations or 3.9 times net income. my thanks to the team and their dedicated efforts to drive dso to a record 57 days in the quarter, which represents a 10-day improvement year over year.
lastly, the board has authorized us to maintain our current quarterly dividend at $0.27 per share to be paid in december. now looking to our revised 2019 outlook. compared to our previously communicated guidance, we are narrowing the range on revenue while raising and tightening the range for net income and diluted earnings per share. we expect revenue to range between $2.19 billion and $2.21 billion, which represents 12% to 13% total growth compared to 2018.
the midpoint of our revenue guidance indicates an 8% organic growth rate year over year. we have excellent visibility for the balance of the year. the level of material procurements and ramp-up on recent contract awards are the key drivers in the variability of our revenue guidance. while it is premature to offer specific guidance on 2020 top line, our recent contract awards put us on a good path for sustained growth.
despite our strong performance in retaining recompetes and winning new businesses, we are being cautiously optimistic given the competitive nature of the market, an increased level of recompetes compared to recent years, and the potential extended duration of a cr. now moving to margins. our revised guidance implies an operating margin of 6.1% for 2019, a 30-basis-point improvement year over year. operating margins for the balance of the year reflect continued bid and proposal investments, increased program execution investments, particularly for new programs, and an increase in seasonal trends.
we are executing well ahead of plan, and achieving this new guidance would accomplish not only our targeted 2019 margin improvement at 10 basis points, but also accelerates the delivery of our 2020 goals of 15 to 25 basis points. as a result, we expect 2020 targeted margin improvement to be more gradual given the constraints of our cost-plus contract mix. we will be providing more on 2020 guidance on our q4 call. at the bottom line, we are narrowing and increasing our net income guidance range to be between $96.9 million and $97.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.41 to $2.43.
built into our guidance are a full-year effective tax rate of 25.8%, and a fully diluted share count of 40.3 million shares. now to cash flow items. our expectations for the capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for 2019 remain unchanged at 3% and 2.5% of revenue, respectively. based on the strong cash collection performance year-to-date, we are increasing our cash flow from operations estimate to be between 1.8 times and 2.1 times net income for the full year.
now matt will speak to our defense and federal civilian business.
matt tait -- president, solutions and services
thanks, judy. i am pleased to report mss had an excellent quarter. we won a number of new contract awards across our diverse customer base. within our defense business, we won three different five-year programs: first, a $322 million effort with the marine corps intelligence activity to provide mission it, cyber operations, and intelligence analysis support; second, a $132 million effort with army cecom to provide software engineering, and sustainment on the army's distributed common ground system; and lastly, we retained a recompete totaling $82 million to provide the naval air systems command with research and development, test and evaluation services to help modernize systems and sensors on uas platforms.
these contract awards demonstrate that mantech is a trusted partner supporting the core missions of our customers. in the quarter, we also enjoyed success within our federal health business through several new contract awards. we won a five-year $83 million effort to provide scientific-technical services and data analytics in support of the navy's bureau of medicine and surgery force health protection mission. additionally, we secured a $59 million full-year effort to provide it modernization, cyber, and cloud migration services to the defense health agency.
these recent contract awards exemplify how mantech's differentiated capabilities in analytics, cyber, and it modernization are being leveraged across the entire federal market. furthermore, the recent federal health awards underscore our commitment for the national security mission, which includes supporting the health and well-being of our active warfighters and veterans. rick, over to you.
rick wagner -- president, cyber & intelligence solutions
thanks, matt. i am pleased to report that mcis had a solid quarter as well. strong demand across our intelligence community customers continued to result in sole-source expansions for mantech's security and mission operations support and cyber solutions. in the quarter, we maintained our recompete retention figure through another win on a key cyber program with an intelligence community customer.
not included in our bookings, but certainly worth noting, we won a position on a $950 million multi-award idiq on the secretary of the air force concepts, development and management analytical and technical services contract. on this contract, we will provide services and solutions in the areas of mission it, advanced analytics, as well as, applied and emerging technologies to help solve complex national security challenges. earlier, kevin mentioned our recent acquisition of the h2m group. i am pleased to welcome nearly 200 highly skilled employees who joined the mantech family in august.
the integration is complete, and we are leveraging our combined customer relationships and capabilities to bring new solutions to the intelligence analytics market. moving to talent and program execution. recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent remains a core focus for us across the company. this focus goes hand-in-hand with providing our customers with the very best for mantech and ramping our recent awards quickly to deliver our innovative solutions.
i am particularly focused on accelerating the growth of our cyber talent base to meet consistent customer demand for our capabilities in this arena. our key efforts in expanding cyber talent is centered on training existing employees, as well as, building the next generation of cyber warriors through a rigorous internship program. i am pleased to report that our differentiated work in supporting national security, and our reputation for investing in employee training and development has proven successful in attracting new talent for the company. in summary, mantech's competitive market position is a clear result of prioritizing customers and their critical missions, delivering innovative and reliable solutions, and investing in the development of our employees.
we look forward to continued execution of our growth-focused strategy. and with that, we are ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from gautam khanna of cowen and company. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thanks. good afternoon guys.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
hey. hello.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
hey.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
just a couple of questions on the guidance first. i was wondering if you could frame the implied organic growth in the sales guidance. and then relatedly, on the new presentation of earnings, adjusted earnings, what level of intangibles amortization specifically is contemplated in that -- was excluded from that number, just so we can compare apples to apples.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
yeah. so the first question, on an organic basis, it is -- we did one acquisition at the end of q1, and we did one acquisition in mid-q3, and they were both relatively small. so the total inorganic growth from '19 to '20 is about 1% or so. and then as far as the intangible, in 2019, it was about $20 million of the intangibles that you can see in the press release.
and we think it's going to be relatively similar to that in 2021.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. so it's about $0.40 or so. was that what the rough math would work out to be?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
yeah.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
or thereabouts?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
yeah.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then on the $920 million contract win, could you talk a little bit about -- could you say anything about it? is it cost plus? is it time -- sort of the margin profile? and how quickly it might ramp in 2020, sort of what that contribution is or what the transition is to ramp up the program?
matt tait -- president, mission solutions & services
sure. gautam, it's matt. so the one thing that we can say about the contract is similar to our other large contracts, we expect this to ramp over an 18- to 24-month period. so that's the expectation there.
it's about all i can answer on your question there. so hopefully that helps.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then may i ask a different one then. perhaps on -- was it a greenfield project or was it -- was there an incumbent? and therefore, might there be a protest and might there be an extended transition to that 18 to 24 months?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. kevin. look, we're near the end of the evaluation award, and then protest period on that which is why we're communicating it. it could be protested.
to our knowledge, it has not been yet. but we're in a time line where it's important for us to communicate to you this award given its size. so it's possible. to our knowledge, it has not yet been protested.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
and is it new, new work to the industry or is it -- was there an incumbent?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it is. there is. for the most part, this is mostly new work for us.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much guys.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development, and investor relations
thanks gautam.

our next question comes from edward caso of wells fargo. your line is open.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey good evening. congrats on a nice print year. curious, kevin, on your thoughts on the timing of the budget decision for '21 given the election. i've heard some say early, some say cr until after.
just curious your thoughts.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
so my view is the authorization process will work in, call it, regular order. the appropriations process though may get hung up into a cr after the election simply because of the timing of decisions around funding. it could move earlier but my general view is authorization will move quickly, appropriations may be delayed.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
can you talk a little bit about employee attrition here, voluntary attrition?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's been running fairly consistently for the last two years. it's important for us. we spend a lot of time and energy on that. i would say that the market continues to be very robust for talent.
we are all working toward two things within the company, investing and retraining individuals into these future careers. and that's going in the market, making sure that we provide competitive packages to attract the talent.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
can you remind us how much percent of total you have of your employee base in the greater d.c. area and how much outside? and if you could make that attrition comment for that -- those two geographies?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
i don't have the two geographies in my head. a little over half of our employee base is in the region. and yeah, i think it's competitive everywhere. it's a matter of our customers' ability and willingness to distribute the workforce based on where people want to work and live and there's an active discussion that has happened with the industry and our customers on that.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks ed.

our next question comes from joseph denardi of stifel. your line is open.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. hey good evening. kevin, i think the growth rate that you guys are generating continues to surprise the investment community, but maybe it's not surprising you all, but certainly surprising us. can you talk about what you think is driving that? is it better win rates? is it alignment? there's just more coming to market? and then when you look at what you expect to bid on this year, assuming you win kind of your fair share, does that sustain the growth rate kind of continuing into 2021 or just does the budget environment start to moderate growth? thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
that's a lot of questions. so i'll make sure i can unwrap that. the 2020 -- the fy '20 and '21 budgets that got cleared through, in my view, allow us all a pathway into a two-year budget cycle. and i think the customers have fair certainty for '20 around what they need to procure, and they're procuring in a regular, if not, rapid pace depending on the type of work.
customers are looking more for speed, they're looking for innovation, and those are areas that we've been focused on because we generally view the global threat environment as driving different behaviors in the customer. we're investing toward where we think that and have been toward where that's headed. and i think that, along with the capabilities that we have around cyber, it, some of the analytics capabilities and intelligence operations support provide us a good placement in the market at a point where there's a greater demand.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and then, it's kind of -- to date, within the government fiscal year, are you seeing customer behavior, procurement activity accelerate, slowdown? and what's your expectation for what the election cycle means for their procurement environment? thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
procurement activity is heavy. timing of awards is uncertainty, but procurement activity's heaviness is expected to be at or above last year's levels.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from tobey sommer of suntrust. your line is open.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. i wanted to ask a question about contract type. are there any changes in your mix of new wins or maybe in your backlog or pipeline that could inform what the future margin profile of the firm looks like?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
yeah. i mean, to date, we haven't seen in either our backlog or the wins a significant shift. we do continue to hear discussions around moving toward more solution based contracting which i think is helping on the margin side and seeing a little bit more movements on potentially the dod side to move toward a little more fixed price. but to date, that has not flowed through all the way to the backlog and performance.
matt tait -- president, mission solutions & services
yeah. i think what we're also seeing in the market as well, customers they want to have more of a value based and outcome based and, what we prefer, a solution based conversation. so all of those things are kind of happening, but that's separate from the type of contract. so it's almost two different conversations that you're having out there in the market as we move forward.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you.
rick wagner -- president, mission, cyber & intelligence solutions
this is rick. i can tell you, i mean, we're beginning to see them look at this, especially in the it side, look at more outcome based contracting. but it's a contract by contract type of thing, and they're not moving quickly.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
that's helpful that there are multiple vectors to think about there. and when you think about your new business win rate, what has that been like and does it convey to you that you should bid more or you're bidding their amount? kind of what's the takeaway from the win rate from your perspective?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
it's kevin. look, we're pleased with our overall win rate, both recompete and new. we don't give the specific numbers, but we're pleased. we have been investing heavily in solutioning and proposal activity and an ability to compete on a broader scale against these efforts.
and so i'm happy with what we have. i think we're in a strong position to compete. it's a very competitive market. we'll see how it plays out.
but generally, we're winning our fair share. we're doing a lot of solutioning to differentiate ourselves and we think that that's paying dividends.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
asked in a different way, are you -- is your growth in dd, is that growing at about the rate of the company in your guidance for this year or is there a difference?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
the proposal volume is over $20 billion. our investments are higher because we feel that we can afford to do that. we're directing the money, and we're going to continue to focus on that to expand our top line.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
last question for me. you mentioned several areas of the president's budget request. what are sort of the top two areas of spending growth in that request would the company plays and you stand to benefit the most?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
look, if you think about the use of cyber and automation, you can call it ai, ml, whatever advancement to work to speed to decision making. those are areas that companies like mantech can differentiate ourselves and need to make sure there's a greater security around data and systems will also continue to be growth. the areas that we don't play that have increased or like hypersonics, right, the major new developed systems that they're building to compete more globally for new weapon systems.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gautam khanna of cowen. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey. sorry to keep asking questions. i thought it was worth asking though the $6 billion-plus of outstanding bids, is that net of the $920 million win?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
it's a q4 number that had it included in it.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and so it's subsequently been awarded. i was curious, what do you anticipate the profile of contract awards will be by quarter this year? do you have a sense for -- obviously, q1, by definition is going to be strong given this win, but are you also seeing a lot of other awards come through in q1? and maybe if you could speak to just the pacing of adjudications.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
it's really hard -- it's hard to speak to pacing. we can speak to when they're requesting submittals. but timing of their evaluation and the following award, that is not something we can provide consistency on or visibility into.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. is it worse than before or is it kind of the same in terms of -- are things moving out or it stays the same?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
it's the same. yes, in the last few years, you've seen more certainty around the budget and there's more activity, but i think it's a consistent pattern now and totally depends on the procurement shop is what delays the time lines.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. and then on the m&a pipeline, can you speak to what you're seeing? are there promising targets in the pipeline? and if so, any sense for the scale of the opportunities, midsized candidates, larger ones? what would it be kind of?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
yeah. i mean, i'll start and then any of the other gentlemen here with me can chime in. there is a very active pipeline of opportunities. the m&a market is very active right now with all sizes of opportunities from the typical tuck-ins that we tend to do around $50 million to $100 million, up to some larger properties.
so we're continuing to look. we're very focused on maintaining our disciplined strategy that kevin talked about with looking at capabilities and customer sets, and still trying to maintain our pricing discipline in an expensive market.
matt tait -- president, mission solutions & services
and i would say that we're also focused on capabilities and customers as part of our overall m&a strategy. and that's important, that will maintain our discipline as we continue forward.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. and to that last point, any thoughts to -- i mean, is there any greater emphasis put on non-dod, non-intel, traditional federal civilian agencies or expanding kind of the pie for what traditionally has been mantech from our view has traditionally been mantech's core?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's kevin. broadly, we think as dhs is sort of equal national security and home security demand and need as dod. and so we are continuing to focus on there.
we also continue to focus on the overall healthcare component for our veterans as well as our active duty, and we'll selectively look into other federal civilian agencies based on their mission requirements.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. thanks a lot guys.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from joseph denardi of stifel. your line is open.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, thanks. just one more. kevin, you mentioned the two-year budget agreements providing a good kind of backdrop for you all. does that apply to your 2019 and 2020 or does that more benefit than a 2020 and 2021 for you? thank you.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
well, 2019 was based on the prior two years i think '20 and '21 is what we're looking at. and i think that's the year budget deal will allow for the mission requirements and the proposal volumes to continue for next 12 to 18 months. and we'll see what happens later on based on election cycles and requirements.

good day ladies and gentlemen. and welcome to the mantech fourth-quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. stephen vather, vice president, corporate development, and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development, and investor relations
welcome everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's fourth-quarter call. on today's call, we have kevin phillips, president and ceo; judy bjornaas, executive vice president and cfo; as well as matt tait and rick wagner, our two group presidents. during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts, and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. finally, on today's call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors.
these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our fourth-quarter earnings release. with that, let me hand the call over to kevin. 
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon everyone. i'm excited to discuss our outstanding 2019 results driven by mantech's differentiated market position. we enjoyed another consecutive year of strong and consistent financial performance. for the year organic revenue growth accelerated to 9%, ebitda grew 17% and ebitda margins expanded 30 basis points.
we collected $221 million in cash from operations and our book-to-bill stood at 1.3 times placing us on an excellent path for continued growth. i want to thank our talented employees whose steadfast support to our customers and their missions resulted in this excellent performance. overall, i am pleased that we are consistently executing and that our growth-focused strategy is maximizing value across all of our constituents, those being our customers, employees and shareholders. mantech was successful in securing new contract awards throughout 2019 across defense, intelligence and federal civilian customers.
in q4, we won $413 million of contract awards, resulting in a 0.7 times book-to-bill. in the year, we won a total of $2.9 billion in contract awards, a 1.3 times book-to-bill which provides a solid foundation for continued growth in 2020 and beyond. new business made up approximately 50% of 2019 awards. we exited the year with a total backlog of over $9 billion, up 9%.
our business development success was evident across our customer base and our key capabilities in systems engineering, cyber, it and intelligence operation support. nearly a third of our bookings were on a sole-source basis which, coupled with our competitive wins, clearly indicates mantech's customer recognized differentiation. we enjoyed a healthy level of proposal submits in 2019, and are on a path to have another busy year on that front. our qualified pipeline remains well in excess of $20 billion, and our proposals outstanding sits at over $6 billion.
our customers' appetite remains strong for mantech's innovative solutions. as a result, we are projecting strong growth in 2020. additionally, we recently won a $920 million single-award contract. this award, combined with our strong bookings in 2019 as well as our healthy pipeline, offers us a solid growth -- trajectory for growth.
mantech will speak to additional details on this award later in the call. now shifting briefly to customer budgets in the market environment. all of our customers are operating under incorporations enacted in december. with clear funding levels, customers remain focused on speed and innovation of solutions against critical mission requirements.
last week, the president released his fy '21 budget request which calls for $705 billion for defense and maintains the spending level set in the fy '20 appropriations. the request calls increased funding in cyber, systems modernization, space, autonomy and artificial intelligence, all areas where mantech is strategically aligned and well positioned to deliver innovative solutions. there continues to be strong, broad bipartisan awareness of the threat environment facing the nation and the required funding to address them. lastly, government wide, there is a continued focus on security that is driving policy and actions to defend against threats in the cyber domain as well as in the supply chain.
i'm incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished and look forward to maintaining our success. i'm thankful for our customers for trusting us and our people on delivering success on all fronts. continued customer appetite for mantech's innovation and solutions is clear. as such, we remain focused on strategically investing in talent and capabilities to preserve and sharpen our competitive advantage.
now, judy will walk through the details of our 2019 financial performance and 2020 outlook. judy?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and cfo
thanks kevin. i'm pleased to report our strong finish to the year. our results exceeded the high end of our expectations across the board. revenue for the year was $2.2 billion, up 13% and 9% organically.
this growth was primarily driven by new contract wins both on existing programs and our strategic acquisitions. for the fourth quarter, revenue was $604 million, up 22% and 15% on an organic basis. strong direct labor growth was evident in both the quarter and the full-year results. lastly, in the quarter, we enjoyed strong contribution from fulsome ramp-ups of our recent contract awards and an uptick in odcs.
for the year, we performed 90% of our work as a prime and our contract mix was approximately 70% cost plus, 20% fixed price and 10% time and materials. ebitda for the quarter was $55 million for an ebitda margin of 9%. for the year, ebitda was $194 million, up 17%. ebitda margin for the year was 8.7%, up 30 basis points from 2018, exceeding our expectations and more than accomplishing our targeted incremental margin improvement.
net income was $41 million and diluted eps was $1 per share in q4. for the full year, net income was $114 million, and diluted eps was $2.83. net income and eps for the quarter and the full year were both up meaningfully compared to the respective 2018 period as a result of two primary factors, strong operational performance and a discrete tax-related pickup. in q4, we recorded a reduction to our income tax expense of approximately $12 million resulting from the reassessment of current and prior-year's research and development tax credit.
excluding the impact of the r&d tax credit, we had an effective tax rate of 23.7% in q4 and 25.1% for the full year. adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps which excludes discrete tax items as well as the impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, also demonstrated healthy growth. adjusted net income was $33 million and adjusted diluted eps was $0.81, up 39% and 37% respectively. for the year, adjusted net income was $117 million, and adjusted diluted eps was $2.91, up 19% and 18%, respectively.
now on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. for the year, we collected $221 million in cash flow from operations, a robust 1.9 times net income. dso was 59 days at year-end, a 14-day improvement from last year. we distributed $43 million in dividends for the year, maintaining a steady return of cash to shareholders.
at year-end, we had $9 million in cash and $37 million of debt. given the strength of our balance sheet and expected cash flows, the board has authorized us to raise our quarterly dividend by $0.05 a share to $0.32, a 19% increase from current levels. this dividend will be paid in march and equates to an annualized dividend of $1.28 or a yield of approximately 1.6%. now on to our 2020 guidance.
we expect revenue to be between $2.375 billion and $2.475 billion. adjusted net income between $126.2 million and $132.4 million and adjusted diluted eps between $3.08 and $3.23. the midpoint of the revenue range implies 9% growth and more than 80% of our guidance is expected to come from current backlog with the balance from recompetes and new business. our contract awards from 2019, coupled with our year-to-date 2020 wins including the large award kevin mentioned earlier, provides us with a clear path to growth.
turning to margins. our guidance assumes an ebitda margin of 8.7% for the year which is flat from the prior year given the significant margin improvement delivered in 2019. we remain focused on driving top-line growth and we'll continue to invest in innovation, bd and talent development to capitalize on the near-term market opportunity. built into our guidance are an effective tax rate of 23.8% and a fully diluted share count of 41 million shares.
cash flow from operations should be at least $150 million for the year. we expect capital expenditures of approximately 3% of revenue, with quarterly variability being driven by actual program requirements. longer term, we expect capital expenditures to trend lower to more normalized levels. now, matt will speak to our defense and federal civilian business.
matt tait -- president, mission solutions & services
thank you judy. i am pleased with mantech's mission solutions and services performance in 2019 and look forward to driving the team to another successful year. throughout the year, we enjoyed success in securing both new business and recompetes. in the quarter, we successfully retained a $67 million, five-year recompete, providing scientific and technical support for the marine corps systems command.
overall, i am pleased with the performance in the year, and carrying forward our momentum in 2020 is a key objective. as such, we have a sharp focus on driving innovation ahead of customer demand and ensuring program delivery excellence. before i turn the call over to rick, i want to note that we have been awarded a five-year $920 million contract by feds. even though this contract award is not in our q4 bookings or backlog, given the size of the award, we wanted to make you all aware.
the government is currently reviewing the press release and specifics about the program, and the objective of the contract will be detailed in a forthcoming press release upon formal approval. rick, over to you.
rick wagner -- president, mission, cyber & intelligence solutions
thanks matt. mantech mission, cyber and intelligence solutions enjoyed a stellar 2019, particularly in driving growth, retaining recompetes and hiring differentiated talent. in quarter 4, we successfully delivered full operating capability on our large dod enterprise it program and fully ramped other contract awards won earlier in the year, keeping our commitments to provide the very best to our customers. we enjoyed the continuation of a number of favorable trends in 2019.
there are two in particular that i would like to call to your attention. first, over half of our contract awards came on a sole-source basis. and second, we saw increased customer demand on existing programs in the form of significant contract expansions and extensions. the extensions helped reduce our 2020 recompete risk within our intelligence community customer stat.
both of these trends further prove our differentiation and the value that customers find in our solutions. as we look to the rest of 2020, we will continue to focus on both our customers and our people. for our customers, we remain focused on developing and delivering innovation, coupled with strong program execution. on the people front, we have a steadfast focus on growth through recruiting, developing and retaining highly skilled and differentiated talent.
with that, let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks rick. in closing, let me reiterate that we are very pleased with our 2019 performance, and i want to leave you with three key messages before we jump into questions. first, the work that mantech performs is very much at the heart of our customers' mission, and we are thankful for their steadfast trust in us. second, our talented employees are the source of our differentiation and as such, growing and developing them has been and will continue to be a key management priority.
finally, mantech's unique growth story remains very much intact, and our confidence is rooted in the strength of our talented people, deep customer relationships and differentiated capabilities. with that, we are ready to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from edward caso with wells fargo. please go ahead.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks. congrats on the nice print. i understand  thank you.
can you hear me?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we can.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. i'm trying to understand the 3610, section 3610 process here. how much of it is normal business? and how much are you going to have to ask for equitable adjustments down the road? that would -- that's my first question.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so on the services side, the vast majority of it is going to be business as usual for any amount of time after the 27th of march where our people were moved into a mission-ready state. there's a couple-of-week period before that where a little bit -- maybe one and a half months, depending on the customer set in the region, where people may have started moving into a different mission-ready state on an interim basis. for that portion of it, there may be some rea requirements.
but the vast majority of it, we will be able to bill on a regular cycle the cost for the period that they're in a mission-ready state. does that answer your question?
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. that's great. thank you.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i was just going to add, ed, that i think, again, because most of our work is in the cost-plus basis at the process for us will be relatively painless to bill and recover that covid cost. i think if you have fixed-price contracts that were impacted, that's going to be a little more difficult, and we'll probably require the reas.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok, great. just a simple one here. on the $1.1 billion in awards, is all the $920 million in that number?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
sorry. you were breaking up a little bit. could you say that again?
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i'm sorry. how much of the large $900-plus-million contract is in this quarter's awards?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
the full amount is in q1.
edward caso -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian kinstlinger with alliance global.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. thanks so much. if i take the run rate of your first-quarter revenue, you're already at the high end of your guidance range. so i wonder, are you expecting fewer pass-throughs? i think you maybe talked about lower revenue maybe from programs where teleworking is not possible.
or is it more as projects and programs like your $920 million contract will be delayed in ramping given the current situation?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think it's a combination of those things, brian. i think the bigger impact is for new business to delay. and then while we've seen good hiring to date, clearly, it's a little bit harder to get people ramped up on new contracts, so there could be some delays there and then just the usual timing of material pass-throughs.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up would be you talked about the procurement cycle. are you seeing procurements get canceled, where the customer says we're going to do a one-year bridge as it will be easier in this time to stick with our incumbent? i'm just wondering if that's a trend that's starting to materialize at all.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
brian, it's kevin. it's very much dependent on the customer. i would say that the proposal volume and request within the vast majority of our business is continuing. if there are delays, it's more incremental.
so we're not seeing -- if anything, we're seeing them continuing to push very aggressively on a procurement process on awards with some incremental delays just based on the availability of people based on working remotely. i would say the exception to that is in the intelligence community where people physically have to be on site to be able to access the data. from the customer side, that is going to create some delays, and there might be some extensions as a result, but it's too early to tell.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from gautam khanna with cowen. please go ahead. gautam, please check your mute button.
all right. i'm going to move to the next question from robert spingarn with credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. good numbers. i wanted to ask you, kevin, you alluded or maybe somebody else alluded to some changes coming here in the early part of the second quarter. i was wondering if we could just dig a little deeper into that, how things are maybe slowing or changing as you move from q1 to q2.
and then i have another question after that.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so on the proposal volume, again, the proposal volume is very high. the timing of awards might be delayed, except for the intelligence community, where the proposal volume might slow down because the physical on presence need to do the type of work needed to continue these procurements. and generally, a vast majority of contracting officers have to get the near-term actions done to get the covid-related charging all set up on their programs, and that could create a delay, so that's about it.
except for the people who are working in a part-time state and some of those folks, they gradually start going back full time to work, and that's kind of the timing phase-up that judy has built into guidance.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then just on the logistics of this, you mentioned before, obviously, some of your people are teleworking, and then some need to be on site. is there a way to quantify? is there a pie that we can chop up here in terms of who's eligible to telework? and then on the back of that, do you see some cost savings down the road here if, as someone said earlier, you're able to continue to do the work remotely in the future? is there a real estate footprint opportunity or anything else that might -- that benefit you in the future?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
so at very high level, i'll talk about exception, not norm. less than 20% of our workforce is basically in a position where they may not be -- just based on the access restrictions, whether that's travel or clearances, may not be able to work full time. out of that, i'd say many of those are actually working full time because of the type of work and accommodations. everybody beyond that is working teleworkers.
within that, we have a number of -- a group of people who are either working full time within that 20% or 30 hours a week or 20 hours a week or 10 hours a week, and those are the new baselines from which they're going to start gradually ramping back up. so it's hard to give you a headcount equivalent because it's variable. but generally, less than 20% of our workforce is in some mission-ready state for some part of their time. i hope that's helpful.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then just on the cost side, in the future, the permanence of this.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll let rick speak to some of the activities you're seeing in his customer set. it's hard for us to know whether it's permanent just based on the variability of this. but rick?
rick wagner -- president, mission, cyber and intelligence solutions group
yes, kevin. so typically, the intelligence community does a lot of their work within scarce and special spaces. being able to do teleworking really creates some opportunity for us on the side of being able to hire people at different clearance levels. i don't think you'll see like big real estate reductions or things of that nature around it.
it will just -- it will make it more efficient to do the work and could help relieve a little bit of the pressure on hiring.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from tobey sommer with suntrust.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. what changes in federal spending priorities do you anticipate at this juncture with incomplete information acknowledge that? and how do you plan on positioning the company against what could be shifting priorities, certainly as it relates to the public health?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll speak to two parts. and then on the federal health side, i'll let matt end on this. so generally, we see the fy '20 budget to be a good harbinger budget -- '21 budget, as well because those two-year plans are already in place.
there might be some timing as to when congress can get to the '21 budget. if they aren't seeing anything that would say there's a redirect on the '21 budget, it's more of an additive set of requirements in response to covid based on the emergency bills. long term, i think that the -- it's hard to tell, but i would say that you can tell the discretionary budget within the federal government has a high demand. and sometimes when it may not be invested in, at a point in time when there's an emergency, you can see where that is.
so we'll have to see how this all plays out, just like we do for any emergency or any investment that the government has to make because they have to make hard choices as to how they need to redirect. but i would just reinforce that these events are an example when the discretionary budget that drives the decision to react at capacity to the federal government basically show the importance of it. matt, do you want to speak to the federal health side?
matt tait -- president, mission solutions and services group
yes. i mean, on the federal health side, i think this is part of the reason why we have been focused on that aspect of the business, tobey, is we've always seen that that's going to be a need from a national security mission set perspective. so we actually are -- we feel well-positioned for where that's going to be going from a priorities perspective.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and could you elaborate on the...
matt tait -- president, mission solutions and services group
am i the only one that lost tobey? [technical difficulty]
operator
and our next question...
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
can you hear me?
operator
tobey, please continue.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
oh, yeah. if i could -- thank you. sorry about that. i was going to ask about a penchant i perceive between two comments.
one was an increased near-term investment in infrastructure and some degree of like kind of hopeful optimism that, longer term, this may change the way your customers and your own staff deliver services.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
so it's kevin. i'll speak to that. there are needs for distributed environments for classified work, and that's where our investments are going. there may be a potential or a shift in work toward an unclassified portion of that over time that will allow for more work to be done outside of a secured facility.
so both are in play right now that we have to deal with. one is supporting the necessary distribution of secured facilities, and the other is to allow or accommodate for a non-classified portion of work, so we can help scale that workforce as well. so it's not necessarily conflicting. it's complementary if it works to it.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
understood. are those discussions for sort of a portion of unclassified work being done? is that being conducted at the highest levels within the customers and with political support?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
those are certainly discussions that have been going on for some time. i think you will see, as part of this process, that we will ramp that up and try to work to get more.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from mariana perez mora with bank of america. please go ahead.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. so on our defense it services contractor mentioned a dramatic increase in our space since the beginning of march. could you comment and give us some color on the rfp and award environment you are experiencing during the pandemic?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
so award environment, i'll speak to the proposal volume and award environment both, and then you can follow on if i missed anything. so we have seen a significant amount of proposal requirements in the first quarter. it was very heavy, and that's reflected in our proposals outstanding. we have seen, i would say, a little bit less than average adjudication but not much, but as a company, we want a higher portion of those adjudications that came through.
so we're not really seeing a slowdown or any requirement, except for those where the governments physically cannot get in to do their job. so the demand signal is still there, but we see this as a labor workforce issue, more than an opportunity issue still, which is why we're continuing to focus on how to get the right talent speed to meet the...
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect. and then can you also give me some color on any benefits that the department of defense has given to you? because there has been a lot in the news about the accelerated progress payments and other benefits under the cares act, but it's less clear how the services are being benefited from those.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so first of all, i think that we, as an industry, are very grateful to the government for recognizing the need for this industrial base. and the congress, the executive branch, the services and agencies, departments have all moved at a very quick speed to be responsive to this crisis, and so we are recognizing that. the dod and the agencies have tried to work toward accommodating an ability to push payments earlier to streamline payment processes were potentially doable to streamline award decisions because they know they have a lot of other things to do related to the covid crisis itself.
so for us, specifically in our industry, i would say that they are more focused on protecting the workforce, maintaining the cash flow reasonably, not in advance, because most of our work doesn't require advanced payments but a reasonable cash flow. and we are making sure that we flow that down to our industrial base and subcontractors as well because it's very important that it gets to them.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from louie dipalma with william blair. please go ahead.
louie dipalma -- william blair and company -- analyst
kevin, judy and stephen, thank you for taking my questions. so there has been a lot of m&a in this government it services space over the last three years and even the prior three months before the pandemic. some of your peers have made scale deals, and others have made product deals. i was wondering, do you feel any need to increase mantech's scale to counter the increased scale and the increased product capabilities of some of your competitors? you have obviously done well with your strategy of small tuck-in acquisitions.
mantech's stock price has increased by more in 2020 than any of its peers, but at the same time, i was just wondering if you feel any need to react to your competitors on the m&a front.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so from an m&a standpoint, we maintain the same posture that, first of all, we want to prioritize m&a for our use of cash, but we also want to be selective because at our size and how the government procures, there are more than enough, i'd say, white space areas and capabilities that we can invest in and go after $100 million plus procurement as a prime contractor and grow our business. we have not, as a company, seen a path or a need to diversify into product or to work toward scale. there are some bids at the enterprise it level that may restrict us in the future based on the size of those, but they may not.
so the answer -- short answer is no. longer answer is we thought it through, and we think we're in a good position.
louie dipalma -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. and another one for me. last year, you indicated that you intended to submit $10 billion in bids for calendar 2019. can you provide the amount that you intend to submit for this year?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
we expect the current year proposal volume to meet that number if not extend it.
louie dipalma -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and final one. last quarter, you indicated that your pipeline was greater than $20 billion. is it still approximately at that level, even though you have $7 billion in bids outstanding?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's consistent in terms of its outlook, yes.
louie dipalma -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is from robert spingarn with credit suisse.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
i wanted to ask you a couple more things, kevin. just going -- finally on to tobey's question about redirect and what i think was really looking forward to the risk of a period of budget austerity as other priorities surface here related to the covid crisis. how do you avoid what happened a decade ago, just being surprised on the downside? and i understand that was industrywide, and it was a different set of circumstances. we were exiting a war, and we had a new president that had a different view.
but how do you protect yourself against the downside here? and does it take a change in administration for this to happen, or could we have it with the same administration?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
and so i would say that we're much more diverse in our customer set than we were then. our job is to support customer missions when they go up and support our customers when those missions go down as well. that said, we have a much broader customer set, a much broader set of capabilities. our general view is that the mission-enabling needs of the technology transformation under way today may stay the same or expand, if you think about all the activities going on around needing distributed environments for communications.
so we will have to see how the federal budgets play out, but i would say that we're in a much better position from a risk mitigation standpoint based on the distribution of our customers, the distribution of work and the broad backlog we have as well.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
and i think this got touched on earlier, but i figured i'd try to delve in a little bit deeper. have you seen any early opportunities building here out of the federal government in a post pandemic effort to prepare for next time, the next pandemic, things that you could participate in given that, i think, that you bring a lot of skill sets that might be applicable in such an effort?
matt tait -- president, mission solutions and services group
yes. so this is matt. yes, we actually are seeing opportunities and actually are supporting certain aspects of this current pandemic, so i think that's definitely an area of opportunity that we are already acting on.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from joe denardi with stifel.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. this is jon on for joe. kevin, we were just kind of curious. you have previously talked that 2020 would be kind of the usual year in term of recompetes.
are you still thinking that? and what's the customer telling you in regards to some of these recompetes? are they concerned around the risks? or are they thinking maybe that they can perhaps extend this work and push it out into 2021? if you can give some more color on that, that would be great.
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. jon, this is judy. i'll give it a first crack and then if matt or rick want to chime in about their business areas. but in general, we have seen some of the risks go down over the last two quarters, especially in the intel space, where they have done exactly what you've mentioned and done a number of multiyear sole-source extensions.
we still have, on the books, a number of recompetes in the second half of the year. but right now, about 90% -- a little more than 90% of the midpoint of our guidance is already in backlog. and i think, just as we said, there could be slippages from some of the new business that we were looking at. it's quite possible that there could be delays on recompetes as the government gets their feet back under them and respond kind of post pandemic and gets back to business as usual.
i don't think it would surprise us tremendously. but i don't know. matt, you've got quite a bit of the recompete that's left. what are your customers saying about that?
matt tait -- president, mission solutions and services group
yes. i think it's a mix, right? i mean, like kevin kind of alluded to, right, there are some things that are moving in the past that where we, i'll say, normal course, but then there are certain areas where we're seeing a delay in terms of adjudications. and i think that just kind of leads to more revenue assurance.
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
awesome. and then just kind of a follow-up here. when you're looking out at the current covid-19 environment, specific to protest, are you seeing any change in companies protesting and then delays there from the gao? or has everybody kind of reset expectations around protesting? and are we thinking that approach? if you guys can give any color there, that would be awesome. appreciate it.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
no change in protest processes, timing [inaudible]
jon ladewig -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question is from tobey sommer with suntrust.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. so i wanted to ask a follow-up question. with respect to the potential for intelligence customers to sort of disaggregate and have some non-classified work done before the classified piece finishes off, what are the positive potential outcomes of that for the company and industry? and what are the risks, including potential margin risk, if part of it doesn't require clearances?
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think any movement we see in that direction will be minimal, clearly, to start. in my view, it would take a long time for the intelligence community to change that model and to do a lot of work on classified. so i think that -- i think the risk part is fairly small.
and as i said before, i think the opportunity side is really on the ability to bring people into the intelligence community, first in an unclassified manner, and then upgrade their clearances and move them into the full capacity. and so that's the most promising thing that i see.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to the mantech first-quarter fiscal-year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the call over to stephen vather, vice president, corporate development, and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development, and investor relations
welcome, everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's first-quarter call. we hope that everyone is healthy and remaining safe during these uncertain times. we are practicing good social distancing, and as such, we are utilizing a completely virtual approach to our earnings call this afternoon.
please bear with us if you experience any minor delays or mixed audio quality on the call. joining me on today's call, we have kevin phillips, president and ceo; judy bjornaas, executive vice president and cfo; as well as matt tait and rick wagner, our two group presidents. during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts, and thus, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.
for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. note, covid-19 has been included as a risk as it is uncertain what the potential impact could be to our business, and therefore, it could cause our future results to be different than our current estimate. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. on today's call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors.
these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our first-quarter earnings release. following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over to your questions. we recognize there may be many questions.
please limit yourself to one question. and if you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue. with that, let me hand the call over to kevin. 
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, stephen, and good afternoon, everyone. i'd like to begin the call by discussing the covid-19 pandemic, its impact and how we are managing our business through this national emergency. after that, i will offer an update on mantech's quarterly performance, followed by some thoughts on the broader market and the environment. first, i want to express our deepest gratitude to the healthcare professionals, first responders, government officials, members of the military and national guard and many others that are on the front lines of battling this pandemic.
over the last few months, the world has seen unprecedented events. and as you can imagine, the health crisis has become the key national priority for our customers, and it has been receiving our leadership team's full attention. we've been proactive in our planning and response throughout this crisis. our engagement with employees, customers and partners is very high.
we are in regular communications and have adapted swiftly to the evolving conditions. throughout this, mantech has been operating with two key priorities in mind: first, the continued health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families, as well as those of our customers and our partners; second, maintaining continuity and the critical support for our customers and their important missions. in support of these two priorities, mantech has taken a number of our actions to establish strict social distancing metrics by establishing telework for our employees to the maximum extent possible and by placing restrictions on travel and in-person meetings. we have also established tightened hygiene standards through increased awareness and by working closely with customers to ensure safe workspaces and arrangements for those unable to telework given customer mission needs.
as you know, the defense industrial base is considered part of the critical infrastructure. it is our charter to help address the nation's broader needs during this crisis. along with those in our industry, we, at mantech, entered this national emergency supporting federal customers operating under full-year appropriations through september 30. as it relates to our business and workforce in responding to this crisis, our dod and federal civilian customers have been able to expand the use of telework and establish approaches to shift work and work schedules that minimizes the impact of the covid emergency on operations.
those customer missions and requirements most affected by the need for stringent social distancing measures are those that require access to highly classified systems and information, those where the work performed involve significant global and national travel or where supply chain issues may delay material purchases on select programs. while covid has forced some changes to how we operate, its impact on our business so far has been relatively light. we are thankful to our customers and the federal government at large for recognizing the value and necessity of the defense industrial base to national security. provisions in the cares act enacted in late march, specifically section 3610, an implementation of guidance provided by omb, dod, dni, dhs and others have made it clear that the intent is to support and maintain the defense industrial base, those supporting critical infrastructure, those assisting key federal health and citizen services needs and the highly skilled and highly cleared workforce supporting the intelligence community.
this guidance affords recovery of the costs related to our workforce that are unable to provide full-time support customer requirements due to workforce safety measures. looking forward, we are preparing to move toward a more normal operational environment as this national crisis subsides. currently, the administration and congressional focus appropriately remains on addressing the pandemic and resulting economic implications. as such, our sense is that moving to full operational status will be gradual, and we may be operating an additional portion of fy '21 under continuing resolution.
that said, we believe the agreed-upon two-year budget deal should afford a sound framework for funding levels, excluding additional funding that is established within the emergency funding bills. now let me shift to our performance in the quarter. on our last call, we provided a strong financial outlook for the year, and we delivered solid q1 performance. the quarter's performance was marked by healthy revenue growth of 22%, ebitda growth of 34%, ebitda margin expansion of 80 basis points and steady operating cash flows of $43 million.
additionally, we saw considerable hiring in the quarter with onboarding being done virtually in the latter half of march, i want to thank the broader team's vigilance on our customers' missions, which enabled another quarter of outstanding performance. that said, we are slightly tempering expectations for 2020 to factor in uncertainties during this crisis. judy will walk through the details of our financial performance and revised guidance a little later on the call. we had a solid quarter of contracts as well.
bookings totaled $1.1 billion, resulting in a 1.8 book-to-bill. new business made up over 90% of q1 awards, and total backlog grew to $9.3 billion, which was up 11%. funded backlogs sit at $1.4 billion. the durability and longevity of our backlog gives us good visibility to our revenue.
in response to customer requirements for q1, proposal and business development activity remained elevated. our proposals outstanding figure of approximately $7 billion exiting the quarter was strong. we did not see material delays in procurements for most of our business during q1. we were beginning to see signs that slippage may occur in some areas of the business in the coming quarters.
our customers have funding, and the requirements remain clear. however, the procurement and contracting processes needed to support near-term covid-19 contracting actions, as well as anticipated gradual phasing of work schedules back to a normal state may all contribute to delays. as a result, it is possible that adjudications and bookings could experience greater variability. our company and tested leadership team has supported many urgent needs in fluid operating environments before.
we're committed to supporting our customers' needs through this crisis. now judy will walk through the details of our q1 financial performance and revised outlook. judy?
judy bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin. we had a strong financial start to the year, and the results exceeded our expectations across all of our key measures. revenue for q1 was $611 million, up 22% with over two-thirds of the growth coming organically. sustained customer demand in the form of new contract wins and growth on existing programs, as well as our strategic acquisitions continued to serve as the major drivers of our growth.
as kevin mentioned, we had a healthy hiring quarter, and as a result, direct labor remained key to our overall top-line growth. in the quarter, we performed 91% of our work as a prime contractor, and our contract mix was approximately 68% cost-plus, 20% fixed-price and 12% time-and-materials. ebitda for the quarter was $55 million and grew 34% over q1 2019. ebitda margin of 9% outpaced our expectations and represented an 80-basis point improvement year over year.
margin in the quarter was primarily driven by strong program performance, good award fees, efficient cost management and some nonrecurring items. the bottom line was bolstered by our revenue growth and margin improvement but hampered slightly by a higher-than-expected tax rate. net income was $29 million, and diluted eps was $0.71 for q1, both up meaningfully compared to last year. healthy growth was also evident in our adjusted figures.
for the quarter, adjusted net income was $33 million, and adjusted diluted eps was $0.81, up 33% and 31%, respectively. now on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. for the quarter, we collected $43 million in cash flow from operations, representing 1.5 times net income. we did not see a major delay in ability to collect cash given most of our customers permit electronic invoicing.
and our dso level improved from last year, a quarter where we had a partial government shutdown. dso was 64 days at quarter-end, a six-day improvement from last year. consistent with prior communications, we distributed $13 million in dividends for the quarter. at quarter-end, we had $89 million in cash and $115 million of debt.
our net debt position remained similar to where we stood at the end of last year. as a cautionary liquidity measure, we drew against our revolver to ensure the smooth flow of cash to fund operations as we were monitoring the payment process for potential delays. despite the broader macro backdrop, our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged. we continue to focus on deploying capital to fund the growth of the business, maintain our quarterly dividend and accelerating growth via strategic m&a.
the m&a market has slowed as a result of the covid pandemic disruption. with that said, we anticipate m&a activity to increase as we recover from the pandemic. we are in an excellent position to review opportunities as they arise. our pristine balance sheet affords us great flexibility to capitalize on opportunities that fit our strategy.
now on to our revised 2020 guidance. compared to our previously communicated guidance, we are adjusting the ranges on revenue, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps. while we have seen minimal impacts to our financial performance in q1, we are exercising prudence in our revised view to take into account varying scenarios in the time and approach we will collectively need to get back to normal operations. we expect revenue to be between $2.35 billion and $2.45 billion, which represents 6% to 10% growth over 2019.
our recent awards and robust backlog provide good visibility for the rest of the year. however, the variability in our guidance will be driven by a number of factors, including the time it may take to get some of our employees with part of their work week in a mission-ready state back to full-time mission support, the level of material procurements, the timing of new contract awards, the ramp-up of recent contract awards and our success in winning new and recompete business. turning to margins, our guidance assumes an ebitda margin range of 8.7% to 8.8% for the year. the revised margin range reflects the outperformance in the first quarter, which is being offset by the margin decreases related to the lack of fee recovery for our employees who must spend part of their work week in a mission-ready state.
however, this still represents a potential of up to 10 basis points improvement compared to last year. at the bottom line, we are expecting adjusted net income between $120.3 million and $125.2 million and an adjusted diluted eps between $2.95 and $3.07. underlying these guidance ranges are an effective tax rate of 25.2% and a fully diluted share count of 40.8 million shares. note that we slightly modified our tax rate and fully diluted share count assumptions to reflect actuals observed in q1.
now to cash flow. we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be at least $150 million for the year. however, we expect capital expenditures to now range between 3% to 4% of revenue. the increases in capital expenditures are onetime in nature.
our customers showed higher demand on our managed services programs to accommodate remote work for their employees. and secondly, we are accelerating facility investments to support anticipated expansion and near-term facility needs for broader workforce distribution. as discussed on our last call, longer term, we expect capital expenditures to trend lower to more normalized levels. now matt will speak to our defense and federal civilian business.
matt tait -- president, mission solutions and services group
thanks, judy. mss is off to a solid start to 2020, particularly in winning new work. i'm excited to formally share with you additional details behind the $920 million five-year contract award that we briefly discussed on our last call. on this contract, mantech will modernize isr and electronic intelligence capabilities on the navy's fleet of manned, unmanned and persistent surveillance maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as other platforms.
the breadth of the work we will be providing on this program spans cyber, model-based systems engineering, platform integration and modernization, all of which are key capability strengths for mantech. we are excited that naval surface warfare center crane has trusted us with this important mission and are already working tirelessly to provide exceptional performance on this new effort as we do for all our customers. rick, over to you.
rick wagner -- president, mission, cyber and intelligence solutions group
thanks, matt. i am pleased to report that mcis had a good quarter as well. our people continue to be the key to mantech's differentiation, and their safety and well-being remains our utmost priority. as we all know, this highly skilled and highly cleared workforce is critical to national security and important to retain, so they can meet our customers' needs once this national emergency has passed.
as such, we are continuing to work closely with our government partners to ensure we strike the right balance while still delivering our important national security missions. we are thankful to our customers in providing us great flexibility through teleworking arrangements and allowing for portions of our work, where appropriate, to be conducted on an unclassified basis. we hope these structural trends continue in part long after this crisis is resolved to better facilitate the steady flow of hard-to-find, highly skilled, differentiated talent toward critical national security missions. i would note that the security clearance process is largely functional for those with existing clearances.
however, challenges exist in the processing of new clearances which may cause hiring delays. while there may be some near-term disruptions, our growth trajectory remains intact and driven largely by direct labor growth. within mcis and mantech, we remain well-positioned in the short, medium and long term to support the needs of our customers. with that, let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks.
kevin phillips -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, rick. in closing, let me leave you with three key thoughts before we take questions. first, mantech is a national and homeland security company operating during a national emergency. the security and success of our nation is foundational to who we are as a business and has been for over 50 years.
during this time, we are focused on the needs of our customers, the health and well-being of our employees and maintaining a workforce critical to national security. second, our business is strong. that includes our balance sheet, backlog, workforce and mission focus, all of which position us for future growth. third, we have always invested with an eye for the future and the growth that it brings.
we will keep an eye toward the future while we help our customers address critical issues during this unprecedented period. the entire mantech family offers our heartfelt grief for those who have been impacted by the covid-19 crisis, and we, again, offer our gratitude to all who our steadfastly helping our nation and its citizens through this difficult period. with that, we are ready to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of gautam khanna of cowen. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes, thank you. good afternoon. first just a specific question to the guidance in 2021. any -- can you frame the add backs? is there amortization, what have you, like how large that is and if there is a big change year-to-year with respect to that?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
with respect to amortization?
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. and the delta between gaap and adjusted eps.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
it's primarily just intangible amortization.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. and does that rise year-to-year? it looks like, i'm just trying to frame like below the line tax rates are a little bit higher, share counts down minimally or whatever up minimally. i think it's a 300,000 share change or so like, anything else we should be thinking about below the line or non-operationally?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, the amortization is dropping a little bit year-to-year.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. the other thing i just want to make sure i understand the -- like booz allen made a comment on their call about awards in the intelligence and cyber space, being a little soft. are you seeing any incremental slowdown or is this just kind of par for the course given the covid environment we're in and i just wondered if you've seen anything change since last quarter with respect to pace of procurement activity?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. hey, gautam. this is matt. we have not seen a change from our perspective. i think we've been telling you on the last few calls that there's -- that we'd expect the choppiness especially in defense and intel. i mean and so it's no surprise for us. and -- but we were very happy with 0.9 times book-to-bill in q4 that's actually was what we were expecting, because that's kind of seasonally soft for us, with a 1.5 times for the year.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay, so no change. and then lastly, can you characterize the m&a pipeline and what you might expect? do you think we'll see more properties come to market in 2021 than we saw in 2020 and how those might stack up to the deals you've done recently? are there any bigger opportunities that are potentially more juicy for mantech's perspective?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, we do expect 2021 to be very active on the m&a front. 2020, actually ended up much more active than we were expecting a few -- mid-year, last year. so we're going to continue to focus on making deals that fit within our strategic plan and are going to give us the capability or customer sets that we want to leverage and expand on. m&a has been in our dna and we continue to look at high properties and i'd be very surprised if we weren't able to find something that made sense for us this year. but as you're well aware it is a very competitive market and valuations are high.
gautam khanna -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks guys. best of luck.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thanks gautam.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tobey sommer of truist securities. your line is open.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. i was wondering if you could give us some more color on your recompete calendar this year and maybe discuss the timing in detail of any particularly chunky pieces of business that we should keep an eye on?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we don't really have any large recompetes. we don't even have any programs that are greater than say 5% of our revenue. we did see a number of recompete kind of slip out of 2020 into 2021, so we are seeing a little bit of a bunch up in kind of the second half of the year from recompetes but nothing crazy. so overall, about 80% of our midpoint of our guidance is coming from existing backlog and the balance kind of split between new and recompetes.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
is there an opportunity like there has been sort of over the last couple of years to go to your clients for which you have recompetes coming this year and sort of see if you can get an extension where you're performing well, so that it obfuscates the need for a recompete competition? or could you give us your perspective on that?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, tobey, this is matt. that is definitely one of the levers that we use as a part of our go-to-market strategy. so we -- while we can't comment on specifics on a contract-by-contract basis, that is definitely -- those conversations are definitely ongoing.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
how is the success rate than in recent years. and any reason to think that this year would be different?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
look, i think, if you look at i think 40% of our bookings were awarded on a sole source basis last year. that's a pretty healthy number. i can't -- are we going to be that high next year? i don't know, but again we are very -- there is definitely part of our go-to-market focus.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
tobey it's kevin, what i think you'll see across the spaces, there were some delays last year because of covid yet, there's only so much capacity within the acquisition workforce in the government. so they do have to make choices about what we spend their time on from a major recompete or competition standpoint and that's what causes delays across the customer as well. so it very much depends on the internal capacity that they have and what they can accomplish.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
all right. thanks. what is sort of internal billable headcount growth now and could you talk about your target for what kind of growth you may be able to achieve toward year-end or maybe for '21, if you want to speak about it from that perspective on a year-over-year basis and discuss the hiring and talent environment?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so tobey, this is matt. we typically don't give headcount statistics, but this past year we were -- our dl drove our growth for the year as evidenced by the results. so we're very happy with the hiring that we have been doing and so we have a similar plan going into '21 in terms of headcount and dl to drive the kind of growth that we're looking for.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
is there any rule of thumb that we should think of externally in terms of looking at dl and breaking apart the two major components, which would be volume and price?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, so i wouldn't over index on that tobey, just because we are moving to more of a solutions based organization. and so it's not exactly a one-for-one there.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. is the hiring and talent marketplace a constraint on growth. maybe you could just discuss that? the demand environment and the contracting activity win rates versus hiring and kind of give us those puts and takes?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure, sure. let me just make sure i answer. so on the -- you kind of talked about a couple of things there right? so i think from an industry perspective, yes, we would love to have more clear people in the overall population set to go to work. you've heard us talk about that and that's something that kevin has been leading as an active part right in terms of driving a reform around getting folks cleared. so we can bring more talent into the overall federal market space. so that's kind of the writ large commentary. but specifically for us, look, we've been very successful hiring the talent as we are rotating the business toward the technical -- five technical focus areas that i mentioned on the last call. our recruiting team has done a phenomenal job of that within the covid environment. now it's a competitive environment, but we're still able to hire the folks that we're looking for to go do the mission set work that we want to do. kevin do you want to add something?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
tobey, i'll add something just it's important for industry, not just for mantech but those individuals in those programs that are the highest level clearance, we'll have the largest delay in getting new talent in and also new awards because of the people physically have to be on-site to do the work and unless they clear through all the different covid hoops. so with that really higher echelon type of work, both the procurements and the talent influx that you will likely see the biggest delays.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, thanks, that's helpful. last thing from me. i heard you say cash flow impacted by working capital this year. i may have missed it. could you explain that a little bit further, please? thank you.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. we guided at least $200 million in cash flow from operations for 2021 which is down slightly from what we generated in 2020 and that basically is just driven by what might happen with dsos and other capex or capital requirement -- working capital requirements in the quarter -- in the year.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
could you elaborate as to what those factors are that make you want to accommodate for what may happen? is it covid related? are you bidding for some things with different payment terms, new customers, what are those factors?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think we've -- we saw a three-day improvement in dso in 2020. if that ticks back up, that alone almost gets us with a reduced -- that coupled with the growth gets us kind of to that level. so nothing unusual. we did see that it seems like the government was pushing cash out as that was related to incentives trying to make sure that there's money in the economy and getting small business paid given the covid environment. hard to say. so we're just being a little cautious if they were trying to what we've seen historically is more normal payment cycles.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. that sounds prudent. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt sharpe of morgan stanley. your line is open.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
kevin, judy, matt, good evening and nice quarter.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thank you.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
judy, just real quick on the revenue guidance. it looks like it's up 7% at the midpoint. what is that implying for organic growth? and then what was the book-to-bill or the bookings cadence need to look like to push you guys to the high end of the range this year?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
it's a combination. so to answer your first question the organic is about 5% or so at the midpoint. and i think the factors kind of getting us from the midpoint up are the timing of the awards and when they happen. so we could have a really strong book-to-bill, but if at all comes in, in the fourth quarter versus second quarter that's going to change that top line number and how much of it's recompete versus new would also impact that. so i think, just the factors that i mentioned on the -- in the prepared remarks about timing of awards, recompetes, material procurements as well as covid and the cares act extensions have -- are the factors that get us throughout that range.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it, ok. and then just on margins. how much of the 40 bps of expansion in 2020 was with either covid or mix related eg sort of lower material pass-throughs and how much was sort of underlying performance? is there any sort of pressure is where i'm going here with the question, is there any pressure on 2021 you're sort of flat to up 10 bps?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, so i mentioned we have this one-time adjustment in q4 which added probably over the course of the year about a 10 basis point uptick in ebitda margin. i think it really is the indirect spend, more normalizing which is we had a really strong performance, a little bit of headwind or tailwind that we talked about from labor utilization and indirect spend slightly under so looking to do a 10 basis point improvement, i think is something we're focused on. but given those headwinds with returning to more normalized indirect spend and labor utilization, we still think we can get there.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then just one last one if i may. on the employee base, some of your peers have pointed out a pto dynamic where resurgence in time off is potentially pressuring top line and/or margins? is -- has mantech experienced any of that or expect to see any of that dynamic play out through 2021?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, we definitely saw, i think, in q2 and q3 a reduction in pto usage. we saw a little more normalization in q4 around the holidays. so i think we're seeing people figuring it out, but it's definitely had a little bit of impact on revenue and margins in 2020 that again will -- the more of that normalizes, it will have some impact on revenue and margin, but we feel like within our guidance range we fully accounted for that.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mariana perez mora of bank of america. your question please.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
good afternoon.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so that 45% of 2020 awards were from new businesses. could you please describe what are mantech's relative advantages or strengths that position the company to continue taking market share?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
so, yes, this is kevin, i'll speak briefly. in terms of how we're getting new business to 45% and what we're doing around that, we've been fairly consistent over the last few years about investing in certain technology areas and we continue to do that. i think matt mentioned a number of them and then bringing those to the mission and solutions that our customers' needs. so we're literally trying to not get too far ahead of our customers but invest into solutions and bring to them, because it will be a new environment in the future that people need to operate that in especially in the dod in our view. and we're trying to provide that so the customers have a path. and as it relates to the new business in 2020...
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes so we are definitely, kind of focused on three main areas, right. so, one is around this business development. the second one is around our solutions. kevin kind of intimated on that but we really are doing that for the new solutions as well or new work and then the talent right, we really want to sharpen our competitive edge in terms of the type of talent we're bringing in, but also the additional training and certifications that we're giving them. and so we feel like when we combine all that together that we're going to continue to have the win rates that we've been enjoying over the last several years.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect, thank you. and then the next one is related to capex. capex going down to 2.5% of sales this year, could you please discuss what are the main capex requirement in the near to mid term?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so we -- the main capex is coming from a couple of our managed services contracts. so we came in a little bit lower this year than we were expecting at the start of the year because covdid did delay some tech refresh on one of those contracts that we expect to kind of normalize in 2021. and then we are doing some facility expansions related to secure gift [phonetic] space for -- to help support our customers. so those are kind of the primary drivers of capex. and i do think we've kind of like stabilized around that 2.5% of revenue and barring any significant changes i could see as the revenue growth continues that, that could drift down slightly.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. and my last one is related to ebitda. you saw an expansion in 2020 and expect to see another expansion in '21. what should we think the long-term looks like or what is embedded in your backlog today in terms of ebitda margin?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, we've kind of said, we're targeting the 10 basis points to 15 basis points per year. it really is going to depend on, as we see that shift toward more solution bids that matt talked about. and if we see a shift in contract mix away from that, almost 70% cost-plus we have now. those were the kind of things that would allow us to deliver a more meaningful margin expansion. so at this point in time we just kind of focus one year out on what we think we can deliver.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robert spingarn of credit suisse. your line is open.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. i don't know if this is for kevin, matt, judy. but in terms of the new administration, are we seeing any priority shift yet from them. i know they talk a lot about cyber and so on. but does any of that come through yet or is it too soon?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
it's too soon. i think at a high level, the guidance of what they're focusing on in terms of newer technologies, whether it's nationally or applied within the government as they need to protect those technologies and deployment of futures of conflict as well as where those conflicts might be in this is outside of the us borders and i think the one area that we will see more focus that will be tracking is clearing covid, that's clearly a priority, getting through whatever acclimate approaches and strategies need to effect through our customer sets. but beyond that, i think that there is less change from the technology areas that we're focused on from administration because of the external threats that those changes are being responsive to.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. so there is a consistency and it's not like you need to go out and do particular m&a or anything to realign with the future mandate, so to speak.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
no, we still think it's more of a talent issue against the opportunity set than it is or other market setting.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then related to that, there has been some talk out there. we've seen a lot of silicon valley interest in the beltway and in government customer from a technology perspective. are you seeing any disintermediation from that crowd trying to get into your markets? and are they having any success with that?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
i think if you look at that, probably the overall answer you will get is mixed, right? you definitely have silicon valley folks trying to come in and a lot of that through like diux, but they also don't know how to do contracting within the federal market space. so a lot of times they'll come to try and join our partnership to go make it happen. so i think, well, there is definitely innovation that has been asked for by the federal market or by the federal government overall, which we think is a great thing and aligns with our strategy. i mean, i think the silicon valley folks that are trying to get into this environment, what we're seeing is they can -- we see that as ways to actually help us from a solution perspective versus anything that's a competitive.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. okay. and judy, just quickly, i don't know if this was covered already, but cadence for the year, how we should think about sort of the quarterly cadence as we move through the year here? and i think you already talked about the organic growth in '21 being closer to 5%. what was it in the quarter when you had the acquisitions?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
in the quarter it was 5%.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay and then just on that cadence?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. as you know, we really don't give out quarterly guidance, but it is, we think a moderate step up throughout the year from q4 of 2020.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. so sort of the normal trajectory.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
i call it boring good, i guess and hoping some more of that.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of louie dipalma of william blair. your line is open.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
kevin, matt, judy and stephen, good afternoon. given how mantech has high exposure to government cyber security, has the solarwinds cyber breach materially impacted any of your contracts? and longer term can you access or assess any of the specific impacts that it may have on demand for cyber security services and cleanup in remediation of what took place?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. so from a solarwinds perspective, i can't talk about specific customers in terms of what they've been impacted, right? i mean, i think any of the customers that we serve, they're making their own public declarations there. so i don't want to comment specifically on that. but i do think, or at least what we are seeing is, because of this, more conversations in dollars that are trying to figure out how to stop this from happening again. so from a demand perspective, we think that this is going to continue to keep the focus on cyber and drive additional demand and do that in places that we are already in. so from an overall cyber demand we expect this to increase and elevate.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
this is kevin. i will add that from a national policy level, i do think we're going to see more maturity around that both from a national defense side, i mean protecting all of the nation and also how the government reacts to these events differently or more aggressively, one of the other. so i do think that from a policy level we will see a shift and we'll obviously tune this to what that does for our sector and for broader national strategy.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. and switching gears then a little bit, late in 2019 mantech announced that it won $132 million task order to provide software and systems engineering for the army's distributed common ground system program. and related to that, i was just wondering, could you provide a quick overview of mantech's involvement with the army and air force network and isr modernization efforts. like we've seen other similar types of army contracts, like capability set, 23 prototypes than recently there is a report about this project tied in for network modernization. can you provide like a quick overview of like how mantech's involved in programs such as like the dcgsa and others?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes. so the shorthand term we use is d6 for that program and that's one of many examples that we have across the army, air force and navy where we're doing intelligent systems engineering work as well as you combine that with other technical focus -- technology focus areas we've talked about like analytics and cyber. so that is one example where we're trying to really bring digital to the mission where with the army we have several contracts, air force and navy as well, not that we talk in detail on specific contracts on the call here. but that is definitely in alignment with our strategy, doing that type of work, because we think it's good mission work that supports our nation.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joseph denardi of stifel. please go ahead.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good evening. kevin, just in regard to louie's question or sorry, maybe was matt, you talked about seeing i guess the potential for increase in demand in dollars coming from solarwinds. is it fair to say that that's not, that hasn't yet converted into awards or opportunities necessarily that's still on the come and hopefully going to in the near future. is that how you all look about it -- look at it?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, i'd say that's fair, joe. we're definitely having, i'll say multiple conversations across multiple customer sets around these topics right now.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
okay. okay. and then maybe a question for kevin. can you quantify for us how much of the portfolio is actually aligned with their position to benefit from cyber and if you're not willing or able to quantify that which i'm suspecting is the case, could you maybe talk about how you would go about conducting that exercise if you are an investor?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
well, i'll speak more broadly, for mantech if it's looking at it, analytics, automation, cyber in providing technology for missions support that business today is 85% or more of our business when you combine that, whereas maybe five years ago oco alone 10 years ago was 60% of our business, though it is a much higher concentration of our business, how that gets affected from a growth standpoint, very much depends on the procurement process our government has and what they decided to prioritize as we mentioned before. but we do think that we're in a very good spot from a capability standpoint against where the market needs are for the next few years.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then kevin, you also mentioned that the talent is the challenge, it's not the budget or a lack of opportunities. can you just talk about kind of what that means practically? if tomorrow you could find everyone you wanted, if you could bill more that there are essentially unspent dollars out there because there is a shortage of talent. is that right?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
yes and yes. so we have internal degree programs and price points for targeting upskilling as well as certification processes that we paid for because we want to get the internal resources we have. and those veterans who come into the company are scaled toward what we think the growth of the future is both for them professionally and for us, and bring that talent in. there are just is not enough talent with clearance and take technology capability supporting national security period. we'll hear that consistently from the government and from early contractor you talk to.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
can you quantify what the shortage is? is it 3% or is it 30%?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
in terms of -- i would probably say...
matt tait -- chief operating officer
i wouldn't hazard a guess.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
yes, i agree that. so there's a lot of openings.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
but i do think that, yes, we have a lot of customers that would love to be able to -- it's also -- but this is also budget driven, right. so we're kind of opening up until a max theoretical world that we probably would need to consider other factors.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that's fair enough. and then just lastly, matt, when the budget comes out in a few months hopefully. what do you look at first if anything, what page do you flip to first?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, for us, we really want to make sure that the budget is aligning to the priorities that we've talked about today, right. the intelligence system engineering, cyber, analytics automation and ai and as well as mission and enterprise it and data at the edge. so we look at those things. we look to make sure that those things are prioritized within the budget. we are obviously keeping tabs on those things to make sure that they are and so we feel -- that we continue to see good alignment to our overall strategy in terms of those capability sets.
joseph denardi -- stifel -- analyst
okay, thank you.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, thanks, joe.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
operator. it appears that we have no further questions at this time. as usual, members of our senior team will be available for follow-up questions. thank you all for your participation on today's call and your interest in mantech. have a good evening.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the mantech fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to stephen vather, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president, m&a and investor relations
welcome everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's fourth quarter call. joining me today is kevin phillips, our chairman, ceo and president; judy bjornaas, our cfo; and matt tait, our coo.
during this call we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call.
on today's call we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our fourth quarter earnings release.
with that, let me hand the call over to kevin.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
thanks, stephen. good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. before i walk you through our 2020 results, i want to spend a few minutes updating you on the operating environment. 2020 brought forth unconventional personal and professional challenges for us all. despite this lingering challenges, our people remained resilient and committed to delivering excellence for our customers and their critical missions. i want to thank both our employees and customers for showing great strength and willingness to adapt quickly and for their continued perseverance throughout this ongoing pandemic. i also want to thank our employees for their continued generosity, not only do they enable critical outcomes for our customers, but they are beacons within their communities. since the start of the pandemic, our employees have raised over $2 million to support those most impacted by the pandemic. one year into the crisis, i am satisfied with how we have managed the business while keeping a steadfast focus on our employee safety and our customers' critical missions.
our 2020 financial performance exceeded our expectations across all measures and we closed out the year on solid footing. we delivered our fifth consecutive year of healthy organic growth, increased profitability and margins, generated robust cash flow and successfully retained new and existing business to fuel the continued growth of our record backlog. in the fourth quarter, we executed on our commitment to deploy capital for long-term growth and did so through two small strategic acquisitions that add to our full spectrum cyber solutions within the intelligence community and department of defense.
i'm pleased to welcome the talented employees from both minerva engineering and tapestry technologies into the mantech family. i look forward to the team leveraging the enhanced customer capability position. we have ample financial capacity to continue creating value through m&a and will prioritize acquisitions that add to our differentiated capabilities.
now to a few thoughts on the market environment. i am pleased at the fy '21 ndaa and appropriations were enacted in december. this offers our customers clear visibility in the funding levels for their mission critical requirements. consistent with expectations set forth under the last two year budget deal, the fy '21 appropriations provides for $696 billion for the department of defense. additionally, embedded in the legislation passed in late december was an extension of cares act section 3610 coverage through march.
since our last call, a number of important events have transpired including the election, announcement of multiple viable covid vaccines and a catastrophic cyber attack. over the course of our 50 plus year history, we have executed consistently for our customers irrespective of the political composition of congress and the white house as well as across different national security priorities and threats. the new administration is experienced and understands the complexity of the global threat environment and recognizes the need for rapid technology insertion to compact the challenges. the threat environment remains elevated and multi-vectored with a growing and continued trend that these threat vectors are not solely kinetic. of course this was most recently evidenced by the solarwinds hack. as the administration evaluates in response to the aftermath of this hack, a few points are clear. cyber is a priority and we expect that our national cyber posture as well as our response will be a big focus area.
mantech has a multi-decade track record for advancing customer missions in this domain and continues to be integrally involved in the cyber mission across a number of customers today. in addition to cyber, the administration is focused on digital expansion and modernization across all aspects of the federal government as well as the domains of warfare which is providing longevity to the customer demand levels experienced over the last few years.
overall, i believe that mantech is well positioned to continue to support our customers' mission sets with our differentiated solutions that span not only cyber & it modernization, but also other priority areas including the analytics, automation and intelligent systems engineering.
let me offer some brief thoughts on the business development front. we exited the year with an annual 1.5 times book-to-bill. despite the disruptions from the pandemic, we submitted proposal volumes consistent with 2019 and expect this level to remain relatively constant going into 2021. that said, we remain focused on expanding our market position and differentiation in a competitive market. i am pleased with what we accomplished in 2020 and look forward to maintaining this operational execution and strategic focus.
now judy will walk through the details of our 2020 financial performance and 2021 outlook. judy?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, kevin. we continue to execute well and build upon our track record of generating strong financial result with the focus on long-term value creation. revenue for the year was $2.5 billion, up 13% year-over-year with 11% organically. the growth was primarily driven by new contract wins, growth on existing programs and our strategic acquisitions. for the fourth quarter revenue was $639 million, up 6% over 2019. for both the quarter and full year, direct labor was a critical driver of our growth. our contract mix largely remained unchanged year-over-year. in 2020 time contracts comprised 91% of revenue and the breakout of our contract pricing structures was approximately 68% cost-plus, 19% fixed price and 12% time and materials.
ebitda for the quarter was $59 million for an ebitda margin of 9.3%. q4 ebitda benefited from a one-time facility amortization adjustment. excluding the impact of this one-time item, ebitda margins for the quarter would have been consistent with the balance of 2020. for the year, ebitda was $228 million, up 18%. ebitda margin for the year was 9.1%, up 40 basis points from 2019, exceeding our expectations and more than accomplishing our targeted incremental margin improvement. strong direct labor utilization and lower pto usage as well as indirect cost management, continue to provide tailwinds to margins. net income was $32 million and diluted eps was $0.79 for q4. for the full year, net income was $121 million and diluted eps was $2.97. as a reminder, our q4 2019 and full year 2019 net income and diluted eps benefited from a pick-up related to the reassessment of multi-year r&d tax credits.
adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps, which excludes the r&d tax credit impact as well as the impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles articulates more representative operational growth. adjusted net income was $36 million and adjusted diluted eps was $0.89, both up 10%. for the year, adjusted net income was $137 million and adjusted diluted eps was $3.36, up 17% and 15% respectively.
now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. for the year we collected $247 million in cash flow from operations. a robust 2.1 times net income. dso was 56 days at year-end, a 3-day improvement from last year. as kevin mentioned, we executed on two smaller acquisitions in the fourth quarter. additionally, we distributed $52 million in dividends for the year, maintaining a steady return of cash to shareholders. at year-end, we had $41 million in cash and $15 million of debt. given the strength of our balance sheet and expected cash flow, the board has authorized us to raise our quarterly dividend by $0.06 to $0.38 per share, a 19% increase from current levels. this dividend will be paid in march and equates to an annualized dividend of $1.52 or a yield of approximately 1.7%.
now on to our 2021 guidance. we expect revenue to be between $2.65 billion and $2.75 billion. the midpoint of the revenue range implies 7% growth and approximately 80% of guidance is expected to come from current backlog, with the balance from recompetes and new business. we are seeing greater variability and the timing of awards, particularly for new business and compared to the last few years, we faced an increased level of recompetes in 2021. turning to margins. our guidance assumes an ebitda margin of 9.1% to 9.2% for the year, which offers the potential for incremental margin improvement of up to 10 basis points. however, we expect that strong direct labor utilization driven in part by below average pto usage will normalize and be a headwind in 2021.
some of the other factors that could influence our performance within our revenue and margin guidance include the trajectory path of the recovery from the pandemic, the level timing and ramp of contract awards, the level of material procurements and the duration and level of reliance of the cares act 3610 coverage. our resulting 2021 guidance for adjusted net income is between $142.5 million and $147.4 million and for an adjusted diluted eps between $3.48 and $3.60.
a few assumptions for your models, built into our guidance is an effective tax rate of 24% and a fully diluted share count of 41 million shares. cash flow from operation should be at least $200 million for the year. all of the year-over-year decline is attributable to working capital. we expect capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of revenue for the year, which is down from 2020.
now over to matt to cover the business development and operational highlights in the quarter.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thanks. judy. let me expand on what kevin highlighted earlier. in the fourth quarter we won $605 million of contract awards, resulting in a 0.9 times book-to-bill which aligned with our expectations. overall, we had a successful year on the business development front. in 2020, we secured $3.7 billion in contract awards, leading to a 1.5 times book-to-bill. new business comprised approximately 45% of awards for the year. our success was evident across our customer base and our key capabilities in intelligent systems engineering, full spectrum cyber, mission and enterprise it, analytics and programs in support of intelligence operations. nearly 40% of our bookings were awarded on a sole source basis in the year. as a result of our strong 2020 bookings, we exited the year with total backlog of over $10 billion, up 12% and funded backlog stood at $1.2 billion.
entering 2021, our total qualified pipeline remains over $30 billion with approximately $6 billion of proposals awaiting adjudication. our expectation is that there will be steady proposal submissions throughout the year for a relatively even mix of recompete and new work. we are seeing demand across customers and capabilities. 2021 will continue our multi-year journey to further develop capability differentiation across our business with a focus on our solutions in cyber, analytics, automation, edge computing and systems engineering.
our capabilities and talent are fundamentally intertwined and as such attracting, developing and retaining talent remain a key priority for us. we have a strong track record of investing in our talent and most recently announced that we will be offering tuition free access to an advanced analytics degree offered by the university of maryland global campus. this is one of many initiatives focused on our people and our enduring drive to be the employer of choice in the industry. our ability to clearly articulate and demonstrate mantech's value proposition to our existing and prospective talent in a virtual operating environment is critical.
with that, let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
thanks, matt. in closing, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our 2020 performance. we're executing well and building on this foundation to deliver long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders. our strategy and business focus remains sound as we enter 2021 and look to the national priorities of the new administration. we remain agile with a demonstrated ability to proactively position and quickly pivot to navigate through complex operating challenges as evidenced by our handling of the business over the last year. core to our agility and operating philosophy is empowering and enabling our talented employees to do what is in the best interest of our customers and the nation.
with that, we're ready to take your questions.
",2020-Q4,MANT
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen. sir, please go ahead.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
gautam, are you on?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
gautam
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
sorry about that. i was on mute there.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
i know it's a very important. i love it.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
that was the easiest one of the day. hey, i was going to ask on the odc dynamic, what was the shortfall there relative to your going-in expectation? and do you expect 100% of whatever that shortfall is to be made up later this year? and if so, kind of when? is it q3? is it q4?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. that's the problem with these materials, they're so lumpy with when they come in and i think some of it was probably supply chain. i don't know if you've tried to order a refrigerator lately, but you just can't get things. but the customers are -- the demand is still there. the timing, we fully expect it to come through at some point this year, whether that's next quarter, more likely second half, but we do expect it to be made up.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
and did you give a figure for it? i may have missed it, judy, if you said how much specifically was -- yes.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, we did not. no.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. but you would have expected a sequential increase in sales. maybe could you speak to what the sequential decline in odcs was quarter-to-quarter?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean direct labor was definitely greater than the total top line growth. the odcs were down, i think, mid-single digits.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. no, that's helpful and then just on the bookings environment, $8 billion of outstanding bids as of the quarter end. how do those phase in terms of when they're expected to be adjudicated over? is it like a big q2 and a big q3? or any sort of color you can give us on kind of when those are expected, the bulk of those to be adjudicated?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
gautam, this is kevin. i think when we talk about the choppiness, it's uncertain as to when they will be adjudicated because there's so much volume out there. i would note in terms of color is that it's -- over half is new business, but we do have an increasing proportion of that total under the half that is recompete. so some of the things that have been kind of pushing to the right we see more likely to be recompeted in our business in the second half of this year and going into early next year. but we still have a very healthy pipeline of new work in that. and adjudications, as we noted, are very much contingent on the workforce in the government, their prioritization, how quickly they can get to things, what they prioritize. and if not, they generally delay. and how that plays out quarter-to-quarter is very hard for us to predict.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
thank you
operator
and sir we do have our next question from robert spingarn from credit suisse. sir, your line is open.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. hi, good afternoon. judy, what was the organic sales growth in the quarter? and then what is embedded in the guide, i guess, at the midpoint?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it's a little over 1% in the quarter, and then the midpoint of the guide is about 5%.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay and then, kevin, on that, just does the reversal in odcs get you to that 5%? and can you get there with the kind of hiring and award pace you had in q1? or does that also have to improve?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
the award pace has to improve for our entire industry and for mantech in order to get to that growth level. i think that the hiring is not a constraint. the odcs, we expect to be caught up in the end.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thanks so much. i'll jump back in.
operator
and sir your next question from tobey sommer from truist securities. your line is open.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is jasper bibb on for tobey. i guess following up on first quarter margins and the odc impact, could you give any color on the cadence of how you, i guess, expect margins to track over the balance of the year as that rolls off?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean, we're expecting the 9.1%, 9.2% for the full year. so clearly, it's going to trend down over the course of the year based on -- as odcs pick up as well as indirect spending picks up. so i think it will drop in q2 and then kind of normalize.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
and then i wanted to ask about how the company is thinking about total addressable market growth in the current environment. i guess while you've grown above defense top line for some time, does that trajectory change at all with what we're seeing in the president's request for '22?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
this is kevin. i'll speak to that and then if matt wants to add any flavor behind that or color behind that. so we all are very focused, and i think we've done a good job as a company to position where we think within the overall federal budgets the higher proportion of needs will be, specifically around certain technologies and technology growth and you can see within the current administration that they continue to focus on the need for a technology-driven economic competition as well as military competition. how that plays out within the details of the dod budget or the federal budget for fy '22 when it comes out, i think we have to all wait and see where that lands as well as for '23 pom and so those are very important to our sector to track. that said, i think that we've done a good job of positioning where we think the budgets will be above average within whatever budget levels they will be.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
last question for me. could you just update us on how the recompete schedule has been progressing so far this year? and the 20% or so initially up for recompete this year, how much do you have left?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. as i said in the comments, we've got a little over 80% in backlog at the midpoint and the balance is probably split equally between recompetes and new, just given the timing of the recompete wins and we have seen a few decisions came in, and then a lot of the continued proposals outstanding are recompetes and we're waiting for those to be awarded, but it's definitely second half loaded and then into 2022.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the question and i'll get back in the queue.
operator
and our next question from louis dipalma from william blair. sir your line is open.
louis dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great. kevin, judith and stephen, good afternoon. you mentioned procurement delays, kevin and judy. has there also been delays to your ramp of some of your recent large contract wins?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so i would say on the odcs is relative to that ramp-up. but i think all other programs, i think, are going along just fine and like judy mentioned, right, our dl growth is above the top line growth that you mentioned. so i think that we're -- overall, i think those are progressing nicely.
louis dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great and as it relates to some of the procurement delays that you referenced, would you cite the administration change and covid as the two biggest drivers behind those procurement delays? or is there something else that's taking place?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes. so i think those are both valid in terms of what we're seeing at large. covid, a large portion of our workforce, right, is doing shift work in certain mission areas and then there is -- obviously, there's always a little bit of change that happens. so priorities get more reinforced or less. so i think those are things that we're all working through and that everyone is working through, but i think those are two of the bigger things we are seeing at a macro level.
louis dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
okay and as it, i guess, relates to both of those variables from december through april, has there been any easing of these headwinds that you've witnessed? and do you expect there to be improvement in the second half of the year?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
no and yes. so there hasn't been improvement in the first quarter, but we do expect improvement because people are getting back in the government to help adjudicate and to move to normal operations and that will help with the pace of, hopefully, all things, getting talent as well as adjudicated decisions and procurement decisions within funded amounts.
louis dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
awesome. thanks kevin, judith, stephen.
operator
and our next question is from mariana perez mora of bank of america. ma'am your line is open.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
hello
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hello
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
so first question, also related to this choppiness on the task ordering. how -- i know it's hard to predict the future, but how should we read current funded backlog and how that should translate into organic growth in like midterm -- short to midterm?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. we did see an uptick in our funded backlog in q1, which i think is just kind of the normal timing of them putting funding on it. i don't think there's -- we've seen anything unusual or different in the timing of receiving funding. so i don't think it really has changed anything from our expectations.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and then related to capital deployment, with an increasing market appetite for shareholder, like share buybacks, how those buybacks play a role in your capital deployment strategy and priorities?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean we always look at all of our options. we increased the dividend almost 20% this year and as you know, from our numerous conversations, m&a continues to be our preferred capital deployment method and we're seeing a lot of activity in the m&a market and as kevin mentioned, we're going to continue to focus on those. so we look at buybacks. but for now, it just hasn't seemed like something that we think makes the most sense for our shareholders and i don't know if our esteemed chairman wants us to add anything from the board perspective, but we definitely -- we look at that.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
yes, we do review it. look, i think it's a very active m&a market and it's one of those markets whether we are successful or not, i think that we're a little bit more aggressive around that because of the properties that are out there and see our positioning around that is our first priority still.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect and what are you looking for in the m&a market?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
well, we have -- there are a lot of good businesses out in the market right now. we know it's very competitive, but we're looking for technology advancement, both for a combination of technology and engineering and certain technologies around the technical focus areas that we've mentioned before in the customer areas where we see growth in the federal budget. we're tracking heavily what the administration's details are on their fy '22 components. that's a very important activity, but it's a very active market right now from an m&a perspective for all of us in our industry.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. i have one more of a jump back in the queue. all right.
operator
[operator instructions] and speakers, we have a follow-up question from robert spingarn of credit suisse. sir your line is open.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. i wanted to follow up on m&a. there's a couple of questions around m&a, kevin. one is, do the proposed tax changes accelerate the number of properties that are coming on to the market? so is there more in the pipeline recently? so that's the first question.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
the answer is, i believe, that's a driver, yes. it has certainly through last year -- this year has been inferred as something that has people thinking about options.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay and then related to that, when you think about valuations, how have those trended relative to a year ago as we get through the pandemic or maybe the proposed budget possibly affects that? and then in addition to that, are you looking at companies in the -- in nondefense, more in the civilian markets or even in the hardware areas like some of your peers have, so maybe defense but defense hardware?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
yes. so for quality businesses, the market is fairly hot in terms of demand. so i think the multiples are at or above where they've been. they're not declining in any way and that's great in terms of the view of where the federal budgets are headed in those areas. that's why they are such high demand and high value. in terms of positioning, yes, we are looking to expand in federal civilian selectively, nondefense. we still focus on defense and intelligence, cyber as core business areas. but at the same time, we do see a lot of opportunity but from a budget placement as well as capability placement into the federal civilian market.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay and then, judy, just one more question. just on the five day increase in the dsos, and i think you said you anticipated working capital headwind here. will that reverse? or does it reflect some kind of change in progress payments?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, we actually don't have any progress payments. it's just a timing issue. it is an actual -- it's an improvement over where we were in q1 of last year and we do expect that we should get another day or two improvement over the course of the year.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you both
operator
and your next question from brian kinstlinger of alliance global partners. sir your line is open.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
brian we cannot hear you
jacob silverman -- alliance global partners -- analyst
sorry, can you hear me now?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
jacob silverman -- alliance global partners -- analyst
this is jacob on for brian. can you quantify any onetime benefits on sg&a during the first quarter? and then with growth in defense spending expected to slow, does management plan to increase the amount of proposal activity that will lead to slightly lower operating margins in the near term?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll answer the first question and then have you repeat the second part. we had a couple of small onetime items, nothing major. it was more just timing of indirect spending still in kind of the pandemic, your indirect fab was low. there's no trade shows and things like that. so not really any specific onetime items.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
and it's kevin, i'll answer your second piece. so we're not anticipating the business profile of what we're going after to change our approach to the overall price or overall fee we're trying to achieve when we compete. if the market changes on that, we'll all be addressing it. it's certainly competitive. but we don't expect to be lowering our overall margin profile in order to compete and win business.
jacob silverman -- alliance global partners -- analyst
all right. thanks so much.
operator
and speakers, we have a follow-up question from mariana perez mora of bank of america. ma'am your line is open.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much. so my follow-up is on free cash flow. any color on free cash flow burn this quarter? and how should we think about it for the rest of the year and especially about working capital conversion and also capital deployment -- sorry, capex?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think over the -- for the balance of the -- or for the full year, we expect cash flow to be roughly equivalent to net income. we expect it to pick up next quarter and then the balance of the year, just as we modified the working capital and the capex drops over the course of the balance of the year.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
and speakers, we still have one follow-up question from gautam khanna of cowen. sir, your line is open. please ask your question.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
yeah, thank you. just wanted to ask on recompetes. if you could remind us again what percentage of sales this year is up for rebid? when most of those are expected to occur? and did you have any meaningful recompete losses in the first quarter?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so as i said a little bit earlier, of the 20% -- approximately 20% of the midpoint of guidance that's coming from newer recompete, it's about 50-50, so 10%-ish or so of the 2021 revenue from recompetes. it's obviously a slightly higher number of actual annualized revenue because it is definitely back-end loaded and going into 2022, it's still that probably normalized 25% or so of recompetes.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay and in q1, was there anything of consequence that was lost?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
it looks like we have no further questions. so thank you all for your participation on today's call and your interest in mantech. as usual, members of our senior team will be available for any follow-up questions. have a good evening, and please stay safe.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to the mantech's first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to stephen vather, vice president, corporate development and investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thank you. welcome, everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's first quarter call. joining me today is kevin phillips, our chairman, ceo and president; judy bjornaas, our cfo; and matt tait, our coo.
during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. on today's call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our first quarter earnings release.
with that, let me hand the call over to kevin.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. mantech continues to perform well overall. our first quarter results demonstrated steady execution and strong profitability, which was evident by our ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share as well as our margins. while our industry and company have fared better than others on a relative basis over the past year, the pandemic and its duration has created a somewhat choppy operating environment. as a result, quarterly revenue growth was tempered by lighter odcs and customer procurements shifting to the right.
while procurement delays persist in pockets, we made good progress in submitting proposals in q1 and the volume of our proposals outstanding group. the uneven market environment is likely to linger for a few more quarters. however, the long-term fundamentals and positioning of the business remains sound. our view is reinforced by a few secular trends, namely the fact that national security threats are not abating and that there is a persistent need for technology modernization for both it and physical platforms with an increasing convergence of the two. that said, the associated market opportunities are still bound by budget realities. the administration recently provided their fy '22 budget request, which calls for $753 billion for defense and $769 billion for nondefense, which represents proposed increases of approximately 2% and 16% over enacted levels, respectively.
we look forward to seeing the details of the request later in may to confirm our understanding of the administration's priorities. it is our hope that the budget details are released in the near term to provide our customers with sufficient clarity into their funding levels against their critical-mission requirements. our country's national security strategy continues to place an increasing priority on deterring near-peer threats, which is a substantial shift away from the two decade strategy centered on the global war on terror. this strategy is materializing on a number of fronts, including a decision to depart from afghanistan by september 11 of this year.
as a reminder, mantech's exposure in-country today is relatively small, representing low single digits of annual revenue, much different from where the business was ten years ago. we view the drawdown of our military presence in afghanistan as a potential opportunity for the dod to repurpose funds toward technology that will advance modernization and bring new capabilities to meet near-peer national security threats. many of you have been on this journey through us and with us to evolve the business toward delivering differentiated solutions as well as pursuing customers that prioritize innovation. this focus on positioning and execution remains a top priority as we begin to operate in a potentially more rigid budget environment. i'll round out my market commentary by noting that cyber remains an enduring national priority.
the administration is recruiting well-experienced thought leaders to key cyber positions and recently named its national cyber director and a leader for cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, adding breadth and depth to our broader national security team. mantech's solid reputation and distinguished full-spectrum cyber capabilities position us well for continued growth in this time. shifting gears to talent. competitive pressures in the labor market have not related, and attracting highly cleared professionals is an enduring challenge. we are pleased with the steady support from congress in recognizing the scarcity and criticality of preserving talent supporting critical national security missions and applaud its most recent extension of the cares act section 3610 coverage through september 30.
our reliance on this provision has been steadily declining as customers move toward normalized operations. but it remains a critical tool relied upon by many in the industry in retaining highly skilled and highly cleared talent. as national vaccination progress rolled out, we are planning for a welcome return for more normalized operations. consistent with our operating philosophy since the start of the pandemic, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our utmost priority. we recognize that we will all be operating in a new normal and are tailoring our approach in a manner that supports mantech's goal of being the employer of choice in our industry.
sticking with talent, i am pleased to announce that we reinforced our leadership ranks with the promotion of julie anna barker to the role of mantech's chief human resources officer; and the appointment of joe cubba as our chief growth officer. julie anna has served as interim chro since last december, seamlessly advancing mantech's initiatives and attracting, developing and retaining talent. joe joined us in march, assuming the charter of our sales and growth activities and is working in tandem with our operations team and technologists to drive mantech's differentiated solutions across the federal market. i look forward to working closely with them both as they bring their passion, experience and hands-on leadership to empower our employees and customers alike.
now judy will walk through the details of our q1 financial performance. judy?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin. we are steadily executing with a keen focus on generating long-term value for our stakeholders. revenue for the quarter reached $633 million, up 4% compared to q1 of 2020. as kevin mentioned earlier, lighter odcs and new business procurement delays drove growth below our expectations for the quarter. that said, direct labor remains strong and cascaded throughout the p&l, with its impact most conspicuous in our profit metrics. our contract mix shifted slightly year-over-year. in q1, prime contracts comprised 93% of revenue and the breakout of our contract pricing structure was approximately 66% cost-plus; 21% fixed price; and 13% time and materials. the lighter odcs shifted our cost-plus mix lower in the quarter. ebitda for the quarter was $62 million, which grew 12% from q1 of 2020.
this resulted in an ebitda margin of 9.7%, reflecting margin improvement of 70 basis points year-over-year. the increased margins were primarily driven by two factors: a higher-than-usual labor mix caused by the slippage of odcs and the consistent strength of our indirect cost management. our expectation is that those odcs will eventually be procured and increased indirect spending will return profitability to more normalized levels. the tax rate was 23% in the quarter, just slightly lower than expected with the majority of the bottom line strength coming from operational execution. net income was $32 million and diluted eps was $0.79 for q1, up 13% and 11% from q1 2020, respectively.
adjusted net income was $36 million and adjusted diluted eps was $0.88, up 11% and 9%, respectively, from last year. now on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. for the quarter, cash used in operations was $8 million. this is exclusively attributable to an expected uptick in net working capital. dso was 61 days at the end of the quarter, a five-day increase from the fourth quarter of 2020. at quarter end, the balance sheet showed $7 million in cash and $22 million of debt. additionally, we distributed $15 million in dividends in q1. the board has authorized us to maintain our current cash quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share, which will be paid in june. our strong balance sheet and cash flow position provides us with ample financial flexibility to invest for future organic growth, value-enhancing m&a and continuing to return cash to shareholders. we are actively reviewing potential m&a opportunities, and we'll execute on those that align to our strategic and financial goals.
now on to guidance. we are reiterating our previously communicated guidance on all measures. the factors that we see as having the most significant impact on our ability to perform within the ranges provided include the rate at which we are able to successfully win new business and retain our recompetes as well as the timing of each, particularly the new business, the pace of hiring and ramping new and recent contract awards, the level and timing of material procurements, direct labor utilization trends and the cadence of normalization as the impact of the pandemic subsides. just to refresh you on the expectations we set in february and are reaffirming here today, we expect revenue of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 9%.
at the midpoint of guidance, a little more than 80% of the revenue is expected to come from existing backlog with still a fair bit of the plan from recompetes and new business. for margins, our guidance continues to assume an ebitda margin of 9.1% to 9.2% for the year, maintaining the profitability for incremental margin improvement of up to 10 basis points year-over-year. turning to our bottom line. we expect an adjusted net income range of $142.5 million to $147.4 million and an adjusted diluted eps range of $3.48 to $3.60. these ranges still assume an effective tax rate of 24% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 41 million shares. lastly, despite our cash flow use this quarter, we still expect cash flow from operations of at least $200 million and expect capex to be around 2.5% of revenue for the year.
now i'll turn it over to matt to cover the business development and operational highlights for the quarter.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thank you, judy. let me walk through the business development and operational highlights from the quarter. we won $561 million of contract awards, resulting in a 0.1 -- 0.9 book-to-bill in q1. our differentiated capabilities in cyber, mission and enterprise it and intelligent systems engineering are apparent in these awards. we won a new $123 million cybersecurity-as-a-service contract with a long-standing customer, the fbi. we continue to leverage our strong customer [indecipherable], solid past performance and innovative capabilities into new wins with the navy and won a new $110 million platform modernization effort focused on radar and ew systems and subsystems. lastly, we secured a $61 million recompete supporting the dod's irregular warfare technical support directorate with technical and analytical services. as a result of these bookings, our backlog exiting the quarter stood at $10.1 billion, which represents 8% growth year-over-year. approximately $1.4 billion of our backlog is funded.
as kevin mentioned earlier, we are steadily submitting proposals, and our proposals awaiting adjudications stands at $8 billion. we have routinely spoken to the investments we are making in the business to sharpen our differentiation. adding to our differentiators, i am pleased that we have recently announced a strategic partnership with google cloud to jointly pursue cloud and analytics opportunities across the federal market. we look forward to leveraging the success we have enjoyed to date into new customers and use cases. this adds to our growing list of partnerships with leading commercial technology providers and, quite frankly, further demonstrates mantech's position as a trusted partner in federal digital transformation and it modernization efforts.
these partnerships are receiving the validation of both our customers and partners. a few months ago, we were awarded the best dod solution by red hat for leveraging their hybrid cloud and open source technology solutions. we were selected for this honor based on our innovative use of the red hat openshift container platform in support of the u.s. army's persistent cyber training environment. we are excited with the progress we have made and look forward to continue helping our customers leverage best-of-breed commercial technologies in support of their missions.
with that, let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president
thanks, matt. in closing, let me emphasize that we remain focused on executing and innovating for our customers; attracting, developing and retaining talent; and leveraging the balance sheet to deliver strong long-term shareholder value. i want to reiterate my thanks to the team for their unwavering commitment to our customers and their critical missions.
with that, we are ready to take your questions.
",2021-Q1,MANT
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from matt akers of wells fargo. please go ahead.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for the question. i wanted to just ask on the margins, and if there is anything else behind sort of the uptick in margins. i know what you see there, your still off from kind of the normal pace a little bit. was that all that it was or was there anything sort of one-time that you would point to in that?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there were no real large one-time items, it continues to be the lower oec volume and the reduced indirect spend, is still not caught up, back to kind of the pre-covid levels.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. okay. and i guess like, thinking about how that will trend, here going over the next couple of quarters, is it fair to assume, q3 is kind of more back to normal than q4 is kind of fully back or just kind of like the way to think about the pacing of the rest of the year?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, yeah. we're clearly projecting lower margins in the second half of the year, some of that is a return to normal spend and some of it is just because of our high percentage of cost plus, we're actually trying to uptick some of our r&d spending and other investments like that, that won't be necessarily recurring in nature, but are within our current indirect freight budgets for the year.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, got it. thanks, that's helpful. if i could do one more. i guess that, can you touch on kind of the intelligence business in general? and i think some of your peers, it sounds like maybe have seen a little bit of a slowdown there recently, is that something that you guys are seeing as well?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so, i think at least for us, and maybe some of those questions all speak to, i'll say tied to some of the disruptions overall. but i'd say portions of our portfolio, overall, we're seeing a little bit of delays in the intel side of the business versus say the others in terms of defense and federal civilian, just kind of i'll give you the overarching commentary there.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. okay, that's helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt sharpe of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
kevin, judy, matt, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. judy, i just wanted to touch on the organic growth rate cadence here for a moment. i believe, q1 was about 1%. it looks like this quarter more or less was along those lines and you reiterated the guidance range, which correct me if i'm wrong, had 5% embedded in it at the mid point.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so looking at the q3, q4, its inflection in q3 or is this more of q4 weighted? and sort of what's driving the back-end weighting profile, is this odc surge or what can you tell me about it, to get me comfortable with that, that inflection in the coming quarters?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it's a combination of things, i would say, the biggest is related to some of those odc catch-ups kind of ramping q3 and then even more so in q4, as well as just the volume of proposals outstanding, where we're hopeful that the government will stay on pace and we'll see a good q3 of adjudications that will potentially drive some growth in q4, going into q2, sorry, into 2022.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
it's kevin. let me expand a little bit on that. if you look at the $10 billion of proposals outstanding, at the end of last year, that number was $6 billion for the company. and for the first half of this year, there's two trends that we've seen. one is, an increasing demand as well as -- resulting submissions of proposals by the customers, meaning that they asked for us to provide and compete on bids, is not going down, it's gone up. at the same time, the amount of adjudications in raw dollars over the first six months of this year has not stayed at the levels that did for the last two years. so that's -- that adjudication part is reflective of some delays, that we think is from covid, the choppiness. but you put those two together, there is just a lot of proposals out there that we think are nearing the end of their adjudication cycle, and we'll expect to see outcomes from those -- booked from here and taken across the industry as a result of that pickup.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then just on the cash balance and m&a, it looks like if you did nothing else other than services the dividend, as well as the remainder of the revolver outstanding, you'd end the year with more or less a $150 million in cash on the books, and i think with the revision to your credit facility, you've got another 1.1 [phonetic] or so in terms of dry powder. so how are you guys thinking about m&a flow here in the coming quarters, and in particular, any commentary around deal size?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah, i'll start and then judy can add. generally, we've seen an uptick in assets that are available in the market this year at all sizes. it just feels very busy in 2021. and so we are active, but also the debt availability is there and it's a very good time, and very good terms to be able to be in position to have that capacity should we find the right fit. and we still stay disciplined, the multiples was fairly elevated, but it's a good time in the market to have that capacity available, which is why we work that, and did a great job on that. take a bow.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. as kevin said, it was time to kind of do the amend and extend m&a market, crazy, lots of things, so we just felt like it was a good time to have extra capacity should we find the right, larger opportunities that makes sense, we'll be ready to go.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then just one more, if i may. kevin, i think you had mentioned that some of your forward deployed staff that were previously in afghanistan might have been redeployed within the region. can you just maybe tell us if you're seeing any opportunities associated with sort of an over horizon capability or what you've been able to redeploy those bodies to?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so, matt, this is matt. i'll feel that maybe initially here, and from a dod perspective, our presence within afghanistan now is complete. and i can't really give you the specifics about where our folks have been a redeployed, but they have been in support of the national security missions that we do support overseas.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
and now i'll add to that at a very high level. we are a mission and tactical edge company, and some of the investments we're making around r&d and technology relate to our ability to support deployed forces, deployed systems and that's an area that's got a heavy amount of focus within the dod writ large, based on the change, i'll call it a generational change in the strategy from priority counterterrorism to priority countering near-peer threats. and how that plays out in terms of funding and activity, will play out over time. but there is a very real and compelling need and we can sense that in the customers. so we'll see how it plays out in terms of our support, but we've supported these locations for decades, we're proud to do that and we'll continue to do that.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks so much. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gautam khanna of cowen. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
yes, thank you. i was wondering if -- i know it's early, but would you mind giving us some color on what you think the medium-term or longer-term organic growth rate may trend to be for mantech? i know we're coming off of a big year and we got the pass through dynamic, but i'm just curious like based on what's in your pipeline, what you see the national security needs as being? and just putting it all together, is it a low-to-mid single-digit organic business medium-term or how do you think about it?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think in general, the pipeline shows that we've got lots of opportunities out there that we're pursuing. as you said, it's early to start talking about longer-term. our goal is always to grow a little bit faster than the budget. and so we're feeling good about it, but it's, there is $10 billion proposals out there, and it just is going to depend on how many fall our way.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
judy, could you refresh us on sort of the recompete rate, next -- or maybe over the next 18 months as we think about the $10 billion.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. there is not a lot of impact remaining in 2021 from recompetes. we've got about 90% plus in backlog, with the balance kind of evenly split between recompete and new. next year i think in general is a relatively average 20% to 25% recompete, but it's a little more front-end loaded in the year than we've seen in the last few years.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from robert spingarn of credit suisse. your line is open.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, thank you. kevin, you talked about mantech's zero-trust capabilities, and this is obviously a big focus for this administration. can you describe what mantech brings to the table? and do you have any partnerships from the leading vendors there, may be a crowdstrike or cloudflare? i think that both of them have talked about ramping their federal business meaningfully.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah, great question, and thanks. i'll talk about both. we're supporting the federal government in operating in a contested cyber environment, right. that's got the full breadth of cyber operations to cyber defense. we've done that for a long time in terms of both sides of that, and policies have and will continue to change in focus on that. the cyber defense piece is moving toward -- zero-trust architecture is moving to the cloud, there is a lot behind that through the executive order that came out. we have within the cyber r&d and investments that we've made, focused on zero-trust as a core component and within the business, as a business, we've also -- we're also, i'd say almost complete with the implementation of the zero-trust architecture within our own environment, not planning execution and we're almost done with that. so you put those two together, we think that those combined offer at least a path for customers to know it can be done, how it can be done, and also we have strong capabilities that matt can expand upon around how we would do that and with the clients and customers, as well as partners that we have.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yeah, and i would say that, just to add on to kevin's commentary, that we actually have -- we don't typically talk about the specifics of the partnerships that we have, but we have a wide breadth of partnerships across the zero-trust landscape. and we're involved in, i'll just say multiple areas of discussions with customers around zero-trust. and this aligns, it's a great question, because it really aligns great with our -- the technical focus areas we have within our 2023 strategy and where we're investing. to kevin's point, it aligns with, i'll say, innovations that people are looking for, but also i'll say reasonable innovation, where everyone gets sold, the next best thing on zero-trust. so it's us helping them as the independent technology-agnostic partner to help sort that out to get to real solutions.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
do you see a particular timeframe when this really ramps?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
gosh, i've never been good at for prognosticating the pace of the federal government, but the one thing, robert, that i would say is that, the government is in earnest in these conversations, where in the past, it was more -- it was i would say not as urgent a dialog. so i think that there is a pace to which they want to act upon, and it's just, and so i think the urgency there and then we'll see in terms of it, but in terms of, this isn't a the case of whether they want to do it or not, it's just a case of them getting through their own acquisition processes to make it happen.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
it is kevin. i think if you read the executive order, the government has been very clear on what they suggest agencies prioritize. and that guidance as it relates to the response to the executive order, how it's going to flow is very important, but it will also guide these different agencies as to how they're going to do it, once funding is afforded in available, and you can see an attempt to establish more funding to make that available and make the changes necessary.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. well, thank you for that. just a quick one for judy. really on the ebitda margin, i want to just look at a little bit to the right and see if you think the expansion can continue next year? or does it -- does the renormalization of some of the costs like pto and travel, kind of limit that opportunity relative to this year?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think we outperformed last year. we're on track to outperform this year, clearly it's something that we're focused on, trying to continue to do, we've said in the past 10 basis points, 15 basis points a year. hard to say today, given the 2021 outperform that we'll be able to do that in '22, but it's clearly a focus.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. well, thank you for that. appreciate the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian kinstlinger of alliance global partners. please go ahead.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. you mentioned you've got 90% of the midpoint of revenue guidance coming from backlog for the remainder of the year, i think. how does that compare to the past at this point in the year and how was potential hiring difficulties, ramp delays, and i guess award delays factored into that?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. hi, brian, it's i think the -- yeah, just to clarify, the 90% is for the full-year, not the second half of the year. so, obviously, the first half of the year now is all backlog. so if you're looking at just the second half of the year, it's a little bit higher percentage coming from new and recompete. and as far as how it compares to prior years, it might be a little bit better off, but usually by this point in time, you kind of have one what you're going to win that's going to have any kind of major impact on the revenue in the year.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
right. that was why i asked that. okay. and the only other follow-up, a small number of questions. i missed, if you said what new business was, of that 800 in change of awards?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so this is matt. the recompetes, add-ons and contract extensions with the majority of the bookings for the quarter.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
got it. okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tobey sommer of truist securities. your line is open.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good evening, everyone. this is jasper bibb on for tobey. one of your competitors said last week that the majority of their employees will adopt some form of hybrid work over time. i was just curious, what do you think their service delivery could look like long-term and what that would mean for your recruiting margins etc.?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. so this is matt. i'll just start off. so we've been doing, obviously, the war on talent has not ended. so we're very sensitive to that. we have our mobility program, which has hit record numbers this year in terms of where enablement of our folks, and i could spend 20 minutes talking to you about all the career enablement things we're doing. but the key for us is that, i mentioned in my comments, just around flexibility, with the -- we have a wide variety of customers that some want, i'll say a 100% remote and others that want a 100% on-site. and so we're working through that, as well as for our -- each of our employees in terms of what experience and career enablement they want to have. and i think the phrase that we really use to sum that up was, we really want our folks to be the best version of themselves. and so we're going to be working with them to make sure that they can do that within the context of the pandemic and the things as our customers are, i'll say changing their requirements or updating their requirements for remote work.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. and then, i just want to get your thoughts on what wage inflation might mean for the business based on your contract mix? how might that impact margins? and is that potentially a tailwind for the cost plus portfolio, if your customers are willing to pay out for the best it or cyber talent?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, that's definitely an area where having the high percentage of cost plus work is to our benefit. so they are willing to pay those higher costs. but that said, it's still very competitive market, both on a bidding standpoint as well as a hiring standpoint.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, last question for me. i just wanted -- well, there seems to be a pretty dynamic environment responding to delta. now, have you seen any customers putting capacity when that's back in place, have skipped workers, is there kind of any expectation that that might happen in the coming months?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah, we are not seeing that. i think the general guidance is we want you to show up the -- we want to make sure you're vaccinated. we want to strongly encourage as best we can, your vaccinated, and if you're not, we're asking that you take a lot of precautions, and we're going to help you take those precautions. and in terms of not only doing math, but testing. so we'll see how it all plays out, but the guidance generally is, a fair amount of the citizens, have at least one shot, but we still have a surge going on, and let's work through this and try not to shut down things if we can [indecipherable] of it.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mariana perez mora of bank of america. your line is open.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. hello. so my question is on cyber security. we see a lot of commentary around how cyber security is important for -- to national security, we have seen cyber security funding included in most of the deals that we have seen recently. but then, how should we think about the timing from those, -- ideas for funding to become like budget to become contract and plus probably become something that is reflected in your organic growth?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah, it's a great question, and thanks. look, there's a lot of -- like any major change, it starts with policy level changes as well as incremental funding and reprioritization of funding, and basically in that order. and you can tell that there's a lot of policy level discussion with the new national cyber director and all the activities that's going on, that will inform where the funding goes. that said, there is already an increase in unclassified budget for cyber, so you can see there's beginning for prioritization, same thing for it infrastructure renewal, and we think that, that will be consistent, but it's hard to say where it will line up against other priorities. but directionally, i think that the ship is moving in one direction, it's a matter of when and how those priorities lay out over time.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
but when you do your internal planning, do you see this as a short-term boost or more like it could be years for these to actually become top line growth?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
i think certain program is going to be a short-term boost, but the bulk of it is going to be longer-term mission requirements and changes that have to be funded and procured. so it's a mixture of both, but more and more of this will be more persistent in terms of the obligations and allocations toward it.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
interesting. and then, have you seen, given these trends like new entrants into the business, how hard it is to get like -- to compete?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
we don't see a lot of new entrants in this. the areas that we're -- that you're talking about, our -- i mean there is -- it's a high bar of entry, to be able to do this -- the type of work that we do.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect. and last one, not related to this, more like next opportunities. would you mind giving us some color on what is the new work that you mentioned in the qualified pipeline of opportunities? what is that related, where does it come from or timing that we should look at?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah. appreciate the questions. so we have been positioning as we mentioned with our investments to be able to kind of predict where the market is and go after some of these procurements of all sizes, but more larger procurements as well, as prime contractor. and we have been able to put together teams and compete and put in strong bids. i think that we're on the playing field competing for some of these larger deals across our different components of our business, intel, defense and federal civilian. and so, i can't point to any one specific area. but if you think about cyber, think about enterprise it, analytics and automation as well as remote computing, and data at the edge support, and systems engineering, all those are areas that we are expanding into and competing more routinely.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you very much. thanks.

okay. for you, matt, particularly, your bookings were particularly strong from classified customers, i believe, you and kevin may have said that 55% of bookings came from classified. would you say that the intelligence community demand for your services and general award activity is back to 2019 levels or almost back to 2019 levels after all of the disruption associated with the pandemic and administration transition?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so, i would say there is still some delays in the intel sector, and not necessarily from the administration changes, but more from the pandemic. but, there is funding there, but it's just a matter of, like kevin talked about earlier, the pace of -- what you have coming back in mass and getting things through. so it's a bit of a throughput issue that they're working through.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
sounds good. and also related to classified spending, the intelligence community seems to be accelerating investments in its cloud computing architecture with the amazon c2s, the successor c2e that was awarded last year and the recently awarded wild and stormy. from a high level perspective, are migrations to the cloud a significant growth area for mantech in terms of classified and non-classified customers? and if amazon, microsoft or others win a large federal contract as a prime, are you often involved as a subcontractor for like these large cloud implementations?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yeah, so writ large, while we didn't mention cloud specifically within the five technical focus areas, it's like electricity for us, which is -- it's a part of all the things that you do. it's kind of hard not to do the types of work and the innovations that we want without being cloud enabled. and so we do work with all of the csps and do support a lot of the activities there. i know we've had recent press releases on certain relationships and so i think this new unclass and class, that part of our go-to-market is not going to be changed -- is not changing in a good way, meaning that we are investing in that, we do see opportunities across the patch. but we don't want to lead with cloud, we want to lead with solutions, right. our customers really want us to solve their problems, and so this is an -- these are enabling technologies that we are investing in to make sure that we can be technology-agnostic, given the right answer. and it is kevin. i'll just follow on that briefly. there's tactical cloud support, there's mission, and i think service rate [indecipherable] level cloud and there's enterprise level, and all of those are focus areas for our customers and are going to be areas that we'll seek concentrated movement over time in terms of just creating that foundational element up and down the overall decision making stack, if you want to call it.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to the mantech second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call.
[operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to your -- over to stephen vather, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
welcome everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's second quarter call. joining me today is kevin phillips, our chairman, ceo and president; judy bjornaas, our cfo; and matt tait, our coo.
during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call.
on today's call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our second quarter earnings release.
with that, let me hand the call over to kevin.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
thanks, steven, and good afternoon, everyone. i'd like to start the call today by thanking the entire mantech team for their unwavering dedication to our customers and their critical missions. the steadfast focus enabled another quarter of strong results, including record profitability. we also saw strong q2 bookings, which were driven by successful outcomes on the recompete front, as well as new awards, and contract extensions and expansions.
we exited the quarter with nearly $10 billion in proposals outstanding, another company record. this includes both a significant level of new business opportunities, but also a higher than average level of recompetes. this activity demonstrates the healthy demand we are seeing from customers for our differentiated services and solutions across the business. the market environment remained uneven throughout most of the quarter. however, we are seeing signs of incremental improvement as customers are increasingly returning to normalized operations. collectively, these trends reflect the impact from pandemic related disruptions, which have created a choppy and somewhat slower pace of awards in year-to-date 2021.
exiting the quarter and through the balance of the year, we see and expect a robust level of proposal submissions, and the current velocity suggests that we may exceed last year's volume. the volume of adjudications combined with our ability to continue to take market share will be the key driver for our anticipated bookings and acceleration of revenue growth in the second half of '21 and into next year. overall, we are seeing strong market demand across the majority of our business, and we expect that to continue throughout the second half of this year.
turning to the defense budget environment. congress appears to be making good progress on the fy '22 appropriations. however, given the fulsome legislative agenda, we expect to begin the year under a continuing resolution. since our q1 call, we have received administrations detailed budget, which continues to demonstrate clear alignment between national priorities and mantech's areas of focus. this is a reflection of the actions we have taken to continuously position our business for success.
for example, cyber remains a top priority and the budget calls for over $20 billion unclassified spending across defense and federal civilian customers, which represents nearly 9% growth year-over-year. cyber demand remains evident across a broad range of capabilities. we see a strong focus on zero-trust architectures and cyber operations, both areas where we have differentiated solutions and capabilities.
the budget also calls for over $97 billion of unclassified it modernization, representing 4% growth year-over-year. the continued it modernization push across the federal government also aligns with mantech's investments and capabilities in analytics, automation, data at the edge and other key technologies, enabling both mission and enterprise operations.
finally, intelligence community spending remained steady at nearly $86 billion, and we still have ample market opportunity in this area.
lastly, i want to note that the drawdown of u.s. military presence in afghanistan remains on track. all mantech personnel supporting dod programs in that country, have already shifted into other regions. mantech has proudly supported the department of defense for multiple decades at the tactical edge. we look forward to continued support for our customers in their global missions and are monitoring how their needs are evolving and the implications that it has for our programs and employees.
now, judy will walk through details on our q2 financial performance and outlook. judy?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kevin. we continued our steady execution in the quarter with a focus on generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. quarterly revenue grew to $649 million, up 3% compared to q2 of 2020. direct labor moderated some in the quarter with the return to normalized pto usage and the impact of the additional federal holiday.
for q2, prime contracts comprised 93% of revenue and the breakout of contract pricing structure was approximately 69% cost-plus, 18% fixed price and 13% time and material. q2 ebitda was $67 million, up 19% from q2 of 2020. this resulted in an ebitda margin of 10.4%, up a 150 basis points year-over-year, as margins continue to benefit from stronger labor mix and continued lower indirect cost spending.
net income for the quarter was $37 million and diluted eps was $0.89, up 22% and 20% from q2 2020, respectively. adjusted net income was $40 million and adjusted diluted eps was $0.99, up 19% and 18% from last year. our effective tax rate was 24.2% in the quarter, in line with expectations.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. cash flow from operations of $75 million in the quarter, represented 2 times net income. days sales outstanding were 64 days, an increase of one day compared to q2 of 2020. at quarter-end, the balance sheet showed $65 million in cash and $30 million of debt. additionally, we distributed $15 million in dividends in q2, maintaining steady return of cash to shareholders.
the board has authorized us to continue our current cash dividend of $0.38 per share to be paid in september. we also recently amended and extended our $500 million revolving credit facility and added $600 million in capacity through a delayed-draw term loan. mantech is taking advantage of favorable debt capital markets and positioning the company with significant flexibility for capital deployment going forward.
as consistently stated, our capital deployment remains focused on m&a, and we are continuing to actively review opportunities in a very busy market. we remain focused on transactions that bolster our capabilities, expand our customer portfolio and that best position the company to generate long-term value.
moving on to guidance. we are reiterating our previously communicated revenue guidance and increasing our guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps. we will continue to evaluate our expected go-forward results, which we believe are most impacted by several factors. these include the rate at which we are able to successfully win new business and retain recompetes, as well as the timing of each, the pace of hiring and ramping new and recent contract awards, and the level and timing of material procurements, as well as the cadence of the normalization of the supply chain.
our revenue guidance remains $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion, representing 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. at the midpoint of guidance, a little over 90% of the revenue is expected to come from existing backlog. we are increasing the outlook for adjusted net income to be in the range of $146.5 million to $151.1 million, with adjusted diluted eps of $3.57 to $3.68. we are also increasing our expected ebitda margin for the year to be 9.3% to 9.4%, which represents a 20 basis point to 30 basis point improvement over 2020.
year-to-date margins have been running higher than the full-year guide, so we anticipate greater volume of lower fee bearing odcs, higher and more normalized indirect spending from the acceleration of expenses related to business development and m&a efforts, as well as increased travel and pto utilization in the second half of 2021.
the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps ranges assume an effective tax rate of approximately 24% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 41 million shares.
finally, cash flow from operations is still expected to be at least $200 million, with capital expenditures expected to be around 2.5% of revenue for the year.
now, i will turn it over to matt to cover the business development and operational highlights for the quarter.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thank you, judy. we achieved bookings of $813 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1.3 times in q2. some specific highlights from the quarter include, winning a $100 million contract to continue providing the navy with range sustainability services for training and test ranges to meet military readiness and environmental requirements. we also won an $86 million contract to continue providing cloud engineering, devsecops and enterprise it for the u.s. cis global enterprise. finally, we secured a new $85 million contract to provide the state department with enterprise it, training, technology deployment and communications services that support global consular affairs operations.
these contract awards continue to demonstrate the differentiation and strength of mantech's capabilities in mission and enterprise it and systems engineering. additionally, 55% of contract awards in the quarter came from classified customers.
as a result of these bookings, our total backlog was $10.2 billion at quarter-end, representing 10% year-over-year growth with funded backlog at $1.4 billion. we are pleased with the progress we have made during the quarter. we look forward to continuing to drive strong results in the back half of 2021, as we help our customers leverage best of breed commercial technologies in support of their missions.
our success and ability to deliver for customers remain squarely driven by talented employees. we have increased our commitment to attracting developing and retaining talent, in what has become an even more competitive labor market. we have been hard at work, ensuring we have best-in-class, highly skilled, and highly clear talent in order to deliver our leading solutions. we remain focused on our objective to be the employer of choice in our industry, which is why we are evolving and improving how our team operates, advocating for flexibility to maximize employee success, satisfaction and productivity in a new normal.
over the past few years, we have made significant investments bolstering our capabilities and positioning the business in alignment with national priorities, including cyber, enterprise it, digital and platform modernization, analytics and other key areas, all of which, as kevin mentioned, are showing steady demand. overall, i am confident that mantech's service offerings across its various businesses have positioned us to continue to win.
our focus on driving continued innovation and differentiation is positioning mantech to maximize pipeline conversion into revenue growth. we expect to harvest the benefit of those investments in the quarters to come.
with that, let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
thanks, matt. in closing, our results this quarter reflect the efforts by our team to drive strong program execution, innovation and attract and develop best-in-class talent. at the same time, we remained focused on leveraging our strong balance sheet to deliver long-term shareholder value, while supporting our customers and their critical missions.
we are now ready to take your questions.
",2021-Q2,MANT
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions]. our first question is from matt akers from wells fargo. your line is now open.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. hi. thanks. good afternoon. i wonder if you could comment a little bit more on kind of the slowdown in intel. and specifically, i guess, what do you think needs to happen for that business to start coming back again? i mean does your customer need to add staff to kind of get through some of those contracts or the new -- or funding? or what do you think will lead us to sort of get out of that slowdown you're seeing?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes. it's kevin. i'll speak in and then if matt wants to add, he can. the government and the intel community has needs, they are persistent. but what we found is the timing of their ability to send out awards or make the adjudications continue to be impacted by a combination of covid coming back open, coming back in and then having to shut down again when they physically have to be in the office to do that role as well as staffing constraints, within their organization. it's a little bit of both. it's not about the budget of the mission requirements. it's more about a combination of their ability to do their job and get outcomes in a timely fashion where that has definitely been disrupted in the intelligence community over the last 18 months.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. and then i guess if i could do one more, just on griffin. are you able to comment kind of what multiple you paid for that? or maybe just in general, sort of what -- how kind of competitive that deal is or what you're seeing just in terms of kind of multiples for m&a in the space in general?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i think we paid a market multiple for comparable assets, and we're really focused on being able to leverage that -- the systems engineering, digital engineering capabilities across the enterprise.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
and i'll add. look, we're excited about the combination of griffin and match. we have a heavy navy presence, but this is very complementary. the type of work they do are naval surface and the combination of their investments about systems engineering, digital engineering and data analytics, along with what we've invested in, i think, offer a very compelling view of how we're going to support the navy as the shift to the pacific continues. so we're pretty excited about that coming together and what we can do going forward against the new near peer threat focus.
matt akers -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt sharpe from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
kevin, judy, matt. good afternoon. congrats on the griffin deal. judy, just a question on the revenue guide down of about $140 million. i was wondering if you could maybe parse that between how much is tied to, say, the intel community and how much is tied to the supply chain? and is the revision reflective of a deterioration in your business environment? or is it more just challenges that are persisting longer than expected?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think it's more the challenge is taking longer than we expected. i mean, the odcs, we had fully expected those to return to the levels we were expecting in 2021 in the second half of the year, and we're just not seeing that. as far as bookings, we did see some adjudications in the fed civil business for some of the larger bids we went after. and unfortunately, we were unsuccessful there, and we had assumed that the intel market would return. so basically, any kind of new business we have built into the second half of the year. now for the most part, we have derisked out of our guide. and then just i think the afghan and sustainment work came on a little bit faster and was a little bit larger than we were expecting.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
it's kevin. i'll add about persistence because there is one persistent area, and that's the military support around fuel up sustainment in afghan. so that is fairly quick. in terms of the drawdown, that's the low single-digit. but there's also u.s.-based support for systems that have supported that region for a long time. and if you look from 2020 to 2022 over a two-year period, the oco work as well as some of these systems that are going to be reducing significantly in terms of funding. they're, in total, high single-digit combination revenue headwinds, more heavily weighted toward the back half of this year and into next year. now that's -- it's a good thing to support those programs. we've done that for decades. but you can see that the military is definitely shifting its focus as a result of that drawdown in terms of their support for some of these systems as well.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
and i'll also add, matt, we do think, though, that like the fundamental strategy that we have moved to in 2023, i mean those things are getting funded in the right way. we still see opportunities there to be able to grow our business long term.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then kevin, just on some of your introductory remarks around covid-19. i'd like to think you sort of alluded to the risk tied to the december eight vaccination mandate. are you able to provide any context around what the risk might be to the back end of this year and into next year, either by way of a percentage of employees that are currently unvaccinated or otherwise? or how should we think about the risk associated with the eo?
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
that's a really hard thing to determine. we have over 85% of our workforce has received shots and is clear to the paperwork that's needed to do that. and it continues to trend in the right direction fairly quickly given that time line. that said, we don't have everybody we need yet. and how that plays out as we get closer to that date and what exemptions are allowed under what construct by each of our customers, all have to come together to get to the total risk. but if it's already a tight labor market, anything above zero is a risk that we think is important to note.
matt sharpe -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks. got in pack to the q.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen. your line is now open.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
hi. i was wondering if you could put it all together on the known headwinds for next year. and so i heard about low single-digit decline from the withdrawal from afghanistan. so whatever that is $50 million or something to the top line. and then i heard something about a high single-digit decline in some other related business. but i just wondered if you could aggregate the known headwinds. and then if you could also, in that five percent number for next year, how big is griffin? how much of a backfill is that? and how large is it? anything you can give us so we can model this correctly.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes. it's me, kevin, just a high level. so when i say the high single-digit, that's a combination of both afghan and field sustainment work. so that's in total going into next year about traditional military sustainment work. we generally view that the odc and supply chain risk in terms of the upward option around that as well as the new business from intelligence are likely going to be pushed to where the growth from them or the second half of the year. so we're being cautious about any growth from those in the first half. and then we have end-of-life programs. so those are in aggregate. and i think we're going to have to wait, and i think -- judy, until february, to talk about the overall composition. is that correct?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. we just wanted to kind of throw out some guardrails around 2022, given the headwinds and the acquisition to kind of level set and then in february, as kevin just mentioned, we'll be able to go until that -- we'll have a lot clearer picture on what 2020 is going to look like.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. could you give us a sense for how large griffin is at the top line?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i mean right now, we haven't projected it to be into -- in 2021 guidance. but if it were to close in early december, we would see low- to mid-20 revenue kind of on a monthly basis, if you want to look at that range for kind of a run rate into 2022.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. thank you. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian kinstlinger from alliance global partners. your line is now open.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. thank you. can you share any plan you have to fulfill positions? obviously, the tight labor market, assuming the unvaccinated can't work on a program. the plan to replace them, how difficult is that? what is the wages like right now for hiring staff? and then can you keep employees if they can't be deployed into programs in order to protect margins?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. this is matt. i'll -- that's a kind of multi-threaded question there. but let me kind of start with what we're doing for our employees, which is we're -- everything is customer-based. so federal civilian versus defense versus intel, all have unique requirements as we're going through that. so we're being very proactive with our employee population, trying to make sure that we're giving them every opportunity to be able to either get an accommodation or continue to work with mantech. so we have plans in place to do that. we also have proactively placed -- we have analytics on our own staff, right? so we have proactively looked at certain areas where we're hiring maybe ahead of where there could be some issues from a hiring perspective. to answer your question around the wage inflation item.
i don't think we've really seen that yet. i mean, maybe just a hair, but i don't think that's -- our concern really, is really over the immediate future of the december eight date and trying to make sure we work through that. although, we are fortunate in that we do have flexible customers who will work with us through these kinds of issues. and obviously, we have a majority of cost plus work. so in some ways that can benefit us and allow us to work through this maybe in a way that others cannot.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. my follow-up, first, you mentioned attrition being an issue. where is attrition these days compared to historically? and then a follow-up on the griffin. is there ebitda margin similar to mantech's? maybe just a quick comparison would be helpful. thank you so much.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so i'll get the turnover and then judy hand it over to you. so on the -- so what we're really just seeing is, i think, a turnover going back to what i would call pre-pandemic normal levels from a turnover perspective.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and then from a margin standpoint, the full impact of griffin is in that 94% to 95% range that it is the early look to 2022. and i would say, in general, the program margins are in line with our -- the rest of our dod business.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tobey sommer from truist securities. your line is now open.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. similar in vein to some of the preceding questions. could you talk to us about wage inflation, which is probably the primary aspect of inflation that's relevant to your business? and what a faster pace of wage inflation would mean to your ability to grow [indecipherable] organically, either make it easier or harder? and preserve or expand margins, either make it harder or make it easier.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
it's kevin, let me just make a comment and then if matt wants to add. look, when we have high demand for the right talent and the customer sets and wage inflation, if it does start increasing above an amount that can't be built in or is already built into escalation that we can manage between each program, we often go to customers and there's flexibility in going through those discussions because of the need for the talent. i mean that's something that we've mutually and across the industry come to learn to work through. it's a matter of how much that escalation is. so we'll have to see how it plays out. again, matt has mentioned that it really isn't something we've seen that is creating a level of concern that you would want us to speak to, but we are tracking it just given the overall market today and all -- there's also the potential impact of vaccination, if any.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
and could you comment about what you -- i guess i got -- we got some comments about your expectations into 2022. in the context of a continuing resolution, does your initial sort of, guardrails as you put it for 2022, does that contemplate a cr extending into the first quarter? and if so, how long into?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i think we've kind of taken that into account, obviously, a government shutdown is not taken into account. but yes, i don't think given the timing that we're looking at for new business and things like that, that a cr continuing is not going to meaningfully change what we have thrown out for those guardrails.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and then last question for me is sort of on the recruiting front, just kind of delving into that a little bit more. are you doing anything different in your recruiting activities, either something that comes in like perhaps utilizing more outsourced providers to try to land the talents? or is the recipe that you've historically used to attract and retain talent largely the same?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so i would say overall -- so we already will supplement with outside resources in certain areas where we need that. so we -- that's always something as a lever that we use. so i would say from -- while we might be doing more of that right now, i would say the processes that we are using and the approach is still the same.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you.our next question comes from the line of mariana perez mora from bank of america. your line is now open.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
good afternoon. my question is going to be regarding the intel work environment. it's been 18 months. and what i would like to understand is from your point of view and your conversation with customers, how long do you think it will take for them to actually get back to normal, burn enough inventories or backlog of awards they have? and can any of the programs you are exposed to die or be obsolete by the time that we are able to award them?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so i think on this, we really don't expect them to really -- it's still going to be several quarters. i think the back half of 2022 is what we are anticipating for that, to answer your question.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
and then what makes you feel comfortable that they'll get back there? and i know you have like -- you can give little bit information, but any color that you can provide us to understand why you feel comfortable that they'll get back to those levels, and this is not just a new normal?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. yes, without -- like you said, that's speaking on their behalf. i think the things that we are seeing is there are -- the return to the workforce because of the vaccine mandate is actually bringing more people into the business now. so there is an uptick in what i would call a normal workflow. not that they're there yet, but that they're getting there. so that's why you are starting to see more signs of that.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then i'll switch gears to the federal civilian segment. you mentioned that your win rate was lower than expected. can you give us some color if it was like pricing capabilities? and what's the strategy going forward?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. on federal civilian, so really, we've had a great win rate there over the last couple of years, and so we wanted to go after some bigger opportunities. and what we really need to do -- and so -- and those didn't pan out and what we really just need to do there is focus on our customer intimacy, i think. but we do have a good pipeline moving forward in federal civilian. it's just unfortunate that some of the competitive, new opportunities that new customers did not work out in our favor.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from louie dipalma from william blair. your line is now open.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
kevin, matt, judyand steven, good evening.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
good evening.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
matt, you mentioned how your intelligence community bookings as a percentage of total bookings have recently only been 25%, whereas previously, they were approximately 50%. as it relates to this topic, are you maintaining your win rate and your prevailing market share? or have you seen any fluctuations in that regard?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
i think -- so i think the overall industry is seeing delays. so i think from a market share perspective, i don't feel like we're losing anything at this point. we feel -- we like the future of where the opportunity pipeline that we do have within intel and that we expect to continue to retain the recompetes and be consistent with our win rates and market averages like they have been in the past.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great. and also related to the prior answer. on the business development commentary, you also mentioned that you were unsuccessful for several large civil program pursuits. do you need to make more acquisitions to be successful on these larger programs? was there anything specific that you were lacking? we know that booz allen obviously, recently acquired liberty it and they acquired like low-code, no-code talent for software development. is there any particular skill set, whether it's data analytics, software development, artificial intelligence, cloud computing that you feel you are lacking? or like was there any specific error analysis that you can point to for these awards? thanks.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. so i think -- so we were not lacking in any capabilities, and we will continue to leverage both organic investment and m&a as appropriate to advance our business within federal civilian as well as across the entire business. i think for us, these were newer customers. and so we are kind of refocusing and making sure we have better customer intimacy moving forward.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great. and for these large civil program pursuits, are they more price competitive? is -- like could you point to the fact that like perhaps those vendors that won the programs were willing to take a lower margin? or is there an intense price competition for like very large civil programs?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
so i think there's always price competition within -- not just federal civilian, but across the market. so -- but that -- i would call that a normal competitive pressure, not something -- like if you're asking relative to lpta, what we're really not seeing -- i mean we see that in a couple of places, but that -- the pendulum has not swung back to that within the market.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
okay. yes, i was just referring to how -- like it seems like as it relates to ultra large it and cloud contracts that there's a lot of competition taking place between leidos and general dynamics it and peraton and saic and caci, and it seems for these mega contracts that there's -- it's intensely price competitive, and it might be difficult for mantech to break into those types of contracts, given how a lot of those providers have a lot of heritage with these mega it/cloud contract. so i was wondering if there's like any deficiency in terms of scale or if it's just like the margins on those types of contracts are unappealing to you?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. no, i think that from a -- i'll say, from a pricing perspective, we've been able to be competitive with all of those folks for those types of opportunity sets. and that's our expectation, it's to be a competitive in that -- within those environments as well as others. within the federal civilian, we are -- as you said, right, we're looking to expand our footprint. but i think for us, what we have found is we do have the capabilities. the customers have recognized those. we do have the right pricing and capability there to be competitive. and for us, it's just -- like, to your point, these are newer areas that we are working to get into. and so that is where we're working on the customer intimacy aspect of that.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
i'll also add that we're more cautious on the mega enterprise it deals in terms of how many we go after, to your point.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
right.
louie dipalma -- william blair -- analyst
great.that make sense. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen. your line is now open.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
hi. just a follow-up, if you don't mind. i was wondering this year, how far the odc shortfalls were relative to the initial guidance? and then just -- because there are a lot of moving pieces like you mentioned. so how much was odcs if you were to -- just odcs? [indecipherable] just relative to last quarter, this quarter, next quarter.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we're not going to go into the specifics of the number, but i do think -- as i mentioned, we were expecting it to accelerate in the second half of the year, and it didn't. so it's one of the components that resulted in the revision of the 2021 guidance.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
judy, does it -- does the absence of odcs, whether it be routers or whatever, impair the company's ability to actually ramp direct labor? is there like a secondary impact because until you have the product, you can't execute the work? i'm just curious, like, is that also maybe one of the knock-on effects or not?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, i'll let matt take a -- answer that.
matt tait -- chief operating officer
sure. i mean there is a little bit of labor that goes with that. but i think when we're expecting, gautam, to your question, supply chain really is kind of in the later part of 2022, but that's because the revenue contribution is delayed by how we're putting this together. it's components from suppliers that we're kind of bringing together in unique ways. and so when we have some supply chain constraints, that's what's happening. that's how we're doing that work. so hopefully, that gives you a little bit more clarity because we're doing things that are on a platform level. and so that's what you need to kind of make it happen.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and then you guys talked about the normal recompete year next year. are there any kind of individually large ones that we should be monitoring?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, we don't have anything that's over five percent of our revenue.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian kinstlinger from alliance global partners. your line is now open.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
yes. just a couple of small numbers of questions. realizing that most of your bookings were from existing work. can you just give us that number for the september quarter of what was new and expansion of business as a percentage of the total?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
yes, i can do that, right? the quarterly bookings for this quarter, it was about 10% new, 90% recompete.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
great. and the other question is, you gave a lot of numbers that probably you could back into it. but for the third quarter, the nonrecurring benefits, i see a $2.5 million reversal for bad debts. i assume that helped, but also maybe what were the total nonrecurring benefits that include the contract closeouts in the quarter?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i mean, i think that clearly was a big part of it. and then still -- so that's probably about half of it plus the indirect expense carrying forward.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
so margins would have probably been more like the second quarter, if not for those benefits? is that how i should think about it?
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i mean, again, we were kind of looking at it for the full year, kind of normalizing the revised guide of 10.2% down to the normalized 9.4%.
brian kinstlinger -- alliance global partners -- analyst
okay. alright. thank you.
operator

operator
gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to the mantech third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to stephen vather, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
stephen vather -- vice president of m&a and investor relations and executive director of corporate development
welcome, everyone. thanks for participating on mantech's third quarter call. joining me today is kevin phillips, our chairman, ceo and president; judy bjornaas, our cfo; and matt tait, our coo. during this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts, and thus, their forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results. for a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our latest form 10-k and our other sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. on today's call, we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. these non-gaap measures should not be evaluated in isolation or as a substitute for gaap performance measures. you can find a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures discussed on this call in our third quarter earnings release. with that, let me hand the call over to kevin.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, stephen, and good afternoon, everyone. mantech delivered exceptional profitability and cash flow in the third quarter. however, revenue growth in bookings fell short of expectations. we are navigating our complex and uneven industry operating environment, which is creating certain challenges for us. that said, the foundational drivers for our long-term growth remains favorable, and we are positioned in higher priority areas of the market. operationally, we continue to feel the lingering impacts from the pandemic, namely on three fronts. the slower return to normal within our intelligence community customers, continuing supply chain challenges and a tight labor market. unfortunately, our expectations outpaced the recovery trajectories for both our intelligence business and the supply chain.
we remain confident in the attractive fundamentals of serving hard to penetrate intelligence community customers and our position in that market. we see durable demand across our solutions in full spectrum cyber, secure mission and enterprise it, data analytics and other key mission-focused offerings. however, in the near term, the intelligence component of our business continues to face meaningful pipeline and award delays, and we expect that a return to normal may take several more quarters. mantech's higher relative exposure to intel customers amplifies that impact, which is evident in our overall performance. next, the supply chain. while customer demand is clear, the supply chain challenges become much less predictable, significantly impacting the timing and level of material procurements.
similarly, we expect this trend to linger, but are hopeful that a path to normal is on the near horizon. finally, we are seeing the effects of a tightening labor market and have uncertainty about what affects the executive order on requiring vaccinations among our workforce will have in the fourth quarter and entering 2022. we have made concerted efforts to comply with this mandate, but still have some work to close the remaining gap prior to the december deadline. turning to the u.s. departure from afghanistan. we are proud to have supported this overseas contingency operation over the last two decades and thank our employees for their dedication to that mission over the years. withdrawal from afghanistan in march is what we see as a clear shift in national defense strategy around overseas counterterrorism operations and related support to one that is focused on near peer threats. in the short term, this shift will create a low single-digit headwind in our overall revenue for the balance of the year and into 2022.
additionally, we anticipate and are beginning to see reductions in selective socom-focused field support operations within the army. mantech is a project of the cold war. over the course of greater than 50 years, we have well understood the need to adapt to evolving mission requirements. as the mission moves to near peer focus, the vast majority of our portfolio is well aligned, and we are pivoting the balance to this future mission. in aggregate, the factors discussed in my earlier remarks, coupled with natural program conclusions that occur every year will constrain a level of near-term organic growth compared to the last few years. we are recalibrating our expectations for 2021 and 2022 as a result of our year-to-date performance, these headwinds and uncertainties. judy will review our revised outlook later on the call. moving to a quick budget update. we began the government fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which currently lasts through early december.
the congressional agenda remains focused on infrastructure, the debt ceiling and other priorities that may cause appropriations to continue to shift to the right. irrespective of the status of appropriations, our customers continue to have clearly defined priorities that align well with mantech's core capabilities and investment road map. first, the growth of both cyber and space warfighting domains partly driven by near-peer focus; second, the need to modernize it, software and systems to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. the needs within this trend are broad and complex, but notably, we are seeing greater customer need for automation, analytics and delivering data at the edge. lastly, the full and rapid implementation of digital warfare and traditional -- into traditional operating technology missions is of increasing importance. recently, we announced our intent to acquire griffin technologies for $350 million.
the acquisition builds on our position with an important department of defense customers and adds enhanced digital and systems engineering capabilities. demand for these capabilities has been robust, and we see this as a continued growth avenue organically as the near peer focus ramps into higher gear. we look forward to welcoming griffin's nearly 1,500 employees to the mantech family. we intend to maintain an active posture for value-accretive m&a, and our balance sheet is certainly supportive of additional acquisitions. judy will discuss how you should think about the pro forma business going into 2022. now i'll turn it over to matt to cover the business development and operational highlights for the quarter. matt?
matt tait -- chief operating officer
thank you, kevin. in the quarter, we booked $716 million in contract awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1.1 times. our last 12-month book-to-bill ratio also sits at 1.1 times, with a majority of the bookings for existing work. bookings in the quarter were propelled by the retention of important recompetes as well as incremental on-contract growth. the major awards in the quarter include winning a $476 million contract to continue providing space force with launch enterprise systems engineering and integration as well as a $51 million contract to continue providing the navy acoustic engineering services to support the naval, submarine and surface signature-silencing programs. these contract awards continue to demonstrate our capability strength in intelligence systems engineering. furthermore, we are pleased with the outcome of a multiyear strategic pivot into resilient o&m and rdt&e priorities within the navy, air force and other parts of the dod.
that said, q3 bookings were seasonally light and came in below our expectations. there were two principal drivers for that trend. first, as kevin discussed earlier, we lacked meaningful adjudications within our intelligence community customers. to add a bit more color, over the last 18 months, intel bookings have comprised less than 1/4 of mantech's overall bookings versus prior to the pandemic, it was averaging close to half of the company's total bookings. second, we were less successful than desired on new, large business pursuits in our federal civilian business. this is a part of our concerted effort to penetrate into new markets that will have persistent demand. we will continue to position ourselves to support existing intel, defense and homeland security customers while we make strategic moves to advance our expansion into other federal agencies. as a result of these bookings, our total backlog was $10.1 billion at quarter end, representing three percent year-over-year growth with funded backlog at $1.3 billion.
we exited the quarter with nearly $8 billion in proposals outstanding, which has a healthy mix of new business and recompete opportunities. we are continuing to prosecute our pipeline and are seeing steady proposal submissions. the volume, timing and competitive positioning on adjudications remain a key driver to the cadence of our quarterly bookings. we are continually fine-tuning our business development process to maximize optimal outcomes with respect to pipeline conversion. before i turn the call over to judy, i would like to take a minute to welcome the newest member of our leadership team. we are excited to have david hathaway join us as the head of our defense business. david has significant experience leading high-performance teams, focused on bringing technology solutions to an array of defense missions. i look forward to leveraging his valuable expertise to further affect our strategic, operational and technology initiatives across our dod customer base. with that, i'd like to turn it over to judy to discuss our financial results in more detail.
judith l. bjornaas -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, matt. quarterly revenue was $638 million, which was flat compared to q3 of 2020. q3 revenue fell short of expectations, most notably due to the delays in odcs that kevin referenced earlier. additionally, an uptick in pto usage and increased turnover pressured direct labor contribution in the quarter. we also saw some programs come to their natural end in q3. q3 ebitda was $73 million, up 27% from q3 of 2020. this resulted in an ebitda margin of 11.4%, up 240 basis points year-over-year as margins continue to benefit from stronger overall labor mix, continued indirect cost under spending and a onetime benefit related to a contract closeout for some international work. net income for the quarter was $38 million and diluted eps was $0.93, up 28% and 27% from q3, respectively. adjusted net income was $41 million and adjusted diluted eps was $1.01, up 23% and 22% from last year, respectively. our effective tax rate was higher than expected at 27.9% in the quarter.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. cash flow from operations was a robust $139 million in the quarter, which represented 3.6 times net income and was driven by a strong dso of 55 days. at quarter end, the balance sheet showed $145 million in cash and no debt. additionally, we distributed $15 million in dividends in q3, maintaining a steady return of cash to shareholders. the board has authorized us to continue our current cash dividend of $0.38 per share to be paid in december. the acquisition of griffin technologies reflects our commitment to capital deployment for long-term value creation through m&a. as mentioned by kevin earlier, we intend to remain active on m&a and are continuing to review opportunities that we view are additive to our competitive position. following the acquisition of griffin, we expect to have approximately 1.0 times leverage. moving on to guidance. we are decreasing our previously communicated guidance for revenue and increasing our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps to reflect year-to-date performance and likely outcomes for the remaining quarters, based on current market factors.
the drivers behind the revised guidance are continued impacts from delayed odcs, pressures from a more competitive labor market and reduced new business contribution. our revenue guidance is now $2.55 billion to $2.575 billion, representing a 1% to 2% growth year-over-year. we are increasing our outlook for adjusted net income to be in the range of $150.2 million to $152.2 million with adjusted diluted eps of $3.66 to $3.71. we are also increasing our expected ebitda margin for the year to be 10.2%, which represents a 110 basis point improvement over 2020. many of the same tailwinds for the q3 outperformance are responsible for the full year increase, which includes the lighter level of lower-margin odcs, strong indirect cost management and some onetime contract closeout fee pickups. year-to-date, margins continue to average higher than our full year guide, but there are known trends that will drive fourth quarter spend higher, primarily m&a-related expenses and greater pto utilization.
in total, when adjusting for these factors, our normalized 2021 ebitda margin would be approximately 9.4%, a nice uptick of 30 basis points from 2020. the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps ranges assume a slightly higher effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a consistent, fully diluted share count of approximately 41 million shares. finally, cash flow from operations is still expected to be at least $200 million, with capital expenditures expected to be a touch lighter than previously thought at less than 2.5% of revenue for the year. during this call, we have gone through a number of factors that will impact our expected financial performance for 2022. while it is premature to provide detailed 2022 guidance, we wanted to offer some directional commentary. we expect total revenue growth of at least 5%, which is inclusive of the full year contribution from griffin.
we are considering a number of factors in our assessment of 2022, many of which are a continuation of the issues we are dealing with in the second half of 2021. given the change in our expected near-term growth trajectory, i wanted to cross walk each of the major factors impacting our current view. as matt mentioned earlier, the headwinds to growth include the fact that year-to-date bookings have been disproportionately related to existing programs versus new work; the full year impact of natural program conclusions, inclusive of but not limited to afghan and certain field sustainment-related efforts; and a lingering uncertainty on the level and timing of intel new business efforts and the supply chain with respect to odcs. furthermore, it is our expectation that we will have another normal year of recompetes approaching 25% of revenue. moving on to margins.
our ebitda margin expectations for next year are in the 9.4% to 9.5% range, which implies flat to potentially up 10 basis points against our normalized 2021 ebitda margin. the business risks that we are closely monitoring, but are not fully factored into our guide, are the impact of the vaccination executive order and disruptions to the business from a potential extended lapse in government funding. our 2022 preview is confined to the current visibility into the business and market factors. we expect to refine this preliminary guidance on our year-end earnings call in february. let me hand the call back over to kevin for some closing remarks.
kevin m. phillips -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, judy. in closing, our team is keenly focused on pipeline conversion, attracting and retaining talent, leveraging our recent acquisitions to drive growth and continuing to deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value. as discussed in great detail, we experienced a market shift in some areas of our work, but we are seeing greater demand toward more cyber and technology-enabled mission needs. our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and customer sets are well aligned to national priorities. we're now ready to take your questions.
