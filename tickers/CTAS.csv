good day, everyone, and welcome to the cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. please go ahead.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning and thank you for joining us. with me today is scott farmer, cintas' chairman of the board and chief executive officer; and todd schneider, executive vice president and chief operating officer. we will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2020. after our commentary, we will be happy to answer your questions.
the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to scott farmer.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you mike and good morning everyone. as you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.
on may 13, we provided an update on how cintas' business has been affected by the covid-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. covid-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. our priorities are unchanged. they include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. i believe we're succeeding at both. our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers providing essential products and services to healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants, and many others. we provided healthcare customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mobs. we provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer sprays services. and we provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields, and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.
our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. the demand for items like hand sanitizers and n95 respirators has increased 10-fold in this pandemic. our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. in addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. we continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. we continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled work and are considered on-hold and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.
before turning the call back to mike, i want to conclude by stating that i'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. i'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. in addition, i am as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of cintas for our shareholders and working partners. our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance arguably as never resonated more than it does today. this pandemic will not soon be forgotten and its impact on society is likely transformative.
we believe the new trend of greater focus on health, readiness, and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. more healthcare scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed so fewer are worn in public. businesses including, universities and retail establishments are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. most businesses are providing larger budgets to align their -- to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the us to reduce dependence on other nations. we believe cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.
now, i'll turn the call back over to mike.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, scott. our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. earnings per diluted share or eps from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. free cash flow for this years fourth quarter was the highest it has been all year at $316 million. organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 9.6%. organic revenue for first aid and safety services operating segment increased 21.9%.
gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million, decreased 14.1%. gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million, decreased 34%. operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.
our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. one less workday in a quarter, has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. fourth quarter of fiscal '20, operating income was affected by many items caused by covid-19 including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. all of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. the additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our uniform direct sale business where customers in some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exists.
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.
at the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. this was for defensive purposes. we have a great cash flow business and as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver, but also to pay off of a $200 million term loan. we ended the quarter carrying a variable debt. our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to ebitda. our balance sheet is strong. we have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.
free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. we remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. we purchased $393 million of cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early march before the covid-19 pandemic. the amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.
looking ahead to fiscal '21. please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. one more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. one more workday also benefits operating margin and eps. fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20, due to one more day of revenue. by quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20. the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday, the second quarter will contain the same number of workdays, the third quarter will contain one less workday and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.
before turning the call over to todd schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses. i want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting covid-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. therefore we are not providing annual guidance at this time. however, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations. and they are as follows, revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion. uniform rental and facility services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%. first aid and safety services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%, earnings per diluted share of $2.00 to $2.20 and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.
as scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty. we are confident in our ability to manage the short term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. todd?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you, mike. the recent operating environment has certainly been challenging. as scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. at the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize, and execute. daunting challenges were overcome and many were viewed as opportunities facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency, and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. the results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in net promoter scores from our customers.
our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. however, many of our customers were closed, and even for those who are open, the impact on their financials of their business was substantial. for those customers who were open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.
i'll now turn to the fourth quarter of financial performance of our businesses. uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%. our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 46% in last year's fourth quarter. we had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter.
lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue, compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, face [phonetic] masks, towels and other items rented to customers. amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. this non-cash expense is the significant headwind in the short term, but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized. as mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the covid-19 coronavirus. excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, uniform rental and facility services operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a detrimental margin of 37%.
our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. this segments revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. revenue from servicing of first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying in place orders. however, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged. overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. sales, service, supply chain, finance, and others worked quickly to provide current customers with mask, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. in addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. the result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in may. businesses are echoing our mantra of, there is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.
the first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last years fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the covid-19 coronavirus, the first aid and safety services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. fire protection services include the performance of testing, inspection, and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers, and emergency lights. uniform direct sale business includes the provision of custom tailored apparel. all other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. organic revenue declined 24.5%. the fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay at home orders. uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 39.5%. revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality, and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. these industries have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
that concludes our prepared remarks. we are happy to answer your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we will take our first question today and that is from andrew steinerman with jp morgan securities. please go ahead with your question.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
hi. i was hoping you can give a comment about just small and medium-sized businesses in total. obviously, it's an important part of your client base, do you feel like the small businesses that haven't opened yet still are in a position to open and if not, do you feel like when would -- when would we know more?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well andrew, this is scott. i'd say we have ongoing conversations with our customers that are on hold and i would say that the majority of them intend to reopen. a lot of it depends on how long this lasts and that sort of thing, but we feel pretty good about it so far and the indications that we get from them are that they do intend to reopen. so -- but it's going to be -- it's so cloudy right now looking out into the future, i don't know that any of them can -- could on a state by state basis maybe they could give us some sort of an indication of their timing. but in total, it's very difficult for us to be able to do that for you.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
okay. and so far they felt like the federal support for small businesses during this juncture has been sufficient?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
there is -- i'm sure there are lots of opinions on that, but yeah, i think so. i think that we will find out, you know if more support is coming based on what we understand is going on in washington right now, both for businesses as well as for individuals and i think that supporting the individual wouldn't [phonetic] effect also be supporting the businesses because they'd have the money to spend to do so. but we'll find out more here in the coming weeks as that -- that gets resolved in dc.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
thank you, scott. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and we'll move on to our next question or comment and that is from seth weber with rbc capital markets. please go ahead with your question.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody. hope you're doing well. scott, in your prepared remarks, i heard several times you talk about the healthcare vertical and the opportunity there. can you just talk about whether you are actually seeing real time conversions here from hospitals that are switching to more outsourced scrub rental, just sort of the conversations that you're having there in that vertical in particular? and i know you've sort of targeted a more specific sales effort there, just traction on how that's going? thanks.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, we have for the last few years had healthcare as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. i think that you've all probably seen news reports of healthcare workers after work going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that there clothing was contaminated and hospitals realized that, healthcare workers realized that. traditionally, particularly in the nursing and of healthcare, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taken them home and washed them themselves. there has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrub so that healthcare workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. and that would be something that we could handle for them. we have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital, expand that into other areas of the hospital. and i think that is the beginning of a movement. we will see more and more of as i look to the future.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
seth, this is todd. just to expand upon that. as scott mentioned, you see the videos the folks in grocery stores where people are upset because what is on their garments. and what we're seeing is employers are worried about what people come in contact with from the point they leave their home to the point they arrive at the hospital. and employees are worried about what they're taking home as well, who they might come in contact with on the way homes and with those into their home laundry. so is professional cleaning -- hygienically cleaned laundry is really important and we've had a number of customers many of which are names you would recognize that are very interested in broadening those programs to help their employees and their businesses.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i would just add one more thing. that is not just the big hospital chains, it's also doctors' offices, dentists, healthcare workers in general and so we'll -- it's early, early stage, but we like the momentum that we're seeing there. and think that it has an opportunity as we look out in the future for -- for an area of really good growth.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's super helpful. thank you. and mike, if i could just get a follow up. and just the delta for the quarter came in a little bit better than i think your kind of mid-quarter -- late quarter update, is there anything that you would call out that drove just the relatively better end of the quarter, one-time -- big one-time sales or anything or is it just sort of trends just got a little bit better than you expected toward the end of may?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah seth, todd talked a little bit about it in his remarks that first aid really finished with a strong may of 40% growth and as much as anything it was that kind of performance that led us beyond the guidance that we gave in mid may.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. super helpful. thank you very much guys.
operator
thank you. and we'll move on to our next question and that is from george tong with goldman sachs. please go ahead with your question.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning. can you provide an update on your uniform rentals capacity plans, especially with the evolving pace of business reopenings and what your capacity plans might have in terms of an impact on detrimental margins over the next several quarters?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure george. the question is what is our capacity plan? is that -- just make sure i'm answering it the right way.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. recently you've indicated that you intend to maintain the majority of your capacity in anticipation of businesses reopening. and now with the pace of business reopenings obviously influx with covid inflections -- infections spiking in certain places, what's your -- what are your latest thoughts on maintaining that capacity? or will you plan to trim capacity given what we're seeing?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well let me -- let me sort of give this a broader view of how we -- how we've managed this up to this point. todd mentioned in his remarks that early on we had daily meetings with our leadership team. and that's hr, and it, and my direct reports, the presidents of divisions, global supply chain and we covered a number of different things in that -- in those meetings. it started with the safety of our people and how do we get them the right personal protective gear and how do we make sure that people who are arriving at work aren't infected and how do we take temperature, where do we get thermos, all that sort of thing. and then from there moving into the customers. but part of it also included a review of business and capacity. and generally speaking, we are happy with where we are from a capacity standpoint, although we continue to review it. there is a -- there is that we announced that we're shutting down an operation in minnesota and that was one that we had been looking at for some time. it was an acquired operation, it was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. and in that market we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern and so we announced that we're going to do that. we consistently review the operations in our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. todd, you got anything you want to add?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. george, great question. we're looking at this in the long term. we're excited about the where our position -- our business is positioned. we think that the demands for our products and services moving forward are going to be healthy. when we look at it, we think of image, safety, cleanliness are all things that businesses are very, very interested in. so we constantly are evaluating our capacity model. as you know capacity is really a local subject, it rolls up to a corporate subject. but we look at it locally and we're constantly evaluating it. but we're thinking long-term and we like our position and we like where the demand we believe going to be coming for our products and services.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and then as a follow-up, can you provide some additional detail on how revenue trends evolved moving through the quarter? and if you're fiscal 1q outlook assumes stable july run rates in august or if it assumes an improvement off of july levels?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
so george, we've seen -- obviously since the may call, we've seen some nice improvement in the revenue run rates in which we were in the may timeframe down in the mid to high teens. we've seen that reduce to the mid to high-single digits and we're expecting still a slight improvement, but [indecipherable] a lot of improvement as we move forward. so we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but not much. from this point.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful, thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll move on to our next question and that is from hamzah mazari with jefferies. please go ahead with your question.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. thank you. my question is on how do you -- the sustainability of first aid organic growth and also hygiene if you could touch on what you saw there in terms of growth? and whether you think that's sustainable for the balance of the year? obviously, demand is still there, but do you think the markets well supplied whereby that organic run rate drops off. just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about those two specific areas.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
great. thank you for the questions, this is todd. as mike and scott mentioned trying to forecast out past q1 is very challenging and the reason being is the spike in cases recently have -- have changed seems like. so it seems like every couple of two weeks, three weeks is more like two months, three months in the past. so -- but we do see as cases rise there is demand for ppe is so strong. as people -- as we believe that drops off with hopefully remedies -- vaccine eventually people will be back to work and then they'll be consuming more product out of our first aid cabinets. so -- so it's tough to forecast out past q1. but nevertheless, we think we're in a really good spot.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
hamzah, this is scott. i would add that i think, as a general statement the one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in may is because there was a really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizers, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean and if they could find somebody who had it they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. so it was almost to me like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. we get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their cloths and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that. i think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it and it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.
now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that that's a long-term change in the marketplace. i said in the may call that i think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. we have customers right now that have come to us and said look, i have 7,000 branches, i need hand sanitizer stations in all of them and i need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full, that is for my employees and my customers. we've seen large universities big 10, pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses. they want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available, but the service to come by in a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them. so i think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. and once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizer, sprays services and things like that, they start talking about the restroom services and if they have people that need uniform, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. so from a hygiene standpoint, i'm confident that this -- this trend is going to continue.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
one last item on that subject is we -- what scott mentioned there is such a need for these products because they need to restore -- these folks, whether it's a bank branch or a hotel, whether it is a university, they need to restore confidence in their employees, their customers, their students, their guests, whatever it is and these products are critical to restoring confidence. and then what it is also doing for us is it is allowing because it is such an important subject to these folks, it's allowing for us to get an audience at very high levels within organizations, higher than in many cases ever been before in organizations and then we're able to speak to the comprehensiveness of what we can provide and it resonates.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful color. just a follow-up question, i'll turn it over. just on the sap system, could you maybe talk about what kind of data that gives you now relative to what you didn't have before? i realize it's covid-19 and demand environment is different, so you may see benefits of cross selling come in later from the sap. but just for investors just to get a sense of what do you have today that gives you sort of a full view of the customer that you didn't have before that could maybe help you longer term once you come out of covid or during covid even?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hamzah, thanks again for the question. this is todd. sap is doing a lot of things for us. we are -- we now have one view of our customer not completely, right because we have it in our first aid business and our rental business, but a significant portion of our business, it's helping the speed at which we were able to retrieve data, which is helping us to make decisions in more real-time basis than in the past. and it's also helping with some other items that we're doing from a technology standpoint, give the customer a view of their spend with us, help them be able to manage their business with us and obviously there is some, some other benefits that we're seeing from a ability to reuse products, get a good view of our stock rooms, of our supply chain, etc. so it's been very beneficial.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and we'll move on to our next question and that is from manav patnaik with barclays. please go ahead with your question.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. good morning, gentlemen. my first question is just around the supply chain that you guys have. you talked earlier in the call about your scale aligned to gather additional relationship event there is and so forth. and then just broadly, like has there been any other disruptions and would you say net-net, it's been pretty smooth?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
manav, this is scott. i would say that in this -- first of all, i think this goes back to the morning meetings that we were having. we were getting real time feedback on what was going on in the field, what our customers were looking for, what they needed and that sort of thing and we got to jump on it early, by having the entire group together to say we need to get out and source face masks, hand sanitizers, all of the hygiene products because there is a huge demand coming. and our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that. and i said on the last call that i think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. we are in good and getting better stock position on most of these items and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it all. so i think that our supply chain has done a great job. so i would say disruption, no, i don't think there has been any disruption. there were some a little bit at the beginning when we -- when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done -- they've done a great job in meeting the demand.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
got it, thank you. and just a broader question around managing the cost base. i know there's obviously a lot of uncertainty. you talked about the minnesota facility that you were looking to buyback. i think there was another one in the milwaukee area. so just -- just wondering how you're thinking about what further cost actions you need to take now? or is it just a wait and see only if things get worse, do you cut more or rationalize more?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
manav, this is todd. so from a cost standpoint, we know we believe we've been through the worst of it. we believe we've shown a great ability to manage through that process and we are continuing to adjust our cost structure and all facets as we move through this pandemic. we believe it's short term, we believe the long-term of our businesses looks a very, very positive. but we've successfully managed through what we believe is the worst of it and we're going to manage through this process as we move forward. no matter what gets thrown at us.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. and we will move onto our next question and that is from andrew wittmann with r.w. baird. please go ahead with your question.
andrew wittmann -- r.w. baird -- analyst
okay, thanks for taking my question. i guess i wanted to check in a little bit on the competitive environment. every recession is different, but historically if volumes wane in times or can be increased price competition. so i was just wondering, scott or todd, if you could comment on what you're seeing from the competition? if it's too soon to say or if there have been any changes in the marketplace, what those changes are, if any, and how you're reacting to them?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, this is scott. i'll make some comments and then todd has anything he wants to add, i'll turn it over to him. but overall, i think that it's difficult to say so far what's happening from a pricing standpoint as a result of covid-19. we will get anecdotal evidence on a market by market basis that things are competitive, somebody is doing some crazy things, but we always seem to get that. i would tell you that one of the things that we have seen and seen evidence of is that we do have some competitors out there who are struggling to service their customers. i don't know whether that is supply chain issues that they can't get the product, whether it is that they have service issues, were something happened in their service force or what it is, but we have seen some signs of that. i wouldn't call that a major trend, but i think it is one of the things that is unique about this pandemic is that for one reason or another, some of these businesses are just having a hard time operating as they ordinarily would. todd, any other feedback?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think the other item is scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and i completely agree with that, but one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that scott -- that we referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers, we are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a one-time sale. it's going to be a long-term customer. and so that's how we approached it. generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is i would say andrew, i haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we garnered an opportunity to that we deliver.
andrew wittmann -- r.w. baird -- analyst
that makes sense. i guess the corollary to that question is, is the stress that's out there in the marketplace, do you think potentially going to shake loose opportunities for acquisitions in this environment as well?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's tough to say where and when somebody might decide to sell their business. but you can see a scenario around this in just about any industry where it could cause people to make decisions to sell their business. we obviously are in a position where we could -- we could afford to make acquisitions and that would be something that we would be looking forward to do if the opportunities present themselves.
andrew wittmann -- r.w. baird -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and we'll move on to our next question or comment and that is from gary bisbee with bank of america merrill lynch, please go ahead with your question.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi guys, good morning. so i wanted to ask a question about the costs. the first quarter outlook implies sequentially improved revenue, but sequentially lower costs, so can you just give us a sense sort of how much costs you've taken out or how we should think about how that will annualize through the p&l when you'll actually see all of that? and the last piece of that, should we think that some of the cost take-out, you've done is structural or is it more really temporary that we should think most of it comes back at some point in the future when revenue begins to trend -- trend back to the historical level? thank you.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, it's a little bit of -- a little bit of all of the above there. we have eliminated all discretionary spending, business travel is down, matter of fact we're not allowing people to travel right now. so those kind of costs are down. some training meetings where people ordinarily would be flying and traveling to go to training and staying in hotels isn't happening, those are happening on zoom meetings and team meetings and things like that. we have made some changes to right size the organization from a labor standpoint. those can and will go up as volume comes back and that sort of thing we have -- we've eliminated, we announced that we're going to close one of our operations, that's more of a permanent or just a longer-term type of thing, but we do all of the above and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can ahead in either direction. we can manage the cost as we grow into it. or if it -- you know, i think in may, there were 44 states that had stay in place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. if it goes back to that, well we know that world looks like to, we've been there. we're off mid to high teens in revenue and we know what we need to do to right size to go back to that point. i don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the p&l statement and make a good margin.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i know you're not giving guidance beyond this quarter, but what would a reasonable way to think about that moving forward, be that you think you can manage the cost structure relatively in line with change in revenue. so in other words, if the q1 margin actually looks quite strong year-over-year given the revenue headwinds that you could keep that kind of pacing or there is some step function cost that could come back in at some point when you do see revenue much stronger?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah gary, you know what we saw in the fourth quarter was such a precipitous drop in revenue that it's -- it's hard to react, but we did and you're seeing some of those benefits of the reaction in the first quarter. now as we move, scott talked a little bit about the -- we will adapt to the revenue and the environment as we move forward, but there are going to be some things like discretionary spending and travel that certainly will come back, we still have a hiring freeze on today and as we get more clarity on the future, we will start to then think quite a bit more about adding to the capacity for growth like we normally would in a kind of a normal environment. i mean we will get back to that kind of thing, but certainly we're seeing some benefits in the first quarter of the moves and the decisions we made and we're going to adapt as we move forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, but it's a little bit unclear still what that environment looks like. and so we'll make -- we'll continue to make decisions rapidly so that we can do our best to adjust to the levels of revenue and levels of capacity that are necessary.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. if i could sneak one more in. historically in q4, you've given the rentals mix by products, is that something you have at your fingertips and be willing to share this year?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. we -- our uniform rental business was 50% of the rental segment, dust was 18%, hygiene was 14%, shop towels 4%, linen products 10%, catalog 4%.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
not a lot of change from the -- from the last year in any of those categories.
operator
thank you. and we'll move onto our next question and that is from tim mulrooney with william blair. please go ahead with your question.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, everybody. scott, you mentioned. good morning. scott, you mentioned at the beginning of this call about -- about being there for your customers when they reopen, what percentage of your customer base would you say has reopened at this point? and also can you help us understand what those conversations look like, when the customer reopens is it a slower ramp, is there any sort of contract renegotiation, or do you just kind of -- do you just pick up where you left off? thank you.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, first of all we're dealing with a business owner or manager who did not make the decision themselves necessarily to shut their business down. and so the conversation is around what are your plans when do you hope to reopen, help us understand, you know what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you, have you furloughed or let go any of your people. we have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business, we can share some of that with you. prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. we have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide, would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things. but really it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. we look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us and we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing, we're here today to help you get reopened as your business starts to come back, we can get in all the rest of the details of that sort of thing and i would tell you, tim that we use the net promoter score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services and we have seen a dramatic increase in net promoter scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have, i would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and ceos of pretty big companies, because of what we've done to help them. but it has improved our relationship with as a general statement across the board with our customers as we help them through this and i'm proud of the way that our front line people have been handling this. and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
tim, this is todd. we have such a diverse customer base, both by industry and geographically. so the conversation with the customer really depends upon what's going on in their business, where they are geographically. some of them they're opening back up and they had no revenue before they open back up, some had virtually all their revenue. and in that conversation, as you can imagine varies dramatically depending upon what they were experiencing in the business. but generally speaking, most are being were impacted even those who remained open. and we work with them, we work with the customers and we said -- they said, hey, we can only afford so much. we said, well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment and that helped them and it helped us to -- it is helping us to bring more value to our customers.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
that's all great color. thank you, todd. thank you, scott. a strong increase in net promoter scores is an encouraging sign. thank you and good luck next quarter.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks tim.
operator
thank you. and we'll move on to our next question. and that is from toni kaplan with morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. in the past you've talked about how, about 60% of your growth comes from converting no programmers. i'm just curious in this environment, are you seeing a change in that mix? are you seeing higher growth from existing customers? are you seeing maybe new customer signing up for the hygiene products? just trying to think about how that growth dynamic has been changing in this covid period?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
toni, this is scott. it's -- we're a couple of few months into this. so it might be difficult for us to give you any hard data on that, but clearly, you know for certain products, both existing customers who haven't used it from us in the past and prospects need it and so we are, we're working very hard on both sides of that to provide that to businesses. i think that there are businesses that may not have typically been users of our services but are looking to us now and saying there is an opportunity -- there is a company out there that can provide this stuff to us and provide it on a regular basis, where we don't have to worry about it anymore. we should call them and talk to them. so i think there is some opportunity in the no programmer market for us to broaden our opportunity it to continue to grow.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and todd, maybe talk a little bit of sales rep productivity that we're seeing right now.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, thank you, mike. toni, what -- our sales rep productivity. i am so impressed by their creativity and by their tenacity, they are -- productivity is doing really, really well and it's in part because of our culture, because of our partners, and because we have products and services that people want and need to again help restore confidence in their employees and their customers, clients, etc. so as you can imagine our sales partners aren't exactly out physically in front of folks nearly as much as they were, but they're busy. they are busy at all-time levels and doing it via calls, teams calls, zoom, phone calls, you name it and we're very encouraged by that.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. and i was hoping you could give an update on the final amount that you've spent on sap this year? and what you expect to spend next year? and just an update on any benefits that you're seeing so far from the implementation?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the spend this year toni, has generally been in that recurring -- the implementation costs and the training and consulting costs. and we've talked over the last few years about $12 million annually of that for the last several years. and that amount will drop off as we've completed that rental roll out. from the perspective of the benefits, todd talked a little bit about the information that's available and sometimes that's hard to quantify, especially in the short term. we're seeing the sales rep productivity be good. we're seeing some, some good information on the one view of the customer, the online portal information and so those are going to drive some benefits, but it's going to take a little bit of time to see that and it's pretty difficult at this point to quantify what that might be.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. and the $12 million goes to zero next year?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean it does drop off. in -- toni, in the midst of this changing environment, dealing with the pandemic, it's going to be a little bit hard to say that's going to be x-basis points for the year, but that $12 million does drop off as that implementation has been completed.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question and that is from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel nicolaus. please go ahead with your question.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. hey, mike is there any way you can help investors quantify the opportunity for the scrubs rentals in cintas? like what's the opportunity just in general into healthcare with that? and how much of your sales are anyway into healthcare and is there like a way to think about the pull-through? in other words, we're hearing a lot of it. this is a great opportunity and conceptually we can understand that, we're trying to figure out like when you put pen to paper what could this mean for you guys?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, shlomo as scott talked about the healthcare opportunity a little bit earlier and we love the -- we love the opportunity. we loved it before the pandemic, but as we sit here today we like it even more. it's about 7% of our total revenue. and we think that's got a real opportunity to grow. you know it's hard to put pen to paper and give you a specific number especially when we are in the midst of this pandemic environment, but we love the opportunity and when we get things like scrub rental products in the hospitals we are there almost every day and that invites more and more opportunities, whether it's in microfiber or first aid or other types of cintas opportunities. we love being there with our customer and talking to them about the challenges that they face and so generally can lead to more enterprise type sales at those big hospitals. and as we move forward, scott talked a little bit about, we're seeing this cleanliness idea move to the smaller healthcare facilities as well and that creates opportunity in the scrubs, in the microfiber and other places. so we really do like the opportunity as we move forward, but it's pretty difficult to put a specific number on it right now.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
all right, thank you. i appreciate that. and then maybe just one for scott, i know you talked enthusiastically about the opportunity you got with your supply chain. and that it's a real differentiator and your ability to access very high levels of the organizations now, you had a very long successful career in this industry, how would you rank this opportunity now versus what you've seen in different points in time you career in terms of being able to have access and then potentially be able to capitalize on that in terms of driving your business forward in terms of additional sales because of that access at a higher level of the organization?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
shlomo, you're right, i've been around for a while, sometimes longer than i can believe have been at this -- i started in 1981, right out of college. so it's -- i've seen a lot happen in this business and in this industry. i have always looked at this business with the thought that we have great opportunities ahead of us. and so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others, but there are people that when i first started to go into the trade association meetings didn't think the entire industry -- the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. and so we've been able to grow through all of this. i look out into the future and i say i'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. i think we're in a very good position and we obviously all of us need to resolve this pandemic and i read some great news this morning that one of the reports i saw, i think it was in the wall street journal that pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in october for a rollout of a vaccine in january. and whether it's january or february or whatever it is, if you think about it, this is july, end of july and so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine and hopefully when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up and i think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
we take our next question. and that is from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer. please go ahead with your question.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning. i was just hoping to focus on the travel and hospitality end markets, airlines, crews, hotel, gaming, which look like they might have a bit of a tail of some trouble. just curious your conversations, i know you're not providing guidance beyond the current quarter, how should we think, based on conversations you've with those customers, the good and the bad of consideration looking out over the coming fiscal year? just anecdotally, what you think are some puts and takes we should keep in mind? thanks.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
scott, this is todd. certainly those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say have been they're facing some serious headwinds. but our conversations with them is that they are looking at it long-term. they are certainly worried about business travel coming back, leisure travel, they think will bounce back faster, but where -- we are working with them at very high levels and in the case of a few specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. and a really, all gets back to confidence. the guests have to feel confident that they can travel in the states and we are an important portion of that. now, certainly they're not, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like. and frankly, that they would like, but we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence and that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. so they see that much value and if that -- they're investing in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. and as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties etc. but we're all in hopes that as scott mentioned that we get to our remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly that way the ultimate confidence can be restored.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
that is all primarily direct sale business for us as well. so at least on the uniform side. so the vast majority of that is reflected in our direct sale results. and they obviously have been hit probably the hardest of all of the segments out there and you know maybe that means that it's going to take them longer to recover, but at some point looking out in the future, i think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. we're going to stay some place when we get there. and as todd says their ability to show us as customers of theirs, that we are safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they had to offer. but those industries are going to be around. they're not, they're not going to go away. this is may change it some ways, but there'll be -- they will be out there. they will recover.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great, thanks scott and todd. and then just as quick follow-up on different subject. scott, you touched on earlier on the cash availability in consideration of m&a in this environment, just one bigger picture thoughts on capital allocation for the company because you do have flexibility, are you going to sit for a while and watch and wait and see what happens and be conservative or might we see the -- becoming offensive with m&a, you've addressed, but also other uses of cash may be return of capital, any thought there? thanks.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yeah. i think that our priorities have been and i think looking forward will continue to be that we would like to make acquisitions. we would like to make investments that would help us continue to grow the business. mergers and acquisitions would be a great way for us to do that. we also have a long track record of increasing our dividend and those decisions will be made at a future point about what next years or what our next dividend would be. but that is an important priority for us and obviously, as you've seen in the past, even into the spring stock buybacks have played a role when opportunities present themselves. i would say that sort of attitude approach is likely to continue as we look out in the future when and how much and things like that depends on what opportunities present themselves. but our priorities really haven't changed. if we had an opportunity to make an acquisition now, we would -- we would certainly want to look at that and take advantage of that opportunity.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst

2021-Q1,CTAS,2020-09-23 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day everyone and welcome to the cintas' quarterly earnings results conference. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to paul adler, cintas' vice president, treasurer and investor relations. please go ahead.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer & investor relations
thanks april, and good morning and thank you for joining us. with me today is scott farmer, cintas' chairman of the board and chief executive officer; todd schneider, executive vice president and chief operating officer; and mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. we will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. after our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements, that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially, from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points, contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to scott farmer.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. this continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services. and they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough, for their truly impressive achievements.
before we get into the financial results, i'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. the hospital system in michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. these garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. the hospitals had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. the hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource to procurement and laundering to cintas, so they could concentrate on patient care.
another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. in california, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. in addition, our first aid business is providing them with a $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. through another university system in california, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks.
a restaurant chain, that has been a customer since 2007, had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. in talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted for service frequencies and inventories, in partnership with them. they were so pleased with the way that we treated them, that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants.
a casino customer in ohio recently reopened after being dormant, due to covid-19 restrictions. in order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items, to increase cleaning protocols, including dusk mats and microfiber mops and towels. and, a city government in texas was a no programmer, until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. they were so happy with the execution, that we gained their trust to provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well. they were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days.
these examples are just a handful of the many, and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, remains robust. scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term, reach long-term benefits. our net promoter scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher.
earning the trust of the customer enables further penetration and cross-selling, and our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers, and add new customers, by procuring and providing items in short supply. our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday, by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance, has never resonated more, than it does today. a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. we are well positioned for this new normal.
i'll turn the call over to mike now, for a commentary on the financial results. mike?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks scott and good morning. our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. earnings per diluted share or eps were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. organic revenue for the first aid and safety services' operating segment increased 17.1%.
gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million, decreased 2.7%. gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter, and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses, as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including, discretionary spending.
operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. our fiscal first quarter contained one more work day than the prior year first quarter. one more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin, due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense, being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. in addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. first quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt-to-ebitda. our balance sheet is strong. we have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion.
for financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. one more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. one more workday also benefits operating margin and eps. fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better, in comparison to fiscal '20, due to one more day of revenue. in fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. in fiscal '21, workdays by quarter, are 66 in q1, 65 in q2, 64 in q3 and 66 in q4. please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
before turning the call over to todd schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, i want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. due to the continuing covid-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. therefore we are not providing annual guidance at this time. however, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and eps to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. we expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%, and we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22%, compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter.
i'll now turn it over to todd.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you, mike. before i review the business results, i'd like to build off of scott's comments. while the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. the majority of our existing customers that reopened and our employee partners worked diligently in partnership with these businesses, to get them ready for the workday. despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business, before the covid-19 pandemic started, because of the virus' impact on health and the economy.
in keeping with the cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency, to offset these headwinds. significant opportunities for new revenues exist, because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students patients, etc, that they will remain healthy and safe. additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks, that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. the value we provide businesses, has never been more evident. in fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, covid-19 procurement taskforces, and hospitality, cleanliness councils.
there is greater demand for services and products we already provide, such as [technical issues] in other areas, demand is so attractive, that we are providing new services and products, made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, salesforce and cash flow. these include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand and dispenser service, and sanitizing spraying service.
with that, i'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our businesses. the uniform rental and facility services operating segment, includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. this segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%.
our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense, as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses.
our first aid and safety services operating segment, includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. this segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million, the organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. the first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% for the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter, were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. the uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. uniform direct sale however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
all other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. organic revenue declined 22.2%. the fire business organic revenue declined 5.3%, due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. the uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers, largely falls within this segment. these industries continue to be among the hardest hit, by the pandemic.
that concludes our prepared remarks. we are happy to answer your questions.

[operator instructions]. and we'll first hear from seth weber of rbc capital markets.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody. hope everybody's keeping well. i had a couple of questions on the first aid safety business. i guess maybe mike, can you just talk to how -- do you feel like you're still seeing large one-time sales in that category, or do you feel like that this is -- the growth rate there has been reset to a higher level, kind of on a sustainable basis? and then on a follow-up question, can you just talk -- give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply chain, on the cost side? i think todd called out some higher cogs for some ppe, is that, do you think just a temporary issue or will that -- is that sort of the new normal, just on the cost side? thank you.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
seth, this is scott. i'll take the first part of that. i'll let todd take the second part of that. on first aid and safety, i think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it, is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of ppe through the first aid business, are similar to what happens in the direct sale business, when we sell a big new customer. there is a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level, and so we are seeing that in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business, that are now moving into that maintenance level. does it mean that there aren't other customers out there, that we can find and identify? but i think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter, is pandemic hit, and so i would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode, on those type of things.
i would say that probably means that, we may not grow in the high teens in first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
seth. this is todd. completely agree with scott there is, you kind of end up in a large first order, and then there is some maintenance mode there. but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. they are in great demand for some of these products out there; gloves, mats, and hand sanitizer, etc, so we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them. but we are encouraged still that, we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets; it's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, but we are also anxious to see the cogs to moderate back to -- closer to where it was before.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and maybe, seeing a pickup in the cabinet business and stuff, i know that, that you talked about some strength and i think --
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
seth, you sound a bit muffled. can you start that question over please?
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sure sorry. i was just wondering, if you have seen a pickup in the cabinet business? i know last quarter, you talked about -- you know that you're having challenges getting into facilities and things like that. has the cabinet side of the business picked up as well?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, well, there's -- great question seth. there is -- our new cabinet sales are going quite well. but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. they are close. so that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. but long term, while we've pivoted helping our customers and long term, we are quite bullish on the direction of the organization.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
super. okay, thank you very much guys. i appreciate it.

[operator instructions]. next we'll hear from george tong of goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi thanks. good morning. you talked about healthy growth for scrubs and isolation gowns in the healthcare vertical, both among existing customers and in the no programmer market. at this point, what percentage of revenue is being generated by healthcare customers? and how quickly is this vertical growing?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
george, this is scott. when we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment, that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sale business, and obviously some uniform rental and fs business. it represents about 7% of our total revenue now. we are excited about what we see in that in that segment. healthcare represents about 70% of gdp, and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. the scrub rental business and these isolation gowns, and from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, i think you'd be [indecipherable] that these isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients, to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that. no need to get into a whole separate category on that.
but we're excited on what we see there. covid has brought a realization to healthcare providers, that taking -- of what wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home, may not be the right approach and they're looking for ways to outsource, managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. i would say that, healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. and so we remain very optimistic about this segment.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and as revenues begin to recover over the near to intermediate term, can you provide some perspectives on what you expect for incremental margin flow through, particularly as operating leverage begins to kick in, and you start to see utilization and capacity rates recover?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah i think george from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past -- we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. clearly we've exceeded that in this first quarter. longer term, that's still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow, and we are managing the number of salespeople that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need. and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue, as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you.

hamzah mazari of jefferies.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you. my first question is maybe for scott. i know you've touched on some examples of the net new business, sort of in your prepared remarks. but maybe if you could just talk about, how the sales cycle today compares to pre-covid, in converting some of these customers? i assume healthcare has accelerated given some of your comments, maybe even foodservice. but maybe if you could just talk about, how that cycle differs today, versus pre-covid? it seems like it has accelerated? i think you've touched on outsourcing potentially accelerating coming out of this period?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to provide a little color there and todd may want to chime in, as we go through this. but you know, the pre-covid we had decisionmakers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. i think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services, certainly shortened that sales cycle. decisions were made more quickly. it's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive risks, but in many cases it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services that they needed to fulfill a customer's order. i am proud to say that, we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory, and so we've been reasonably successful and being able to help these companies out. as we look at sales productivity among our sales force, where we have been through the entire covid period. the selling at very impressive productivity rates are very high historically, we like to see that happen, we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company, and so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market trying to make reasonably quick decisions, and we think we can do very well in that regard.
todd i don't know if you have anything to add?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, hamzah it's good question. it really varies dramatically based upon who you're calling on, the products you're selling. our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. and i've been really impressed by how they've been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like in the way. but we have products and services that people really need to -- i'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests in their customers, how we want to describe it students, their patients. when you have those available it does shorten the sales cycle because there is sometimes when we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go.
and so, again there are so many different sales process is going on at any one time. it's tough to say, make a suiting statement, but i think generally speaking yeah, it's setting up because of the urgency of making sure people were taking care of, and we are again blessed to be in a good spot with those products and services and that creates confidence in our people and our customers and showing in the productivity.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then just my follow-up question is just on the hygiene business. could you maybe talk about the outlook there, but particularly what is your value proposition in hygiene versus some larger competitors that may be moved into that market first? i know your product looks nicer than ecolab from the outside, but hand sanitizers and such, but well maybe just give us a sense of the value prop you have in that business, because it seems like a newer business for you, even pre-covid obviously it's accelerated today.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hamzah, i'll start then and scott can feel free to jump in. and we're -- and we appreciate your comment on our products. we were -- we invest a heck of a lot into our r&d to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, put a lot of investment in it and we have -- we've been in the hygiene business for, i'll call it decades, right. it's just that we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, september 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security, and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that is -- that has been something that's been positive for our business.
so our customers love the fact that we have availability. we've attracted products. we have a improved inventory distribution system, very fair approach to how we handle things and we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck, they can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs. we are able to, because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and it allows for us to be able to inspect, what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more box. so that's the route infrastructure and obviously distribution center to our system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, hamzah, i'd say it this way, just to echo what todd said, the -- what we do that most of our other competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. most of the time our customer who is finding it from a supply house or traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory, then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. they're out of supply for maybe a few days, and that sort of thing. and they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them.
and restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. and when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. so i think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
great. very clear. thank you so much.

manav patnaik of barclays.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, good morning gentlemen. my first question is, clearly there's a winning a lot of new mandates here. in the past, you talked about how non-programmers really continue to give the new sales. is that sales, does that focus shifting more now, because i guess the covid driven demand. and is it -- are you seeing competition at the same kind of -- list as well or there is an element that you guys just winning some of that new shares as well if that how it phases?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so manav, i think you're asking is -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from no programmers and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period, and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. and you know, i'll start. as todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. and we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago, but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to just hygiene, messaging, which is resonating so well.
and so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past, and when we get our foot in the door, good things can happen when they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. and so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter, but more so in this first quarter.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
and frankly that was part of the question of the sales cycle. the sales cycle is certainly a big set up just because we are selling more no programmers. there is no hurdle to get over to sell something. they can buy immediately. and that's been very positive for us. as mike mentioned, we're selling into different variety of different prospects, and we're also because of the urgency, and the intensity of what is important to these businesses, we're able to get it levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past, quicker.
so that again speed things up. when decision makers hear our value proposition, it resonates. and so there is -- we certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, and mainly for our customers. but there is some shine of light, it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have, the value that we provide and giving us an audience at high levels quickly.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
okay, that make sense. and in terms of at least examples you provided it sounds like there is relaxed situation that is coming to you guys for the offerings, but maybe just on the flip side, can you just talk about your, kind of small business customers, and how they just kind of survived more? do you anticipate risk further down the road if there is not a lockdown that they can even survive? just any color there would be appreciated.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. obviously that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. it's different in each line, because of various local government, so state governments that have put restrictions in place. i'd say generally speaking, the small customers that are open right now, are weathering this as a general statement pretty darn well. i think it says a lot about the american entrepreneurial spirit, to see them able to do the things that they're doing, with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. but some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet, because of various restrictions that have been put on them, for customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. so you know, clearly, i think for the american economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received, so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating into a -- sort of a new normal, but a normal that allows them to operate more traditional fashion.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst

andy wittmann with baird.
andrew wittmann -- rw baird -- analyst
great, thanks. i have a question and then a follow-up question. i mean clearly here in the quarter, you saw quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the organic trends, in talking about the rental segment, i guess, in particular. and i'm just curious if you could give a little bit more detail here, because when we look at the guidance for next quarter, and suggest that revenues will be down 5% or 6% year-over-year and that's not too dissimilar from what you saw here in the quarter. so how has the month-over-month trends progressed, in comparison to what the implied revenue outlook is, and just any color that you have in terms of your visibility in this, and how you chose to select this range, with all the uncertainty, is it conservative or other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
andy, this is todd. good question. certainly, this has been an unusual environment. there was 20 million jobs that were lost, seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the very early portion of the summer. and then, as you've seen then, the summer that we are on, things moderated a bit and jobs returned. and there are still 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. so that has certainly impacted our business. we need more businesses to come back. we are still guiding toward sequential growth from q1 to q2, we do a one less workday in q2 versus q1. and we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers, of what we're providing. but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. but we're very much looking forward to q2, q3 and q4, and we like the trend lines that we're seeing.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
maybe i'll offer a couple, one is, scott talked a little earlier about the first aid and safety large personal protective equipment sales, that kind of turning into maintenance a little bit. so keep that in mind. another point i'll make is, if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as q2, you're talking about $1.720 million. and so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it, does look to nice sequential improvement. and keep in mind, the last point i'll make is, last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well.
and so we have put it all together, echoing what todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment, and one that is -- that still contains a fair amount of -- i'll say, lack of clarity, let's say. and so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement.
andrew wittmann -- rw baird -- analyst
thanks mike for that, that's good perspective. i want to also kind of ask on the cost side here. anytime you've got basically ebitda up against declining revenue, that's a very surprising and very expensive, very good outcome for the company. we're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking, if there was anything one-time either positively or negatively. in other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that, that were recognized in the quarter that need to treated back in here, as the year progresses, or other things if you continue to do some level of restructuring, certainly, that was a big factor in the fourth quarter. it sounded like you had it most mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter. but mike, i was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over 100% here, on a go-forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, i'll start that. i wouldn't out any specific one-time items. but as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity and we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze, and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. and as the quarter went on, you know revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. and so, we started to bring -- we started to hire back revenue producing positions, and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. but in the first quarter -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected.
i'll point to a couple of things though, within the quarter. energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. we talked a little bit about discretionary spending. if you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. we are itching to get out to visit customers in our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly, but some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well.
and then the third thing i'll say is last year, you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. we kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. all in all, though, andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. and it also shows that as we move out of this, we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, etc.
andrew wittmann -- rw baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

andrew steinerman.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, it's andrew. i just wanted to get a little more clarification about monthly trends? i definitely understand we are in uncertain times, and there are still many jobs to return to the workplace yet. i just wasn't sure, if when you were talking about year-over-year organic revenue declines in rental, if you saw our september, meaning what we've already experienced, continue to narrow from august, so our clients narrowing in september year-over-year versus august, or have we already seen kind of september decline sort of hover with august. so it's really is the uncertainty in like october and november, or you've seen some hovering in september?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. and certainly todd talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. and so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer, and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. but our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that, our -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. and so september, while moderated from let's say june and early july is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan -- analyst

next we'll hear from gary bisbee of bank of america.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys. good morning. i guess i love to go back to the margins a bit more. so you obviously you've done a great job cutting costs and deferring some investment. and i heard your earlier answer the earlier question about sort of what helped it this quarter. but can you give us any sense of how to think about the cadence of costs coming back? do you envision the ability to manage that pretty tightly with sequential improvement in revenue or are there some costs at some point that could come back more quickly?
and i guess as part of that, have you identified anything within your cost reduction efforts to-date that you think could turn into a more permanent or sustainable cost reductions for the business?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
gary, this is scott. first of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs and we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization. so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online. that may be trucks that have been and therefore service reps that had been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen in through the first quarter.
some of that is coming back online as a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. we're bringing on some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. in the second quarter we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some tv advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. so these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs.
are there things that we look at and say we maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? we're always looking for those kind of things. and that is part of the culture that we have as a company, and when we find them we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. i think it's there, nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward.
we're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been, and i think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize what else can we do to get efficient. so i think we've done a really good job. and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. that said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that i think for the long-term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all of which are within the guidance.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hey gary, this is todd. as scott talked about growing is expenses, it's an investment. and i think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down meaning as the economy kind of went off the cliff. and we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully that continues. and i don't think it's a whole lot more fund to manage on way up, and it is a way down, and in our people feel that way. and when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, it is -- as scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens.
you evaluate the organization different, and one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers. do they want us there? should we be there in person as much? what is the team's call or zoom call or facetime or whatever it is, business moves fast and we are evaluating that, our customers are evaluating that. but it does allow things to speed up, and will that have a long-term impact? it will, we shall see. i think certainly in the short and intermediate future, that's what we see.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thanks. and then just a follow-up. you talked a lot about the sanitizer sales and a big opportunity there. is it right, is that all flows through the hygiene and facilities business within rentals? and if that is right, can you give us any sense sort of how well that's doing? and maybe what the underlying rental revenue trend is today, or how it's been trending, excluding that hygiene business? just trying to get a sense if that's doing a lot worse and hygiene is just absolutely, killing it today. any color on that would be great. thank you.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, great, gary. so the hygiene, excuse me, the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rental certainly our first aid customers as well. we saw sanitizer whether it's in various forms. so that is -- so you'll see it in both, but predominantly in the rental organization, just because of the scope of their organization and their customer base etc. and sanitizer sale is going quite well. but you know what it is leading to other sales as well it gives us in the door and it allows us to that we mentioned earlier, it's giving us in front of prospects we never been in front of before, it is giving us some sort of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. i think on our last call, we spoke about really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before. and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant.
but it also now they're talking to us about first aid. then they're talking to us about fire and other rental products, so. it's those types of urgent needs, allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it open some eyes and we're able to sell more. so it's really encouraging.

yeah. first of all, there is a lot of uncertainty still out there. we like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. but it certainly helps, plus have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. i think that normally in a normal environment, with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions. we're looking for what we can do, relative to investing back in the business, dividends and share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders' overall return. and i would say that, as things become a little more clearer, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process, and i think we've got a pretty good track record with how we manage those things for our shareholders and i would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon, if we will vaccine that will work at some point and get back to a more normal environment.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks scott. does that include capex getting back to normal run rate? it was like $30 million in the quarter, that's i think less than half of what you did last year? would you expect that to get back, just as i am thinking about my models?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i'd say this. i don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in capex in the second quarter, most of the time capex is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. we do have some capacity you know, in markets with the ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. so i don't know that the growth capex is going to be necessary in the second quarter. we get out much beyond that, it's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict, but i can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more normal capex spend, and that is -- means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst

scott schneeberger of oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning. yeah just curious about the kind of the painpoint endmarkets that you're enduring as well, i think airlines, cruise, maybe a little on gaap. could you give us an idea, just what percent of revenue is being impacted, that would not be in the fiscal second quarter guidance, as anticipated to see improvement? and i know there are different things in those end markets, so it's not that easy to do. but just to give us a feel of how much of the revenues are impacting, that you don't see coming back in the near term? thanks.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
scott, most of that -- those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that'd be hotels and airlines and cruise ships, and even gaming is in there. those revenues were off significantly. in the direct sale business, we think it's going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. i think that those are probably a longer lead time for those to see those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport, flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth.
so i think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. that is all in our guidance, and it's also in our results for the first quarter. i would say that the second quarter, probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did in the first quarter. there may be a few in there that to do a little better than others. but i'd say it's probably -- at this point through the second quarter, more of the same in those segments.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. appreciate that. and then just -- and follow-up to that broadly, i don't think you guys have touched upon erp, and what you're seeing now that that's mostly implemented. so just a quick update on that please, thanks?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
well, our erp is -- we rolled it out across our first phase, in our rental division over the past few years, and we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster, has been a nice impact. our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go to market in some of the key segments has been significant. so we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- those are never funding process, but we're also seeing some really nice advantages there. i'd say one of the bigger is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to them. so that's -- customers really value that, especially in an environment like this, where you can deliver, when you say you will or faster, in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that, and that's a big advantage for us.
operator
toni kaplan of morgan stanley has our next question.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. just regarding the upcoming election, what are your thoughts on potential impacts on your business, depending on the outcome? i was thinking of it as maybe under a trump win, seems like bringing back some manufacturing jobs into the u.s. could be good, but maybe higher tariffs could be a potential offset? is that the right way to think about it? and how are you thinking about the puts and takes of a biden win?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yeah, i mean there is a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. i would say that the u.s. economy, not just us, but the u.s. economy will be affected, depending on which candidate wins, and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. in a biden administration, more business regulation could slow down businesses' ability to continue to grow. higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share, and then obviously the impact of the overall stock market. and as you said, you know, president trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. but anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. so i think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of american industry, that as american industry goes, we will go with it. i will say this, i am confident, because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought into the u.s. economy, that we can manage through this, that we will manage through it, as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of proving that we can do that, and so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company. i think that there may be some short-term differences, that could come to bear, depending on who wins.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and just as a follow-up, just looking at the balance sheet, you had a decent sized inventory build the last two quarters. just wanted to understand, what's causing the increase? is that preparation for an eventual recovery, and do you expect that to continue? how should we be thinking about that going forward?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
toni, it's todd. we see our balance sheet as an advantage. we seeing our ability to distribute as an advantage, and our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term, so that we can help them with those. so in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage, us investing in that inventory, where we have products that our competition does not. and our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf, and we're leveraging it.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and this is scott. much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in a high demand right now. be it hand sanitizer it's in there, you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. it's the actual fluid itself. the container that it comes in, the dispensing units is that we need, the stands and so forth. and so there is a buildup of that inventory. but these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. and we're very confident that because we've been able to do this, and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory.
we talked about one of the examples, i gave earlier on was that we got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect, it would take months to get those. we had another example of a large customer, multi-location customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third to one of our competitors and a third to a third competitor. we implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week.
one of the competitors came back and said, we can't deliver it within their timeframe. so they gave us that third. we did that the next week thousands of stands and the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do. so they're giving us half of that third of the business, and it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. and so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly at a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you very much.

shlomo rosenbaum of stifel nicolaus.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi. thank you very much for taking my questions. see, you have seen labor intensive businesses hiring is really indicative of what companies think is coming in term of spike in demand. and i know you guys had a hiring freeze, not that long ago looking at your open positions now between 1,600 and 1,700 open positions. could you just discuss, is that what a normal amount of positions you'd have open if there were not a pandemic, if this a higher amount because there's a catch-up, is there a lower amount, how should i think of this in terms of indicating what you guys are thinking about?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
shlomo, this is todd. yeah, so i can't answer you specific, i don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. but if i can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. and we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, which are the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people. and we're matching it up appropriately. so we see -- look forward to q2, q3 and q4 and we see demand continue to increase.
we're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they -- what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election and all these items. but we are investing for the future, and we're bringing them back because many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our deposit trends.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. and then may if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking of the business units during last quarter, you guys gave a little bit more detail on that in terms of the next quarter. i don't know if you're willing to talk at that granular level this quarter as well.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we -- so, shlomo is -- you were a little hard to hear. i think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance? and shlomo, i would say that, first of all, the guidance encompasses all of what i'm going to mention. but todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. but we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that todd talked a bit about.
in our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and scott talked a little bit about, these are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. and so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. and so our expectation is, we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in q2, but still very, very good results. we are very excited about that business.
the fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. and that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend lines. and then lastly, scott talked a little bit about our direct sale business, which was down 47% in the third quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. so that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter keeping in mind that it is -- that at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement, and nice sequential improvement of that. so again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well.
did that answer your question, shlomo?
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much.

good day everyone and welcome to the cintas' quarterly earnings results conference. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to paul adler, cintas' vice president, treasurer and investor relations. please go ahead.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer & investor relations
thanks april, and good morning and thank you for joining us. with me today is scott farmer, cintas' chairman of the board and chief executive officer; todd schneider, executive vice president and chief operating officer; and mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. we will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. after our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements, that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially, from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points, contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to scott farmer.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. this continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services. and they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough, for their truly impressive achievements.
before we get into the financial results, i'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you have a better understanding of our business. the hospital system in michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. these garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. the hospitals had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. the hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource to procurement and laundering to cintas, so they could concentrate on patient care.
another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. due to their satisfaction with the service, they are in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. in california, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. in addition, our first aid business is providing them with a $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. through another university system in california, our first aid division is providing over 1 million face masks.
a restaurant chain, that has been a customer since 2007, had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. in talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted for service frequencies and inventories, in partnership with them. they were so pleased with the way that we treated them, that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants.
a casino customer in ohio recently reopened after being dormant, due to covid-19 restrictions. in order to conduct business in the new environment, the casino added rental mask services and additional items, to increase cleaning protocols, including dusk mats and microfiber mops and towels. and, a city government in texas was a no programmer, until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. they were so happy with the execution, that we gained their trust to provide some of their personal protective equipment needs as well. they were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days.
these examples are just a handful of the many, and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, remains robust. scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term, reach long-term benefits. our net promoter scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction, have never been higher.
earning the trust of the customer enables further penetration and cross-selling, and our supply chain and service network are competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers, and add new customers, by procuring and providing items in short supply. our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday, by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance, has never resonated more, than it does today. a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. we are well positioned for this new normal.
i'll turn the call over to mike now, for a commentary on the financial results. mike?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks scott and good morning. our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. earnings per diluted share or eps were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. organic revenue, adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. organic revenue for the first aid and safety services' operating segment increased 17.1%.
gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million, decreased 2.7%. gross margin as a percentage of revenue, 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter, and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. fiscal '21 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses, as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including, discretionary spending.
operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. our fiscal first quarter contained one more work day than the prior year first quarter. one more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin, due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense, being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. in addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. first quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt-to-ebitda. our balance sheet is strong. we have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion.
for financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. one more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. one more workday also benefits operating margin and eps. fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better, in comparison to fiscal '20, due to one more day of revenue. in fiscal '20, each quarter contained 65 workdays. in fiscal '21, workdays by quarter, are 66 in q1, 65 in q2, 64 in q3 and 66 in q4. please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
before turning the call over to todd schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, i want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. due to the continuing covid-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. therefore we are not providing annual guidance at this time. however, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and eps to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. we expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%, and we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22%, compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter.
i'll now turn it over to todd.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you, mike. before i review the business results, i'd like to build off of scott's comments. while the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experience a continued improvement in results through the quarter. the majority of our existing customers that reopened and our employee partners worked diligently in partnership with these businesses, to get them ready for the workday. despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business, before the covid-19 pandemic started, because of the virus' impact on health and the economy.
in keeping with the cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency, to offset these headwinds. significant opportunities for new revenues exist, because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students patients, etc, that they will remain healthy and safe. additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks, that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. the value we provide businesses, has never been more evident. in fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, covid-19 procurement taskforces, and hospitality, cleanliness councils.
there is greater demand for services and products we already provide, such as [technical issues] in other areas, demand is so attractive, that we are providing new services and products, made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, salesforce and cash flow. these include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand and dispenser service, and sanitizing spraying service.
with that, i'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our businesses. the uniform rental and facility services operating segment, includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. this segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%.
our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense, as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses.
our first aid and safety services operating segment, includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. this segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million, the organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. the first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% for the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's first quarter, were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. the uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. uniform direct sale however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
all other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. organic revenue declined 22.2%. the fire business organic revenue declined 5.3%, due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. the uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers, largely falls within this segment. these industries continue to be among the hardest hit, by the pandemic.
that concludes our prepared remarks. we are happy to answer your questions.

[operator instructions]. and we'll first hear from seth weber of rbc capital markets.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody. hope everybody's keeping well. i had a couple of questions on the first aid safety business. i guess maybe mike, can you just talk to how -- do you feel like you're still seeing large one-time sales in that category, or do you feel like that this is -- the growth rate there has been reset to a higher level, kind of on a sustainable basis? and then on a follow-up question, can you just talk -- give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply chain, on the cost side? i think todd called out some higher cogs for some ppe, is that, do you think just a temporary issue or will that -- is that sort of the new normal, just on the cost side? thank you.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
seth, this is scott. i'll take the first part of that. i'll let todd take the second part of that. on first aid and safety, i think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it, is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of ppe through the first aid business, are similar to what happens in the direct sale business, when we sell a big new customer. there is a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level, and so we are seeing that in the first quarter, we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business, that are now moving into that maintenance level. does it mean that there aren't other customers out there, that we can find and identify? but i think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter, is pandemic hit, and so i would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode, on those type of things.
i would say that probably means that, we may not grow in the high teens in first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
seth. this is todd. completely agree with scott there is, you kind of end up in a large first order, and then there is some maintenance mode there. but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. they are in great demand for some of these products out there; gloves, mats, and hand sanitizer, etc, so we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them. but we are encouraged still that, we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets; it's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, but we are also anxious to see the cogs to moderate back to -- closer to where it was before.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and maybe, seeing a pickup in the cabinet business and stuff, i know that, that you talked about some strength and i think --
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
seth, you sound a bit muffled. can you start that question over please?
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sure sorry. i was just wondering, if you have seen a pickup in the cabinet business? i know last quarter, you talked about -- you know that you're having challenges getting into facilities and things like that. has the cabinet side of the business picked up as well?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, well, there's -- great question seth. there is -- our new cabinet sales are going quite well. but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. they are close. so that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. but long term, while we've pivoted helping our customers and long term, we are quite bullish on the direction of the organization.
seth weber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
super. okay, thank you very much guys. i appreciate it.
operator
[operator instructions]. next we'll hear from george tong of goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi thanks. good morning. you talked about healthy growth for scrubs and isolation gowns in the healthcare vertical, both among existing customers and in the no programmer market. at this point, what percentage of revenue is being generated by healthcare customers? and how quickly is this vertical growing?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
george, this is scott. when we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment, that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sale business, and obviously some uniform rental and fs business. it represents about 7% of our total revenue now. we are excited about what we see in that in that segment. healthcare represents about 70% of gdp, and so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. the scrub rental business and these isolation gowns, and from your perspective, if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, i think you'd be [indecipherable] that these isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients, to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that. no need to get into a whole separate category on that.
but we're excited on what we see there. covid has brought a realization to healthcare providers, that taking -- of what wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home, may not be the right approach and they're looking for ways to outsource, managing those programs for them, and we really like the position that we're in. i would say that, healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. and so we remain very optimistic about this segment.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and as revenues begin to recover over the near to intermediate term, can you provide some perspectives on what you expect for incremental margin flow through, particularly as operating leverage begins to kick in, and you start to see utilization and capacity rates recover?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah i think george from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past -- we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. clearly we've exceeded that in this first quarter. longer term, that's still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow, and we are managing the number of salespeople that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need. and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue, as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period.

hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you. my first question is maybe for scott. i know you've touched on some examples of the net new business, sort of in your prepared remarks. but maybe if you could just talk about, how the sales cycle today compares to pre-covid, in converting some of these customers? i assume healthcare has accelerated given some of your comments, maybe even foodservice. but maybe if you could just talk about, how that cycle differs today, versus pre-covid? it seems like it has accelerated? i think you've touched on outsourcing potentially accelerating coming out of this period?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to provide a little color there and todd may want to chime in, as we go through this. but you know, the pre-covid we had decisionmakers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. i think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services, certainly shortened that sales cycle. decisions were made more quickly. it's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive risks, but in many cases it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services that they needed to fulfill a customer's order. i am proud to say that, we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory, and so we've been reasonably successful and being able to help these companies out. as we look at sales productivity among our sales force, where we have been through the entire covid period. the selling at very impressive productivity rates are very high historically, we like to see that happen, we think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company, and so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market trying to make reasonably quick decisions, and we think we can do very well in that regard.
todd i don't know if you have anything to add?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, hamzah it's good question. it really varies dramatically based upon who you're calling on, the products you're selling. our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. and i've been really impressed by how they've been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like in the way. but we have products and services that people really need to -- i'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests in their customers, how we want to describe it students, their patients. when you have those available it does shorten the sales cycle because there is sometimes when we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go.
and so, again there are so many different sales process is going on at any one time. it's tough to say, make a suiting statement, but i think generally speaking yeah, it's setting up because of the urgency of making sure people were taking care of, and we are again blessed to be in a good spot with those products and services and that creates confidence in our people and our customers and showing in the productivity.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then just my follow-up question is just on the hygiene business. could you maybe talk about the outlook there, but particularly what is your value proposition in hygiene versus some larger competitors that may be moved into that market first? i know your product looks nicer than ecolab from the outside, but hand sanitizers and such, but well maybe just give us a sense of the value prop you have in that business, because it seems like a newer business for you, even pre-covid obviously it's accelerated today.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hamzah, i'll start then and scott can feel free to jump in. and we're -- and we appreciate your comment on our products. we were -- we invest a heck of a lot into our r&d to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, put a lot of investment in it and we have -- we've been in the hygiene business for, i'll call it decades, right. it's just that we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, september 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security, and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that is -- that has been something that's been positive for our business.
so our customers love the fact that we have availability. we've attracted products. we have a improved inventory distribution system, very fair approach to how we handle things and we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck, they can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs. we are able to, because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and it allows for us to be able to inspect, what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more box. so that's the route infrastructure and obviously distribution center to our system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, hamzah, i'd say it this way, just to echo what todd said, the -- what we do that most of our other competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. most of the time our customer who is finding it from a supply house or traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory, then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. they're out of supply for maybe a few days, and that sort of thing. and they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them.
and restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. and when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. so i think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
great. very clear. thank you so much.

manav patnaik of barclays.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, good morning gentlemen. my first question is, clearly there's a winning a lot of new mandates here. in the past, you talked about how non-programmers really continue to give the new sales. is that sales, does that focus shifting more now, because i guess the covid driven demand. and is it -- are you seeing competition at the same kind of -- list as well or there is an element that you guys just winning some of that new shares as well if that how it phases?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so manav, i think you're asking is -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from no programmers and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period, and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. and you know, i'll start. as todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. and we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago, but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to just hygiene, messaging, which is resonating so well.
and so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past, and when we get our foot in the door, good things can happen when they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. and so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter, but more so in this first quarter.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
and frankly that was part of the question of the sales cycle. the sales cycle is certainly a big set up just because we are selling more no programmers. there is no hurdle to get over to sell something. they can buy immediately. and that's been very positive for us. as mike mentioned, we're selling into different variety of different prospects, and we're also because of the urgency, and the intensity of what is important to these businesses, we're able to get it levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past, quicker.
so that again speed things up. when decision makers hear our value proposition, it resonates. and so there is -- we certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, and mainly for our customers. but there is some shine of light, it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have, the value that we provide and giving us an audience at high levels quickly.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
okay, that make sense. and in terms of at least examples you provided it sounds like there is relaxed situation that is coming to you guys for the offerings, but maybe just on the flip side, can you just talk about your, kind of small business customers, and how they just kind of survived more? do you anticipate risk further down the road if there is not a lockdown that they can even survive? just any color there would be appreciated.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. obviously that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. it's different in each line, because of various local government, so state governments that have put restrictions in place. i'd say generally speaking, the small customers that are open right now, are weathering this as a general statement pretty darn well. i think it says a lot about the american entrepreneurial spirit, to see them able to do the things that they're doing, with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. but some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet, because of various restrictions that have been put on them, for customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. so you know, clearly, i think for the american economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received, so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating into a -- sort of a new normal, but a normal that allows them to operate more traditional fashion.

andy wittmann with baird.
andrew wittmann -- rw baird -- analyst
great, thanks. i have a question and then a follow-up question. i mean clearly here in the quarter, you saw quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the organic trends, in talking about the rental segment, i guess, in particular. and i'm just curious if you could give a little bit more detail here, because when we look at the guidance for next quarter, and suggest that revenues will be down 5% or 6% year-over-year and that's not too dissimilar from what you saw here in the quarter. so how has the month-over-month trends progressed, in comparison to what the implied revenue outlook is, and just any color that you have in terms of your visibility in this, and how you chose to select this range, with all the uncertainty, is it conservative or other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
andy, this is todd. good question. certainly, this has been an unusual environment. there was 20 million jobs that were lost, seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the very early portion of the summer. and then, as you've seen then, the summer that we are on, things moderated a bit and jobs returned. and there are still 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. so that has certainly impacted our business. we need more businesses to come back. we are still guiding toward sequential growth from q1 to q2, we do a one less workday in q2 versus q1. and we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers, of what we're providing. but it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. but we're very much looking forward to q2, q3 and q4, and we like the trend lines that we're seeing.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
maybe i'll offer a couple, one is, scott talked a little earlier about the first aid and safety large personal protective equipment sales, that kind of turning into maintenance a little bit. so keep that in mind. another point i'll make is, if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as q2, you're talking about $1.720 million. and so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it, does look to nice sequential improvement. and keep in mind, the last point i'll make is, last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well.
and so we have put it all together, echoing what todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment, and one that is -- that still contains a fair amount of -- i'll say, lack of clarity, let's say. and so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement.
andrew wittmann -- rw baird -- analyst
thanks mike for that, that's good perspective. i want to also kind of ask on the cost side here. anytime you've got basically ebitda up against declining revenue, that's a very surprising and very expensive, very good outcome for the company. we're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking, if there was anything one-time either positively or negatively. in other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that, that were recognized in the quarter that need to treated back in here, as the year progresses, or other things if you continue to do some level of restructuring, certainly, that was a big factor in the fourth quarter. it sounded like you had it most mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carryover in the first quarter. but mike, i was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over 100% here, on a go-forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, i'll start that. i wouldn't out any specific one-time items. but as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity and we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze, and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. and as the quarter went on, you know revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. and so, we started to bring -- we started to hire back revenue producing positions, and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. but in the first quarter -- in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected.
i'll point to a couple of things though, within the quarter. energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. so we certainly got a little bit of a help there. we talked a little bit about discretionary spending. if you think about travel, that was down about 100 basis points. we are itching to get out to visit customers in our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly, but some of that will get leverage with better revenue momentum as well.
and then the third thing i'll say is last year, you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. we kind of settled back into our normal range, and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. all in all, though, andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. and it also shows that as we move out of this, we have -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, etc.

andrew steinerman.
andrew steinerman -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, it's andrew. i just wanted to get a little more clarification about monthly trends? i definitely understand we are in uncertain times, and there are still many jobs to return to the workplace yet. i just wasn't sure, if when you were talking about year-over-year organic revenue declines in rental, if you saw our september, meaning what we've already experienced, continue to narrow from august, so our clients narrowing in september year-over-year versus august, or have we already seen kind of september decline sort of hover with august. so it's really is the uncertainty in like october and november, or you've seen some hovering in september?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. and certainly todd talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. and so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer, and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. but our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that, our -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. and so september, while moderated from let's say june and early july is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it.

next we'll hear from gary bisbee of bank of america.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys. good morning. i guess i love to go back to the margins a bit more. so you obviously you've done a great job cutting costs and deferring some investment. and i heard your earlier answer the earlier question about sort of what helped it this quarter. but can you give us any sense of how to think about the cadence of costs coming back? do you envision the ability to manage that pretty tightly with sequential improvement in revenue or are there some costs at some point that could come back more quickly?
and i guess as part of that, have you identified anything within your cost reduction efforts to-date that you think could turn into a more permanent or sustainable cost reductions for the business?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
gary, this is scott. first of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs and we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization. so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back online. that may be trucks that have been and therefore service reps that had been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen in through the first quarter.
some of that is coming back online as a result of that, that's driving some production labor to produce the goods. we're bringing on some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. in the second quarter we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some tv advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. so these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there in front of customers and prospects, but we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs.
are there things that we look at and say we maybe we don't need those or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? we're always looking for those kind of things. and that is part of the culture that we have as a company, and when we find them we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those costs out of the organization. i think it's there, nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter, but there will be some things that will change the way we operate new business moving forward.
we're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been, and i think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and realize what else can we do to get efficient. so i think we've done a really good job. and my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. that said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that i think for the long-term, intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow are necessary expenses.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all of which are within the guidance.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hey gary, this is todd. as scott talked about growing is expenses, it's an investment. and i think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down meaning as the economy kind of went off the cliff. and we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully that continues. and i don't think it's a whole lot more fund to manage on way up, and it is a way down, and in our people feel that way. and when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, it is -- as scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens.
you evaluate the organization different, and one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers. do they want us there? should we be there in person as much? what is the team's call or zoom call or facetime or whatever it is, business moves fast and we are evaluating that, our customers are evaluating that. but it does allow things to speed up, and will that have a long-term impact? it will, we shall see. i think certainly in the short and intermediate future, that's what we see.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thanks. and then just a follow-up. you talked a lot about the sanitizer sales and a big opportunity there. is it right, is that all flows through the hygiene and facilities business within rentals? and if that is right, can you give us any sense sort of how well that's doing? and maybe what the underlying rental revenue trend is today, or how it's been trending, excluding that hygiene business? just trying to get a sense if that's doing a lot worse and hygiene is just absolutely, killing it today. any color on that would be great. thank you.
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, great, gary. so the hygiene, excuse me, the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rental certainly our first aid customers as well. we saw sanitizer whether it's in various forms. so that is -- so you'll see it in both, but predominantly in the rental organization, just because of the scope of their organization and their customer base etc. and sanitizer sale is going quite well. but you know what it is leading to other sales as well it gives us in the door and it allows us to that we mentioned earlier, it's giving us in front of prospects we never been in front of before, it is giving us some sort of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. i think on our last call, we spoke about really large bank that we had hardly done any business with before. and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant.
but it also now they're talking to us about first aid. then they're talking to us about fire and other rental products, so. it's those types of urgent needs, allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it open some eyes and we're able to sell more. so it's really encouraging.

next we'll hear from tim mulrooney of william blair.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning. two quick ones on the balance sheet here, guys. first of all, you've got a lot of cash piling up on the balance sheet here. is this just a prudent step to have actually liquidity given the macro uncertainty? and can you share what's your capital allocation priorities are for this year?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. first of all, there is a lot of uncertainty still out there. we like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. but it certainly helps, plus have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. i think that normally in a normal environment, with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions. we're looking for what we can do, relative to investing back in the business, dividends and share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders' overall return. and i would say that, as things become a little more clearer, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process, and i think we've got a pretty good track record with how we manage those things for our shareholders and i would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon, if we will vaccine that will work at some point and get back to a more normal environment.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks scott. does that include capex getting back to normal run rate? it was like $30 million in the quarter, that's i think less than half of what you did last year? would you expect that to get back, just as i am thinking about my models?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i'd say this. i don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in capex in the second quarter, most of the time capex is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. we do have some capacity you know, in markets with the ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. so i don't know that the growth capex is going to be necessary in the second quarter. we get out much beyond that, it's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict, but i can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more normal capex spend, and that is -- means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us.

scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning. yeah just curious about the kind of the painpoint endmarkets that you're enduring as well, i think airlines, cruise, maybe a little on gaap. could you give us an idea, just what percent of revenue is being impacted, that would not be in the fiscal second quarter guidance, as anticipated to see improvement? and i know there are different things in those end markets, so it's not that easy to do. but just to give us a feel of how much of the revenues are impacting, that you don't see coming back in the near term? thanks.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
scott, most of that -- those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that'd be hotels and airlines and cruise ships, and even gaming is in there. those revenues were off significantly. in the direct sale business, we think it's going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. i think that those are probably a longer lead time for those to see those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport, flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth.
so i think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. that is all in our guidance, and it's also in our results for the first quarter. i would say that the second quarter, probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did in the first quarter. there may be a few in there that to do a little better than others. but i'd say it's probably -- at this point through the second quarter, more of the same in those segments.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. appreciate that. and then just -- and follow-up to that broadly, i don't think you guys have touched upon erp, and what you're seeing now that that's mostly implemented. so just a quick update on that please, thanks?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
well, our erp is -- we rolled it out across our first phase, in our rental division over the past few years, and we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster, has been a nice impact. our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go to market in some of the key segments has been significant. so we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- those are never funding process, but we're also seeing some really nice advantages there. i'd say one of the bigger is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to them. so that's -- customers really value that, especially in an environment like this, where you can deliver, when you say you will or faster, in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that, and that's a big advantage for us.

toni kaplan of morgan stanley has our next question.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. just regarding the upcoming election, what are your thoughts on potential impacts on your business, depending on the outcome? i was thinking of it as maybe under a trump win, seems like bringing back some manufacturing jobs into the u.s. could be good, but maybe higher tariffs could be a potential offset? is that the right way to think about it? and how are you thinking about the puts and takes of a biden win?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yeah, i mean there is a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. i would say that the u.s. economy, not just us, but the u.s. economy will be affected, depending on which candidate wins, and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. in a biden administration, more business regulation could slow down businesses' ability to continue to grow. higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share, and then obviously the impact of the overall stock market. and as you said, you know, president trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. but anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. so i think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of american industry, that as american industry goes, we will go with it. i will say this, i am confident, because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought into the u.s. economy, that we can manage through this, that we will manage through it, as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of proving that we can do that, and so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company. i think that there may be some short-term differences, that could come to bear, depending on who wins.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and just as a follow-up, just looking at the balance sheet, you had a decent sized inventory build the last two quarters. just wanted to understand, what's causing the increase? is that preparation for an eventual recovery, and do you expect that to continue? how should we be thinking about that going forward?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
toni, it's todd. we see our balance sheet as an advantage. we seeing our ability to distribute as an advantage, and our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term, so that we can help them with those. so in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage, us investing in that inventory, where we have products that our competition does not. and our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf, and we're leveraging it.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and this is scott. much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in a high demand right now. be it hand sanitizer it's in there, you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. it's the actual fluid itself. the container that it comes in, the dispensing units is that we need, the stands and so forth. and so there is a buildup of that inventory. but these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. and we're very confident that because we've been able to do this, and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily because we have inventory.
we talked about one of the examples, i gave earlier on was that we got a very large account because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect, it would take months to get those. we had another example of a large customer, multi-location customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third to one of our competitors and a third to a third competitor. we implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week.
one of the competitors came back and said, we can't deliver it within their timeframe. so they gave us that third. we did that the next week thousands of stands and the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do. so they're giving us half of that third of the business, and it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. and so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly at a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you very much.

hi. thank you very much for taking my questions. see, you have seen labor intensive businesses hiring is really indicative of what companies think is coming in term of spike in demand. and i know you guys had a hiring freeze, not that long ago looking at your open positions now between 1,600 and 1,700 open positions. could you just discuss, is that what a normal amount of positions you'd have open if there were not a pandemic, if this a higher amount because there's a catch-up, is there a lower amount, how should i think of this in terms of indicating what you guys are thinking about?
todd schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
shlomo, this is todd. yeah, so i can't answer you specific, i don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. but if i can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. and we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, which are the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people. and we're matching it up appropriately. so we see -- look forward to q2, q3 and q4 and we see demand continue to increase.
we're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they -- what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election and all these items. but we are investing for the future, and we're bringing them back because many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our deposit trends.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. and then may if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking of the business units during last quarter, you guys gave a little bit more detail on that in terms of the next quarter. i don't know if you're willing to talk at that granular level this quarter as well.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we -- so, shlomo is -- you were a little hard to hear. i think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance? and shlomo, i would say that, first of all, the guidance encompasses all of what i'm going to mention. but todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business, and we continue to see a nice trend line even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. but we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that todd talked a bit about.
in our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and scott talked a little bit about, these are -- these big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. and so they happen, but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. and so our expectation is, we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in q2, but still very, very good results. we are very excited about that business.
the fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. and that business continues to perform well and continue to move on an improving trend lines. and then lastly, scott talked a little bit about our direct sale business, which was down 47% in the third quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. so that's our -- that's the way we view the second quarter keeping in mind that it is -- that at the midpoint and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement, and nice sequential improvement of that. so again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well.
did that answer your question, shlomo?
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much.

good day, everyone, and welcome to the cintas' quarterly earnings results conference call. [operator instructions]. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to mr. paul adler, vice president, treasurer and investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
paul f. adler -- vice president-treasurer and investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today is scott farmer, cintas' chairman of the board and chief executive officer; todd schneider, executive vice president and chief operating officer; and mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
we will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2021. after our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the sec. i'll now turn the call over to scott farmer.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. good morning, everyone. the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic continues and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. our fiscal third quarter, which included the months of december, january and february was particularly challenging. covid-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on december 1st to a peak of a little over 300,000 on january, 8th. not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably.
in december, the u.s. economy posted job losses again after seven straight months of job gains. the operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. the snow and ice storm in february caused extensive energy blackouts in the u.s., especially in the state of texas. despite a very difficult operating environment in late december and into january, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis.
on top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. we provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by covid-19.
looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower covid-19 case counts to be the foundation for improved operating environment. we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. however, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- the service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter.
mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. regardless of the operating environment, our employee partners worked with urgency to get businesses ready for the workday. companies want to open their doors every day with confidence that they're ready for their employees and their customers.
we helped businesses achieve that objective by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. for over 90 years, cintas has accomplished getting businesses ready for the workday in numerous ways, including providing hygienically clean uniforms to auto manufacturers, for example, so that the workers can safely build their cars. restroom supplies and services to professional services firms so bathrooms are ready for use by employees and clients. hygienically laundered towels to coffee chains so baristas can serve their coffee lovers. first aid products to restaurants to address the cuts and burns of the kitchen group, and test, inspection and repair services of fire extinguishers and alarm systems to facilities' managers to protect employees and customers from danger.
the covid-19 pandemic assured in for business a new era of readiness. getting ready for the workday today also includes taking actions to prevent and reduce transmission of viruses and bacteria. our solutions for getting businesses ready for the workday include providing hygienically clean scrubs to dentist offices, because hygienists feel vulnerable taking them home to launder. sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes for food manufacturers, for instance, so that they can routinely sterilize surfaces, hand sanitizer dispensing units to universities so employees, professors and students can keep their hands clean. masks and gloves to city, counties and state governments to protect employees when interacting with the public. and hygienically cleaned isolation gowns to hospitals to safeguard the care givers from the contaminants of the sick.
our value proposition of helping businesses get ready for the workday has arguably never been more relevant. every business has a need that cintas can help fulfill. and in this unpredictable environment, requiring new and increased demands, businesses appreciate the certainty of cintas. the cintas' tag line of ready for the workday helps describe what we do. it also helps describe who we are. our employees, whom we call partners are always ready for the workday whether it's in the best of times or in the most uncertain of times.
our partners are honored to be deemed essential. they are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems and ready to be counted on to deliver, and they do.
now i'll turn the call back over to mike for commentary on our financial results. mike?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott. our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. earnings per diluted share or eps were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. the organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was also flat. organic revenue for the first aid and safety services operating segment increased 17.7%.
gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. this increase was despite one less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year.
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20.
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. and again, eps was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter.
our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to ebitda. we have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. during the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of cintas' common stock under our buyback programs. earlier this week, on march 15th, cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends.
for financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. one more workday will benefit fiscal '21 full revenue growth by 40 basis points. one more workday also benefits operating margin and eps. fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. in fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. this fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on year-over-year and sequential basis.
for our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion and diluted eps to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing covid-19 cases. we are encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus and business reopenings and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter.
we expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5%, after being flat in the third quarter. however, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results.
our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest gdp decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of covid-19 cases. while the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth will benefit in part from an easier comparison. our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the covid-19 coronavirus. these included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense.
excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. all these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. the additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory mostly in the uniform direct sale business, where customers and some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter.
i'll now turn the call over to todd schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses.
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks, mike. the uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue.
our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. this segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. the first aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48% in last year's third quarter. the difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix.
in the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses.
also note that on a sequential basis, first aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. all other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year.
the fire business organic revenue increased 3.5%, the uniform direct sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. these industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
that concludes our prepared remarks. we are happy to answer your questions.

operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions]. our first question will come from tim mulrooney with william blair.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, scott, todd, mike and paul. my question, i just have one for you this morning is on the uniform rental segment's, operating margins in this business have ticked up nicely in 2021 and i think some of that was from structural cost savings and maybe some temporary cost savings. moving forward, would you expect uniform operating margins kind of normalize toward that pre-pandemic run rate over time? or would you expect the operating margins to kind of settle at a somewhat higher level than the pre-pandemic run rate? thank you.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, tim, this is scott. i'd start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the p&l. how much of that returns, i'm not sure. i mean, we wanted an awful lot, we don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is traveling into one town to accomplish that. some of that will happen, but i -- lot of that probably won't.
but i'd say that in our sequential -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, i think improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the p&l, that might be growth routes in the rental division, as an example. you know, jobs that would help us with growth, additional salespeople, sales training, additional head count in the production operations to be able to process things.
so i wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but i would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins, as we add sales volume back on to the p&l. and over time, i think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above, probably above where we were pre-pandemic.
so that's -- that's how i would answer that. is that -- does that help you?
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful, honest thoughtful answer. i appreciate that, scott. thanks for taking my question.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thanks tim.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew steinerman with j.p. morgan.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, there. a question for todd. when you think of rentals being flat in the just reported quarter, could you just give us a sense of you know, how much ancillary services is contributing versus are you seeing improvement in uniform rentals as well? and a quick comment on how dependent are you in some of the areas like restaurants that are still kind of opening up ahead?
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
andrew, great question. you know, we had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around pp&e and etc., other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in q3. that was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. so that was significant for us. to the tune of about $45 million more than in q2, we don't see that as repeating, that level repeating in q4. but we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back.
so you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in q4 over q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. as far as restaurants, etc., that's certainly a component of our business. we are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks actively increasing, consumer spending increasing. we think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that the small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm that their demand starts to pick up even more.
so we're encouraged by what we see.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andrew, if i could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that -- $45 million that todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the first aid segment. you saw our first aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. and so we are seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers and we're doing our best to meet those demands. so it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks, good morning. if you exclude the $45 million in ppe lift in the uniform rentals business, could you perhaps talk about how revenue trends progressed moving through fiscal 3q?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, george. but to mike's point that $45 million was spread out across all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift. but relative to what happened in q3, i think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, this year was as well.
it has two holidays in it with christmas and new year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days those holidays fall on, where there is always a potential weather issues with the snow and ice storms and things like that. and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with the increasing covid cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does.
i would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. covid cases were on the rise. i've said that, earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in seven months in december. so december and into january, really even into february, we saw a very difficult economic environment. but as we got into february, we started to see our recurring revenue start to pick back up, cases were dropping dramatically from -- i want to say maybe the second week in january, the expected restrictions, the governance [phonetic] that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize.
and so, the -- we built some momentum in february that we continue to see as we moved into march. and i think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and just as a follow-up to that, if you look at new business trends and plans for sales force hiring, can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline is building?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're very pleased with our pipeline. our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. we believe that the -- you know, our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. so we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future. there are 16 million or roughly 16 million businesses in the united states and canada and we do business with 1 million of them. and we really like our opportunity as we -- as we approach hopefully the end of this pandemic and a more normalized economy of our ability to attract new customers. so we are -- the pipeline is relatively full and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual team's call or zoom call and being successful in doing it.
so we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. we think we'll be -- we're well positioned to take advantage of that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. my question is a little bit more big picture. pre-covid, i guess your long-term growth rate was sort of 6% to 8% depending on the year. in a post-covid world, and you touched on a little bit of this with some of the ancillary services that may be benefited from the pandemic, which may normalize. but at the same time, you have these newer verticals you've penetrated. there is some structural outsourcing maybe in healthcare, that could be a tailwind. i don't know if that sort of plateaued out or it continues. so when you put all the puts and takes together in a post-covid world, do you expect your growth rate to be better than what it was prior to the pandemic on a normalized basis, as you look out over the next couple of years?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
hamzah, that's tough for us to predict. you know, i'm not sure that i'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post pandemic than we were pre-pandemic. but as i had said, we really like where we're positioned. we've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with net promoter scores are at all time highs. and, we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. we have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. so i'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well positioned and we are excited about the future.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got it.
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
hamzah, i'd like to -- this is todd, just to expand upon what scott's saying. the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide. here's what we know is that, demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. and what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't realize that we offered those types of products and services in the past.
let me be clear, there is nothing positive that came out the pandemic, right? but if there is any silver linings, it's the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them and as scott mentioned that our nps scores are reflecting that. and we think that is a -- the more, the products and services our customers procure from us, the more value we're bringing to them. and we think that is very positive. the other item that i think is important to understand is that, we're going on two years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers.
we have felt very passionate that, that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through the pandemic. and as a result of that, again our customers did really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. we look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach. so hopefully all that color helps.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. that's very helpful. and just my follow-up question, and i'll turn it over. just on the fire business, i know it's a smaller business for you, but it's a good business. could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about scaling that business up? and the reason i ask is, we look at the first aid business and you did zee medical in 2015, and that business scaled up. does fire have the same potential in your mind? and maybe if you could just talk about the competitive dynamic in that business.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we do think fire business has an opportunity to scale up. there are lots and lots and lots of small independent players, there are regional players, there are some pe groups that are doing some regional roll-ups. so there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business, that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage.
it is a very good business. one of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service, be it fire extinguisher, repair and replacement, versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. they have different certification levels that they have to have. so it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street. and us being able to train them to be a first aid service rep, these people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that.
but that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. there is a lot of geography that we would like to expand into, and there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. so we really like that business. and i think over time, we can scale that up to be upsized.
i always tell the division presidents including fire and first aid that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least $1 billion in revenue. and that's what they should be thinking about. and that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth. but we clearly think that both first aid and fire divisions can be over $1 billion in revenue for us.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew wittmann with r.w. baird.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, and thanks for taking my questions. i had one question and then a follow-up. i guess -- and the first question here, maybe mike, over the years cintas' growth has been fairly consistent in the characteristics that comprises between things like price and stocks and new accounts, even retention from -- some extent. i mean in normal times, we have a pretty good sense about how that contributes to your year-over-year growth rate. now that the next few quarters are going to be driven more by a reopening type growth rate, i was wondering if you talk about which of those factors you think will contribute more than their historical percentage to the growth and maybe less, just to understand how you're thinking about how this matters and -- will unfold in the next few months or quarters.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, andrew. boy, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment to operating in the last four quarters and one that's been pretty unpredictable.
you know, i think what we will see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22 is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to a somewhat normalized operations. we were on a nice trajectory of that toward the end of our first quarter of this year and into our second quarter, that certainly took a pause. but we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity.
and so, i think as we look at the next couple of quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. that means, we will take businesses off of a held status in the rental division, we'll start to service first aid cabinets again at a greater pace. we will start to understand the needs, when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important.
so i think it's going to be -- it's going to be more of that. the reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just for my follow-up, i wanted to just talk about inflation a little bit. it's been obviously a lot talked about and it seems like there's a lot of merit given the amount of stimulus that's going to be hitting the system here, it's already hitting the system. so i was hoping mike you could talk a little bit about where inflation could hit you? where you might be hitting it today, or expect to see it tomorrow? obvious areas come to mind, like energy and be curious as to your thoughts on how that impacts the outlook here for the calendar '21.
but also maybe even in some of the products that you're selling in the ancillary business and in first aid, labor, obviously, if you could just address inflation, how you expect it to affect you and your ability to recover it in pricing against a recovering, but still not full bore macro. thanks.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so from a -- i'll say a short-term, we could certainly see changes in gas prices at the pump. we saw sequentially an increase in our energy percentage of about 10 basis points. and that certainly could contribute over the course of the next year.
you know, i think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. we could see as you mentioned, certainly in some of the pp&e, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices, in costs to us, in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year.
and there is probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. but andrew, a really good news in all of that is, we've got great efficiency in our business. and so many times, we were able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. but if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. todd mentioned, we have not liked that idea in the last year. we did not think it's the right thing to do. but, and it's been two years really since we've done it.
but if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. and usually in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs, if we can't offset them within our operations.
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
andrew, this is todd. just to build upon that, every mindset is right on target. we're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. but with all these, whether it's inflation in general or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. we will manage our business, we'll do it so appropriately. but if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. and we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested and we're in hopes that they can continue to withstand and thrive in the new environment.

thank you. our next question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. just wanted to ask about the sap benefits that you are seeing just now that the integration within rentals has been completed. i know we're sort of in an unique period, but i just wanted to see if any of those are coming through now or we should be expecting it going forward just anecdotally any benefits from the sap program. thanks.
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. toni, this is todd. we're seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part, one platform for the entire organization, benefiting our customers in one view of cintas, it's benefiting our locations and the ability to share inventory. our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs, it's been -- it's been quite impactful, and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it, both from the customer but also internally have been very encouraging.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. wanted to also ask about capital allocation, if we hit a period now where demand accelerates, do you expect to be investing more back into the business for organic growth opportunities or m&a and i saw you're buying back some stock in the quarter, so does that get back to historical levels, just what are you thinking about allocating capital?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, if we start with capex, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. so we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. but over time, i think our capex spend as the economy turns around will get back to a more normalized historical type, and it's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance.
so i think we'll continue to see that type of spend. we do generate a lot of cash. we've got a very strong balance sheet. and so, we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. and then obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. we have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue.
and then, yeah, finally, we do have roughly $1 billion left on our authorization, and that is more sort of opportunistic from time to time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. and so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, i think that, you know the board would agree that we would be in a position to buy back some of our stock. we saw a little bit of that in the third quarter when the stock price went down. and so, it -- i think that i wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. it's impressive to get back to flat year-over-year same-day sales, i guess a quarter really before lapping the step down from the pandemic. i wanted to ask about mix within that sales. so, can you give us a sense of how meaningful pp&e sanitizers and other -- and other pandemic driven sales are to the current revenue levels? and so how much the more normal historical mix would still be down right in q3 without that? that's the first question.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, let me start by saying that, things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream, once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there, we come and service it on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth.
so that -- that is, that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. the other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks and things like that are the one-time pp&e sale -- i refer to it as one-time, but it's more of a direct sale that you know, can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs.
but you know, we have -- we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. so it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that, relative to historical average. i'd say, recurring revenue, with the understanding that some of that is, is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where -- it's flat through the quarter.
and we think that, that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully, bring back some of their head count. and i believe that an awful lot of the recurring business like hand sanitizer is here to stay. i have said in the past, and i continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical american walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theater, any place, and isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they've grabbed the door knob going in and out of a public building.
and we're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing, i think that's going to be here to stay. so if i'm right about that as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now.
todd m. schneider -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
gary, it's todd. i think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. it's not new, right. it's just -- it's elevated. and we think it will be -- it maybe -- may not be at the current level, but it will -- it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future or in the near future certainly, and maybe even much further out than that. so that's exciting for us.
we see that, again our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. and many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and now they are cleaning for health. and that's a very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers.
so some very positives coming up.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and if i could just clarify one thing in that response. scott, you said recurring revenues were flat. did you mean sequentially versus q2 or did you mean year-over-year? and if the latter, flat year-over-year, does that imply then that the one time-ish pp&e sales increase year-over-year was similar to the uniform direct sales decrease, which will allow that to be flat? i just want to make sure i understood exactly what you're saying.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
i meant sequentially from the second quarter.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. okay, all right. i mean, what i'm trying to solve for is, how much the traditional businesses are down. i appreciate everything you're saying about this demand persists in the big uptick in sustainable recurring sanitizer sales, but in the traditional pre-pandemic business mix, i mean is that -- is that still down 5% and it's offset by pp&e up 5% or directionally? can you help us understand it? what i'm really trying to sort for is what's at risk of going away over 12 months, 18 months as the -- as the traditional business mix obviously comes roaring back?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, gary, i think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. we don't think that will repeat, but we do believe that these elevated levels relatively elevated levels are here to stay.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and gary to answer what's at risk, we -- it's really premature. scott talked a little bit about the enhanced value proposition of all of these things. and while -- while we may see, we have seen some ups and downs in terms of that product mix in the last three quarters, we don't expect that to go away overnight. this is not going to be a flip of the switch and the pandemic is over.
and so we -- it's hard to say how much of this will continue in the future. will the frequency of sanitizer spray services stay the same frequency as today? will the frequency of our ultra clean services stay the same as today? it's hard to tell. but what we fully expect is that this cleanliness idea and value is going to stick around for a while.
and so trying to dissect the results by product category and other things, we're not going to get into that because it's too early to tell exactly what that future run rate is going to look like.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. i know you talked to kind of the severe weather holiday impact. is there any way to think about how much the weather and the holiday, and then the spike in covid impacted the quarter? and i know it kind of varies across business line, but just any thoughts as to how that impacted the quarter?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i guess the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early december into january, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into february. february was better than january, and obviously if you look at all that the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter.
so you can run that down and then the dip back up. i would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. and so we're -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just, is there any way to think about kind of across your client base, what percentage maybe are engaged right now or [indecipherable] product to service versus where it was last quarter, where that's historically, i know, there's probably seasonality there, but just trying to get a sense of how many clients maybe aren't fully active right now, but you expect to start coming back as [indecipherable] starts to reopen?
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
kevin, i think your question was what percentage of our customers are on hold. so we have -- we had a -- as mike mentioned, i believe a strong run-up in the summer, into the fall. some never came back, some then went on hold. so it's a little difficult to give you an exact number on that. but i can tell you this, we're anxious for those folks to get back. we think that there is an incredible amount of pent-up demand that is in the marketplace, you have that with stimulus checks. and we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the q3, q4 calendar years of the calendar year.
and we think that will be really positive. you put that together with the -- the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers or clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. and so we think all that combined is going to make for a quite a -- quite a good situation.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning. somewhat following up on that last question from kevin. on specifically in your airline cruise line hospitality, the travel segment, can you put any quantification on how much those are down, and more importantly, maybe just a feel for -- if you've seen any improvement on those metrics since the trough were still there. and then i will take away from the answer to that last question that, that is one of the categories that you think in the back half of this calendar year could significantly open up.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
to begin with, most of those -- the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business. and that business is down about 40% over prior year, and as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. for example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port. so the cruise line business has really been affected. there is some travel happening now, particularly sort of vacation travel, sort of the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. and when i say that, i mean they're revenue streams to their -- within their own business. we had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers.
and, but still down 40% is a pretty significant number. and i think that the -- those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer, traveling. i haven't been to the vacation spots in florida, but i understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now.
so i think there is a -- as todd said, a pent-up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go -- get on an airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. and i think that the big, the big trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the u.s. population has a vaccine. how long will it take to get back to pre-covid? that i don't know. it might take a couple of years. but i definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year, if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
all right. thanks for that, scott. my follow-up is, you mentioned earlier, it's been two years since any change in pricing as a -- this as a customer appreciation type strategy. i'm curious as we move into the next fiscal year, what is -- might we see that start to happen, would it be only in specific areas that are seemingly overdue and necessary to cover inflation, or is that a strategy you'll continue to maintain? what would it take, i guess is a question for you to start to get a little bit of sort of with pricing. thanks.
scott d. farmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
scott, thanks for that question. first of all, it's important that you understand it. it's not so much that we do it as -- as a sort of a favor to the customer, but from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic. and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. they needed to add things depending on a customer by customer basis, but a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. so we'd help them with adjustments on their invoices. maybe their entrance mats went from a weekly service to a bi-weekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. and to us, it's the relationship that we have with the customer. we believe we enhanced their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these type of -- you know unfortunate situations.
it was similar in the great recession. we had the experience of doing things then as well, and the lifetime value of a customers we come out of this is significant. they like us, they're willing to -- they trust us, they are more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. they are more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them, and so forth. and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer and that all goes into what we would use and make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer.
so from a price standpoint, yeah, we're calling [phonetic] up on, on two years since we last increased generally speaking last increased our prices on our recurring revenue, and that's particularly in the rental division where that's probably a stronger statement, and more relative to the rental division than others. but we have seen competitors, typical environment pricing environment in our business. and is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers' attention. but the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors' bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer.
we've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. we will look at it in the future on a customer by customer basis, what type of products and services they need. we -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers.
but the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to them about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. and generally speaking, i think that those conversations are going to go well. will that happen in the near future? that i can't tell you, i won't -- i can't tell you yet. a lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. at the pace that we're on right now, i would assume that between that, the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will happen. when? i'm not ready to predict.

i'll now turn the call over to mike hansen.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, paul. our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was one $1.84 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. earnings per diluted share or eps were $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. the organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 13.7%. organic revenue for the first aid and safety services operating segment declined 6.8%.
gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million, compared to $770.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.
selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 30.9% last year. operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million, increased 71.8%. operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. fiscal '20, fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by covid-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. all of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses.
our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. eps was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter.
our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5 times debt-to-ebitda at may 31, 2021. on june 1, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. we have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to-date, we purchased $979 million of cintas common stock under our buyback program. on june 15, 2021, cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends.
for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2021 revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. eps for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. revenue and adjusted eps have grown 50 of the past 52 years. fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year.
for our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7 -- out $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted eps to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. please note the following regarding our guidance. our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. a higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 eps guidance by about $0.85 and eps growth by about 800 basis points. guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform.
we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic related setbacks. for financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21, both fiscal years contains 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter.
i'll now turn the call to paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
thanks, mike. the uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of the uniforms, healthcare scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. while some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses reopening or increasing capacity as covid-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced.
our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. this segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year.
first aids fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison and last year's fourth quarter in response to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. also the first aid cabinet service business was not impacted and so late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. as a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. the first aid segment gross margin was 43% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 46.1% last year. the difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. as we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter. however, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while profitable, personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins in the first aid cabinet servicing business. we expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and get closer to the pre-covid percent of total division revenue.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. all other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. the fire business, organic revenue increased 22.4%. gross margin improved 70 basis points. uniform direct sale business, organic revenue growth rate was 6.2% and gross margin increased 280 basis points.
i'll now turn the call over to todd for our final prepared remarks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, paul. we are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. they conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. we up keep our customers place of business clean, safe and ready for the workday, by providing essential products and services. we procured hard to find and potentially lifesaving items such as face masks and gloves, providing hygienically clean healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. our net promoter scores reached an all time high, because we consistently delivered for our customers, by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. we were again named to the prestigious fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at number 410 on the 2021 list. it's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies.
we allocated capital to improve shareholder return. we paid down debt, reducing interest expense. we increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. we've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years, also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of cintas stock for a total of $979 million. as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental social and governance or esg report. we are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business.
and in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the covid-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted eps. [indecipherable] bank our reporting partners and i'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. the cintas story is one of growth. we've grown revenue and adjusted eps in 50 of the past 52 years. the only exceptions were the great recession years. our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits, double-digit earnings-per-share growth, significant cash generation and prudent deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns.
our prospects for continued growth are great and then result in part from a strong value proposition in a vast total addressable market. we have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the workday. examples include, scrub rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms, more care services including walk-off mats and mops to retailers, first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns, fire protection services to facilities' managers and universities and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitization departments.
the ramping of healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity, plus we are so much more than a uniform company. more than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops. cleaning tools like micro fiber mops and towels. first aid cabinets services, personal protective equipment and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms.
our total addressable market is the 15 million to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. every business has the need cintas can fulfill. additionally, the covid-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities. significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist, because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students patients, etc, that they will remain healthy and safe. the new service since we launched including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray-service have a long runway.
cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. our recent implementation of the sap enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in three main areas. one is operational efficiencies. our route drivers utilized personal route computers, which are similar to a self-front to access data and process transactions real-time. also sap enabled us to have visibility to longer plant stock from inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability be of the sharing and reuse of revenue producing assets and the technology helps us improve working capital, be a tighter management of supply chain inventory. the second benefit is data analytics and enhance business reporting. these result from having the order to cash cycle all in one system. sap enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large dataset, helping us target penetration, cross-selling and pricing opportunities. and the third competitive advantage is improve customer service. through sap our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. we expect the ease of doing business with -- will help us improve customer retention. also, customers can order products and services via sap resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue.
i want say a few more words regarding esg. from the start of our -- from the start of our company in the great depression, the cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices. wash and reuse. we have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. we will continue to expand our esg reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from andrew wittmann with rw baird. please go ahead.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. and thanks for taking my question. scott, congratulations on a great run. it's been a pleasure and we look forward to. so having you associated maybe when we come to cincinnati next time.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
you bet. thank you.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, so i guess getting on to business here a little bit and maybe this is for mike, there has been a lot of focus on inflationary factors and what i heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was that it sounds like you're getting good operating leverage, but i was just hoping you could drill in and talk about some of the key factors. you've talked about in the past, certainly labor is one that's come up a lot broadly across the street. you've talked about some other things like healthcare, travel and others have mentioned merchandise costs. i was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets and talk about the offsets that that you have baked in the guidance, because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly. and so i was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. i'll begin and certainly todd can jump in. but as it relates to guidance, you're right andrew, the implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance, flattish to at the high end, up around 70 basis points. so a pretty good range. and you've heard us talk a lot about, we've made some really great progress, we made some difficult decisions through this pandemic and it be ashamed to go backwards in this -- and this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. and so how do we think about this inflation? certainly labor as you mentioned, andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. and they're really good news for us is we -- we've been working on the labor rates for some time. so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. and over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates and so certainly the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of people, hiring has been a little bit more difficult, but we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. we've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
and i would add to that includes last fiscal year. we raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service -- frontline service personnel. so we don't have a big catch up as a result of that. i know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in the pandemic and because it was a year, they might have a catch-up to make and we don't have that. so i'm happy to say that. but i don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems, but we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this and so we'll be watching that very closely.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
andrew this is todd. it's a great question. we're in a good staffing position. we like where we are there. we like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. and as scott pointed out, the appropriate and even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying the course and doing the right things and taking care of our [indecipherable] partners, because we knew that when we see things coming right and we're committed to it. so that's important to us. certainly other input costs or cost of goods and our supply chain team is working harder than ever and they're doing a great job in managing through their process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which they are doing a great job at and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. but we like the spot we're in and we anticipate getting some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in. we've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that as mike stated, you'll be ashamed to go backwards and we're focused on going forward.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
and andrew maybe i'll add a couple of other items. you saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. we've built that kind of increase into our guidance and certainly there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that will keep our eye on. we are -- we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing and those things will all have positive impacts. from a material cost standpoint, the good news is, many of our rental items are amortized. so when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our p&l and they must -- they have to last for a while, so that they bleed in over time. and so obviously we've got a great global supply chain todd talked about and they adapt and so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment, and i think over the course of the last year, we talked a lot about our supply chain. they've done a great job and we anticipate that they'll continue to do a very good job.
now having said that, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about and we're not immune to inflationary pressures. they are all built into our guidance, but the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for two years, right. and -- but we certainly believe that that is an opportunity for us as we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas, pricing is local, for us it's customer by customer decision and where we believe it makes sense we will do that. and so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes, not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you. i just -- my one follow-up is just trying to get a sense of the reopening benefits that you're getting or expecting on a sequential basis. how much is left after the may quarter into june? is there still businesses that are closed for you or substantially closed where the revenues are so de minimus that they may as well be considered closed? or on a sequential basis, are you starting to feel like things are fairly normal here, june, july time period? thank you.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
so andrew, mike talked about pricing being a local subject, reopening is a local subject as well. but for the most part, most businesses are back. certainly canada is been a little slower to come back, because of vaccination rates and government effects impacts there, but nevertheless, in general, most businesses are back. now, are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? no. and we're committed to helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come back and their customers come back, so they can be -- they can compete in the marketplace. so hopefully that helps.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
i would add, this is scott. i would add that we think that canada will be in a position that the us is sometime in the end of the summer with reopenings, but they are on a steady pace, heading in that direction. the biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are about 7 million fewer people employed right now than they were pre-pandemic. and so there's a lot of room there and i think as federal unemployment benefits subside in september, we hope to see that our customers that are open and be able to get themselves back to full staffing and that'll obviously benefit our business.
operator
thank you. moving on to our next question, we'll go to manav patnaik with barclays capital. please go ahead.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
thank you. good morning guys. so i was just hoping you would help us with the kind of cadence of organic growth by segment. there is still obviously a lot of uncertainty potentially out there. so thank you for giving full year guidance, but i was just hoping, is there anything to call out in terms of modeling the growth rates of the segments?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, manav this is todd. so i think you've seen for our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8% to 7.2% from a growth rate. when you think about obviously, around the vision is our -- by far our largest division, so there will be in that range, but we expect that all of our businesses, i mean, the other businesses, fire, first aid and our direct sale business will all be high single-digit growth businesses in this fiscal year. so we feel very positive about all of them and i look forward to growth in each of those businesses.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
yeah, i think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the first aid business. you saw that their revenue was a little bit lower growth wise they had a decline in the fourth quarter. they had such a strong year last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we may see a little bit of bumpiness through the year but it's a great business, it's improving. we are seeing the recurring business and the mix start to turn back to where we like it. and so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay that makes sense. and then if i can just ask around capital allocation. i mean the buyback was a pretty big number. the $900 million plus that you talked about. can you just help us understand that in the context of the m&a pipeline and what we should expect going forward?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes so amount of our commitment is still number one priority is to invest back into our business to grow the number of customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. our second one is to invest in m&a and we are very focused on m&a, active in that area and it's a big push for us. and then third, if there is consistent with what our approach has been in the past that there is a capital that is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increase in dividend and repurchase of the stock as appropriate.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
manav, this is paul. and i would just wanted to add that, we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance sheet. the cash flow is so strong. we did that buyback and our leverage is 1.5 times as we mentioned in the script. so fortunate to be in a position where -- what we do with the dividend and the buybacks doesn't preclude us from m&a or any other activities, because of the strength of the balance sheet.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
all right, thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan securities. please go ahead.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan securities -- analyst
hi. when you frame fiscal '22 revenue growth, could you just talk about some verticals here, which verticals do you think will be above the average growth of the guide and which verticals might take longer to rebound or maybe there are just kind of slower-growth verticals?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
so, andrew, this is todd. as we look at the business the -- certainly the hospitality business is -- you read about it in the papers, right. you care about bookings, whether the airlines or hotels, etc, that is a vertical that we think will be quite positive this year. the healthcare vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. hospitals are catching up on voluntary type of procedures, which is helping that and we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those areas as well. education, government are both we expect to be quite strong for us. there was a -- the mix of business, i think you will see will be different in those areas, less ppe and more focused on more of a traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. but those key verticals are all positioned well and if you think of them all, they're all positioned quite well, hospitality, probably the best.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan securities -- analyst
are there any slower growth verticals that really is a rising tide here?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, i would say, i don't -- none come to mind, where i would say, yes, slower type of growth. it's just, kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan securities -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies. please go ahead.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is actually ryan gunning filling in for hamzah. my first question just around the fire protection business and if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics there and any opportunity for larger scale m&a in that business kind of similar to what you did with the medical on the first aid side?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, ryan, this is todd. we like our position in the fire business, really i like the fire business. there, we understand the how to go-to-market, and how to make attractive margins in that business, and we're investing. we're investing in m&a, we're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to service all of our customers and we have a national offering in that business, some via subcontracting, but nevertheless a very attractive national approach and we're positioned well. how we -- our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. and there is a good momentum in that business. there was -- you think about it right, it's all, legally you have to have that -- those products and new services. but nevertheless, there was some pent-up demand in it from repairs, right. so if you think about -- someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment and it's -- there is some items that need to be repaired, during a pandemic people more so anxious to spend money on those types of subjects and -- but as we're coming out of it, we're busy. we're busy in that area for many reasons, but one of which is some pent-up demand on repair which is great business for us.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks, that's helpful. and switching over, could you provide any kind of visibility on like how much of your sales you consider today is pandemic, like non-recurring versus recurring, and how you kind of define that?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, great question. so i mean, you think about, let's call ppe items that were really pandemic related. they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic. but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels that they were in fiscal '21. so if you think about our guidance, we think we would be with the ppe that doesn't repeat, if it had -- if it does repeat, then we would be in the -- on the high end above 8% from a internal growth rate. so i think about it that way, about how much is -- will not be repeating, that we don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of businesses. its going to be back close -- much closer to traditional and there is some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've got it toward.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. in the uniform rental segment, you -- can you talk a bit about sales rep productivity trends and how the pipeline is performing especially moving through the quarter and entering fiscal 2022?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
george i'm glad you asked about that. i've been so impressed by our sales organization. the creativity, the flexibility, the urgency and intensity about which we think they go about their jobs and how they have adapted to a crazy environment. and we try to work very hard to position them with great products and services so that people very much want to take their calls, and so we like where that's heading, the mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, george, and -- but there is a strong audience for the -- our sales partners in whom they're calling on, partly because there was -- there were some items that you -- when people were going through the pandemic, they said, hey, i can make a decision on uniforms right now, but i need some critical products to help my business run. we provided critical products and services and it has positioned us now that it's close to businesses getting back to normal, when we say, ok now i'm ready to talk about those types of items. so all that is positive for us, as we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. so that opened some doors and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then switching gears to healthcare and hygiene. those are very strong categories over the past year. can you describe what kind of performance you are expecting structurally from those healthcare and hygiene categories, not just in fiscal 2022 but really looking forward? and then diving into ppe, you talked a little bit about normalization there in first aid mix going back to pre-covid levels over time, which has higher margins. just talk a little bit about that evolving mix as well in the implications for growth and profitability?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. george, i'll start and if mike, scott, paul, whenever jump in, we've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects, what 9/11 did to security 27 -- 20 years ago. and so what we're seeing is there is a greater focus on the health of employees, health of patients, health of guest students and hygiene is big part of that. so we see that as a -- something that will be elevated into the future. and we think that's good for society, that's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. so we think that's going to be something that's elevated hopefully in perpetuity.
as far as ppe normalization, there is -- there was a breakneck pace to get ppe last year, because folks couldn't keep the doors open and in certain cases couldn't work. so there was some real peaks last year that is certainly less. we expect this year the variance, the delta variant, i think brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict, but nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization, you'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, first aid products, hands and cabinets as we say and ppe will be more moderate. now just keep in mind, we've always been in the ppe business. we've always provided these products and services. it's just they were elevated. we will continue to offer them, but as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming from a percentage standpoint our traditional types of vantages and tablets, etc. so hopefully that gives you a little color.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
and george this is paul. i just wanted to add, you mentioned first aid specifically two side. just want to make sure we've provided enough clarity there. that business as mike said alluded to is in a transition period where to todd's point so much ppe was provided. we seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors etc. so it's an outsized percent of the revenue that will transition as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. what i want to make sure everybody understands is, that first aid business is getting back to that more reoccurring revenue stream with that cabinet service business, which we are very excited about and to think about 9% or high single-digit type of a growth rate for first aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of ppe. so still a strong performance.
and what i want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single-digit growth rate in '22 with ppe declining, that cabinet service business is growing very strongly. and what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the first aid business in fiscal '22. and we probably won't get back all the way to pre-covid levels in terms of margins in first aid, because just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions or some momentum that has to build. but definitely the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from toni kaplan with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i know you talked about the margin guidance earlier in the call and addressed the inflation impacts. but i wanted to see if you could provide maybe some additional detail around which business lines you're expecting to see the most strength from a margin perspective?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, toni. i would say, you know, all of our -- we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well and in order for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going to need good performance out of all of our businesses and that translates into very good incremental margins, especially in our rental business. it certainly as paul just described, it means that we're going to see some nice improvement in our first aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. we expect continued good performance in our fire business as i think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. we've got some great momentum and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year. and then certainly our direct sale business, those margins, i would expect from a percentage standpoint to really increase nicely as we see those -- see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. so we're looking for margin -- good margin performance in all of our businesses, all contributing to that guidance range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
toni the -- obviously, we're guiding toward all of our businesses growing incremental margins 20%, 30%. but when you think about, obviously the mix is going to change in all those businesses and each of them sold with the exception of fire, there were some ppe and so there is -- we'll get back to more traditional type of mix and that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. and in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the 15 million to 20 million businesses that you don't currently service. could you just talk about the recent industry outsourcing trends, has that -- have you seen that accelerate or flat? and can you -- how do you go about reaching out to those businesses? is that an initiative, a big opportunity for you any more so than historically? just how should we think about the opportunity?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, toni, the outsourcing trends continue, that has been positive. in addition, the focus on bringing manufacturing back to the united states and canada, we think it will be a positive, just that's obviously in the early innings. but both of those we think will be positives for our business. as far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure and part of that infrastructure is in our route based and part of that is in our sales organization. so that is a significant investment. you've probably also seen, i hope, you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're leveraging, because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. and the number one thing we hear from customers and prospects frankly is, hey, i didn't know you did that. that is a product or service that they didn't realize that we provided. so we're trying to leverage that and get the message out and to give low air cover to our infrastructure.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tim mulrooney with william blair. please go ahead.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
good morning, guys. i wanted to check in on the healthcare opportunity, which i know has gotten a lot of attention on recent calls. we haven't talked about it a lot yet today. you previously stated that i think the vertical could expand from kind of 7% of sales today toward potentially 10% of sales over the next several years, but i know things are changing rapidly these days. so with another three months under your belt, i'm curious of those expectations have changed at all in either direction?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
tim, this is todd. i'll start. we don't see momentum slowing down in that area. again hospitals are getting back to more normal operations. how they run their business and our value proposition resonates with them. we've talked often about the various products and services that we provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a healthy environment. so there is a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now. obviously in healthcare business, because of what they do for a living, there has always been a major focus on providing an environment that allowed for high patient satisfaction, that was not only in health, but also in image. so it's a -- when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us in the products and services we provide and there is a long runway there. we're providing products and services to health institutions that, i'd like to think, you'd be impressed by the name of -- there were some people we do business with. so who is who in that business. but nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated where we can be, should be and will be. so we're very much in early innings on that vertical still.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, todd. and just switching gears, i apologize if you already addressed this, but how did the energy cost impact the results this quarter? i don't know maybe year-over-year sequentially or however you want to present it, but can you also talk about your expectation for energy cost that's built into your guidance, maybe for your fleet, but then also for your production plans? thank you.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
tim our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue, that's up 30 basis points from the third quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. so we did certainly see some increase within the quarter. our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe even a little bit higher. so that's what we've got incorporated, most of that increase being price at the pump. so our gas and our service, our routes. so that's we got in the guidance.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america securities. please go ahead.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
hi guys, good morning. i guess on revenue. first, one clarification, one question. i just wanted to clarify. so high single-digit for first aid, i heard that and then i heard some discussion of the tough comps and i think the term bumpiness. is high single-digit, the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question. is that a fair statement on that business? and the question then on revenue. on the rentals business right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. you've got easy comps, you've had sequential improvement throughout last year. the fourth quarter had quite strong growth. i guess i wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. is -- did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from pp&e that rolls off, and is that a drag or are there other factors beyond just your normal conservatism that might be weighing on that business? thank you.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
so, gary, as far as the first aid, yes, think about it is high single-digits for the year. as mike stated, q4 last year q1, excuse me, q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the first aid business as was q1. so the comp from -- right now, were really big. so as the year goes on, the ppe will -- comp will lessen, and as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. so the bumpiness that mike spoke about is simply the ppe comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. as far as the rental, yes, as we mentioned the math there is ppe in that in our results from last year in rental as well. and again, just going back to our total guidance, if the ppe would repeat that we do not believe that it will this year then you'll be into the -- the number which is over than 8 [phonetic] as far as internal growth. so how far into the edge [phonetic] i really don't know, but nevertheless, we will be picking up heck of on a basis points in growth if that ppe repeated. so it's a headwind.
we're proud that we provided the product to our customers. our customers really valued it. it open doors -- upon but kept their doors opened in many cases and our net promoter scores reflect it. so they were very appreciative that we were able to provide those products and services. if they need them again, we'll provide them. we just don't think that there'll be at the levels that they were in the past.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thank you. and then the quick follow-up. in the past, mike, i think you've provided the breakdown of the rentals business revenue in the fourth quarter by the various sub segments. i wonder if you'd be willing to do that again this year?
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
yes, gary, it's paul. we do. yes, gary, we have that information for you. excuse me. and i would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is q4 sample. q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. obviously there is a lot of noise in these figures, excuse me, and that it's an unprecedented time, fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. so a lot of job losses, lot of pandemic driven demand as todd just said for certain items of ppe. so wanted to throw that out there first, but last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 q4, uniform rental was 50% of the segment mix dust, which is the walk off mats, mops that was 18% of the mix, hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, etc, that's 14% last year, shop towels were 4%, linens 10% and the catalog business which is more like the direct -- small direct sale components of the rental business products off of the route from the drivers that was 4%. so then this year's mix, uniform rental 48%, dust 17%, hygiene 17%, shop towels 4%, linens 9% and catalog 5%.
so again, obviously covid impacted results not necessarily reflective of future performance. but with the -- this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed, typically like in the q4 of fiscal '20 that was mostly restroom type items, soaps and air fresheners, the paper, but in this q4 '21 that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing sprays etc, and then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5% and that's where a lot of the ppe in the uniform rental and facility services business that we've talked about is recorded. the masks gloves, those types of items.

scott, i'll say, each of our businesses were acquisitive. but tuck-ins, certainly some geographic expansion as well. so we're highly active and there is folks that are at least answering phones and taking calls and we'll see where that goes. certainly you wonder about changes to tax -- potential changes to taxes, will that free things up, it will be interesting to see what happens with that. as far as the size and multiples, such a things, there is everything from the very small to medium sized types, i will comment on else but it's -- they're all active and part of it is because multiples, if you look at historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high and -- but we're quite active in that area because, we look at it from the very long-term approach and we know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. those -- because of our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table, that in many cases, the folks that we're speaking to don't have that broadness. it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross-selling it across each of our enterprise.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great, thanks, i appreciate that. and then my follow-up is a bit of a two-part, but it ties together pretty well. and todd sectioned in the press release mention of investment -- continued investment in technology, competitive advantage. just hoping you could elaborate on that. and then the back part of the question is, capex was down a lot in the past fiscal year, almost half of what it was in the fiscal year '19 and down a good bit from fiscal '20. just curious where that goes this year and maybe any tie together with the question? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
great. i'll start with the tech question and then mike can handle the capex if he prefers. scott we're investing heavily there, because we see a need to primarily -- whether it's productivity or from a competitive advantage, all areas of our business, we talked about leveraging sap, leveraging the platforms that come along with that, that they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us and then obviously the data that goes along with that. but that being said, we see some opportunities in automation that we've been investing in over the years and we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of our fleet that we're investing in, that we think can pay big dividends in that area. and so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with cintas. so -- and we think as you do that, that provides leverage for us. so leverage in the marketplace. so, michael. i'll let you handle the capex question.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. from a capex perspective, clearly the amounts were down in this past year, because capacity needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. we certainly kept up the capex for maintenance activities, but as we -- there is a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when this revenue starts to -- has started to come back and we've seen some momentum, but there will be a little bit of a lag in the capex. having said that, i expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. that puts us probably in the $250 million range for fiscal '22. but certainly when we invest, we will certainly -- when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do that.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
the great news is regarding our investment in the erp system sap that we've talked about a lot. i mean a lot of that -- the spending in that some of the major expenses behind us and it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network in that sap. we had the g&k acquisition that added more locations and have slowed down the time to complete it. then we had the pandemic. and so the exciting thing is, the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business. of course, still in technology, but a lot of it's already paid for, and now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy so to speak out of the box and not just using it for the access and those of running the business, but using it to be that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and our final question today comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. please go ahead.
brian -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey guys, this is actually brian on for kevin. thanks for squeezing us in here. thanks for the commentary, kind of around the color sort of on the reopening and you don't expect, not all customers are quite back yet. so just drilling in that a little bit. how should we think about, sort of what percentage of clients are still inactive versus maybe kind of how that compares to out of businesses or attrition that we would see? just to kind of frame that in and any sort of commentary around how that shakes out geographically, either geographically or by vertical here in the us?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
so, brian. i don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, i'd say most businesses are back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. we mentioned canada, specifically is an outlier which we expect, let's just say by august, september to be back much closer to normal. but one of the big issues is, there are 7 million people less working today than they were a year ago or so. and of those 7 million people, i don't know what -- how many of them are cintas-ers or will be, but there is a percentage and we want those -- may see those folks get back to work and whether they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our first aid products and services, all that impacts us. so the -- for the most part, businesses are back. there is certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over time.
brian -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it, ok. and then last one here for us. you guys talked about continuing to expand on esg reporting and certainly what we've noticed is the esg scores tend to focus on the internal operations, but we'd be curious if you could just touch on maybe how you guys help your customers achieve their esg goals? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, brian, great question. our heritage, what we do and frankly something in the rental business, what our industry does, the impact it has on saving customers water, energy, what we do to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer, because those products whether they're garments or towels or what have you all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or purchased and cleaned at home. and in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill or excuse me, save water, energy and the cleanliness of water as well. and i don't think we told the story well enough in the past, because at our heritage, we are a wash and reuse business. and again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units of energy and etc that will utilize because they're going to be either thrown at the landfill or laundered somehow, and we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than they would be at home or in another type of setting.
scott d. farmer -- executive chairman
i might add also that when you think about our first aid and safety and fire businesses, the purpose of those businesses are to keep our customers, employees, safe and healthy. and so it's a little bit of a different esg angle than what todd was talking about. but from an employee perspective, our goals are to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. so we're looking out for them from that s perspective of the efsg as well.
operator
thank you. and this concludes today's question-and-answer session. mr. adler, at this time, i'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
all right, thanks, nick. and thank you all for joining us this morning. we will issue our first quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in september, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. have a good day.

operator
good day, everyone and welcome to the cintas first quarter fy '21 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to mr. paul adler, vice president and [phonetic] treasurer, investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
paul f. adler -- vice president, treasurer and investor relations
thanks, shelby. thank you for joining us. with me is todd schneider, president and chief executive officer; and mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
we will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2022. after our commentary, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the sec.
i'll now turn the call over to todd.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. first quarter, total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or eps grew 11.9%. every business whether goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. every business has a need cintas can fulfill to help get them ready for the workday.
our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion compared to $1.39 billion last year. organic revenue growth was 8.2%. we expected solid growth over year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state. we also made solid progress on a sequential basis and in total revenue grew stronger than anticipated. we continued to make measured investments to support our growth. labor market remains challenging.
us still hasn't recovered $5.3 million pre-pandemic charts. this represents an opportunity for us. most of our customers are open. however, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-covid. we are seeing inflationary signs including higher costs of freight, energy, wages and supplies. we continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. these include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, reduce efficiencies and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs.
our first aid and safety services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. first quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison and last year's first quarter in response to the covid-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment or ppe sales were surging, propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. at that time ppe comprise an outsized percentage of first aid and safety services revenue mix.
as discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of ppe has declined as covid case counts have fallen from peak levels. however, ppe remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-covid. over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. we welcome the shift in mix, because first aid cabinet service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. all other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. the fire business' organic revenue growth rate was 17.8% and the uniform direct sale business growth rate was 68%. both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced covid case counts.
regarding our balance sheet and cash flow our financial position remains strong. recently, on september 15 we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. the amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 cents represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. we continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. i'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. they continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers.
the covid-19 pandemic continues of course fueled recently by the surge of the delta variant. we remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially lifesaving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically clean garments such as healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services.
now before turning the call over to mike i want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. we view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension, also as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social and governance report. we are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability.
i will now turn the call over to mike.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, todd and good morning. our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. the organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter.
gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for uniform rental and facility services, 44.8% for first aid and safety services, 46.1% for fire protection services, and 41.5% for the uniform direct sale.
selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. this increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as a slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our uniform direct sale business. operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%, operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21.
our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. diluted eps was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. we are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. we are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion. and diluted eps from a range of $10.35 to $10.75 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90.
please note the following regarding our guidance. fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. the higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted eps guidance by about $0.77 and diluted eps growth by about 760 basis points. the guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surge in covid-19 delta variant. however, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks, such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns.
finally when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results. in last fiscal year's second quarter certain uniform rental and facility services operating assets were sold. the pre-tax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second-quarter operating margin by 100 basis points.
the pre-tax gain and the related tax benefit impacted eps by $0.25. and in last -- in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in covid-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. we provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other.
that concludes our prepared remarks. now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from tim mulrooney with william blair.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. good morning. thanks for taking my question. can you talk about the primary factors that led you to raise revenue guidance this quarter? was it primarily related to the better than expected result that you generated here in the first quarter? or is it more related to your outlook for the remaining three quarters of this fiscal year?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
hey, tim, it's todd. thanks for the question. well, certainly our performance in q1 exceeded our expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. we like the new business that as a driver of growth for us, and we're providing more products and services to our customers. so those who are open and hopefully they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. but in general, yeah, we like -- like the momentum that we see in our businesses.
tim mulrooney -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thanks, todd. i was wondering if you could also maybe talk about growth by vertical, a little bit more this quarter. i know hospitality was showing a strong recovery last quarter. did that vertical stall out a little bit as covid cases ramped up here in august and september? and are there any other end markets that you'd call out here as being somewhat stronger or weaker than you had expected?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
well, great question, tim. certainly the hospitality business is well, so far down. hospitality was that it's coming back and is coming back nicely. i wouldn't use the word stalled out by any stretch. certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. so, orders aren't received and shipped in real time meaning that they make those decisions about staffing, there is a process, we can place the orders, we ship them etc. so there's a little bit of a tail there, but we still like what we see in the hospitality business. certainly they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically.
but in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better and but they would have been anxious right about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. as far as our other areas, healthcare continues to do well for us. we've talked about those offerings that we have and they really resonate with those folks. so whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, etc., all that is very attractive for folks. and i'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets in many cases is disposables. and with the focus on esg, their value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. it's very attractive for the healthcare institutions and many institutions to say while you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use, so again that value proposition is very much resonating.
operator
we'll take our next question from andrew wittmann with r.w. baird.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, thanks. i don't usually ask about the direct sales segment, but i'm going to this quarter. the segment margins in all other came out very strong. we haven't seen them this strong in a while obviously plus 68%. it's a big number, but we all know that the compare was fairly easy. todd, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the margin leverage, was there an unusually large order that came back with somebody kind of redressing folks or maybe just a little bit of color as to what drove the great profit margins in the all other reportable segment?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
well andy, first off, thanks for the question. our partners in that area of the business really appreciate. you're calling it out and signing that their performance is really, really good. you're right, the comps are more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business in particular last summer, but our revenues coming back very nicely there, hence the revenue growth, and we're getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place and mike cited that we had a sale of an asset that occurred in that area.
so, but in total, you put it all together we see, you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the future. but nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there and we think we're well positioned, our organization is -- was as you can imagine right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer and we think we're in a really good spot and to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on our investment.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well the other half or part of that all other segment is the fire business, which also had a great first quarter. and so we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. we saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the fire business and had organic growth of 17.8%. we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah. okay. and then i guess just from my follow-up question i wanted to just get a little bit more specific on the labor markets both as it relates to your own business, your ability to hire and compensate people as well as the impact on your customers. i don't know if there's a way for you guys to talk to us about the level of staffing at your -- you're always following new business, but historical customers that you've had through this whole time, what is the headcount look like for those customers? are they still, can you quantify how far down they are, i mean, we talked about the 5 million jobs that are still missing. how many of those were former cintas wearers?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, andy, first off, you can't open up a newspaper where you are hearing about wages and pressure in the market on labor. so we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. and so we are battling at every single day and staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business. and as far as our customers, i mean, it's really difficult to say, to put a number on it. it varies so much based upon geographies and industries, the restaurant businesses is certainly, they're nowhere near back to where i think they hopefully will be someday, and certainly not back to where they were pre-covid as an example. warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-covid levels.
in total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels and i think we're representative of the 5 point something million jobs that we have less in us versus pre-covid. so we're anxious for our customers to get back to previous levels, and when we think about labor, and we think about those functions we always focus more about how it effects our customers. we'll figure things out and how to manage it.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
not only 5.3 million jobs lost right versus pre-pandemic but still 10 million or 11 million job openings that have been filled which is a great opportunity for us.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the latest number i saw from the bureau of labor statistics that reported out earlier this month was 10.9 million job openings. so i don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, etc., but we'd like to see those all be filled.
operator
we'll take our next question from manav patnaik with barclays capital.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
thank you. good morning, gents. i just had one question for you guys. and i was just hoping you talked about wage and labor. can you just talk about the moving pieces on the cost side, we've heard a lot about driver shortages and fuel costs and supply chain, i was just hoping you guys could just give us a quick in a state of what's happening with you guys?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
so, manav, i'll start and then mike can assist with this. certainly, energy costs are increasing. we're seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities, but we worked really hard on efficiencies in routing and our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. and i think we're doing a very good job there. wages, we talked a little bit about, but we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years.
so we weren't flat-footed when it came into this wage subject. we're continuing to address it. we've got to be very competitive in the market place to attract the rate partners on our team and we're doing that and we got to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. and then as you can imagine, we've been very diligent about managing discretionary spend. there is some travel that is back, but certainly not near the levels that they were pre-covid. mike, anything else?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think that hits the cost side, but manav also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in july, but we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. it's a strategic local customer by customer review, but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base and certainly, that's important as we look at things like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year. we're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we always thought that we're managing them very, very diligently. we're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities, and if we need to, we can strategically increase prices and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few years off.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. and actually maybe if i can squeeze in one more, just hoping you could give us an update on the m&a pipeline, perhaps in the non-uniform businesses like other opportunities that you guys are actively seeking?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
great question, manav. we are active and acquisitive in every business we're in. we'll say that activity has ramped up here in the back half of the year probably in anticipation of tax changes, etc. but nevertheless, so, we like activity, we have -- we are in a great financial position, we love our balance sheet. and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations our number 2 use of capital is for m&a. and so we're very acquisitive and looking very active and looking forward to closing on more deals in the near future.
operator
we'll take our next question from hamzah mazari with jefferies.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. thank you. i just wanted to follow up on pricing, you had mentioned you hadn't taken pricing for a while i think maybe two years or 18 months or whatever. and i think you just referenced you're beginning to take price now, what kind of price is baked into your guidance? and how are the customer conversations? i assume customers see inflation headlines all over the place. so, and given you have an increased pricing for a while. could you maybe talk about order of magnitude, are you doing that pricing catch up or how should we think about pricing strategy?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
hamzah, i wouldn't think of it as a catch-up and we have not raised prices in two years. but these are mike mentioned. these are strategic decisions, their pricing is a local subject. it really gets down to what type of -- what the industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition is their business and to be able to handle it. so that we are able to be fair with our customers as we look out, meaning that there are certain organizations that their business is doing a whole lot better than others and we're conscious of that.
but as far as the conversations again, that would depend upon the particular business, but it does there -- it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. so that certainly gives us a little benefit. but these conversations are -- they're never easy, right, because from our customer standpoint. it's a tough subject. and we're focused on the long term value of those customer relationships and we handle them appropriately.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got it, got it. and just my follow-up question would just be around just, i know -- i know it's been a while since the sap implementation was completed, but then covid hit and we were sort of caught up in that, and it's still kind of going on, but maybe you could just give some examples on how the sap system is maybe benefiting you now as organic growth comes back. maybe if you want to talk about it qualitatively or quantitatively, however, either on the cost side or revenue side, any examples would kind of be helpful?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, hamzah. so a few items on sap that what we're benefiting from, certainly one view of the customer is significant for us and that helps us with cross-sell and we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services. the customer sees more value and when they see more value -- it's a better retention tool for us. so that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. we get some other, some advantage from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects.
but some other items i think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. we are focused on that from a $1 efficiency, from our ambition on the 2050 net-zero emissions, and we see we can advance that subject, advance the ball much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. so that will be exciting.
the other item is with sap allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. and what we realize is that our customers want -- they don't want to communicate with us the way that they did when i started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. they do want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us.
and our online presence and we call it mycintas, allows for our customers to do just that. so providing more value to more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine to five type model. so those are significant for us. another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer, receive an order from a customer, to when we can get it up to them. having that transparency throughout our supply chain is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better and even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically, and so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and able to get them products and faster than that we had in the past. so we want to leverage that system. and i think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more to come.
operator
we'll take our next question from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. revenue growth in the quarter was stronger than you expected on a sequential basis. can you elaborate on the sources of upside specifically in where you see the most promising trends over the next year?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
george, i'll start, but i'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. it's still quite robust. our value proposition is resonating very much and many companies are still struggling with staffing as we cited earlier 10.9 million jobs -- job openings. when you struggled with staffing and you can find a company like cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. so they look at and say what you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the past. so that resonates with them, so that's been quite nice.
most of -- moving on to another driver -- most of our customers were i'd say are open and probably were open going into the first quarter, but we are providing more products and services to them. we are again anxious for them to get back to their pre-employment levels and we think that will be even better. but new business and then i'd say again adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful color and then wanted to dive into pricing increases which you touched on earlier. to what extent do you think that pricing combined with efficiencies can fully offset the input cost increases that you're seeing, and could there be a timing lag as to when those pricing increases will take effect and the real time nature of the input cost increases that we're seeing now.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, george, certainly timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and when we see changes in the supply chain for example, but we're doing our best to manage and as i mentioned a little bit ago when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that, look, there are increases in cost and these price increases when we do make them they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers, that's been our experience so far.
the really nice thing about our, if you think about our cost structure as well. todd, hit on this a little bit that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. and so we may not be while not immune we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others and so that's important for us. the other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. so when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. and so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us.
and in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. so generally speaking, we feel like we're, while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works.

we'll take our next question from ashish sabadra with rbc.
ashish sabadra -- rbc capital market -- analyst
thanks for taking my question and good results. mike, i just wanted to drill down further on the cross-sell opportunities that you mentioned. i was wondering if you could provide any color on where you are in penetrating let's say hygiene products, safety, as well as first aid and fire services within your existing customer base and how can you accelerate that cross-sell either through organic or through m&a? any color on those fronts? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
ashish, well, thanks for the comments and the questions. we have our sales and service organization well positioned to offer these various products and services. again we -- they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. they're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to customers. and as i mentioned, the more value -- excuse me -- the more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that relationship will be just like most relationship, right, if it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth.
so it's very much a point of focus. when you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs our fire service, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. but we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers, who will need some direct sale, there are uniform rental and we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products training, cpr all of the various items that we provide.
so it's -- our biggest issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided and that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. and we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organizations, but also to our mass media spend, which may have seen this past weekend, where we have a significant position on in golf's ryder cup where we're trying to get the message out about all the service -- products and services we provide and they're not a complete one-stop shop for our business, but we should do get them a long ways on that path. mike, anything else on that.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, the only thing i would add is, the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. and so when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental items such as our restroom products and our things that we talked about recently in the last year like isolation gowns and hand sanitizers we're in a very early innings. and when you couple that with the first aid and safety and fire opportunities again less than 20% penetration. and so we've got a lot of work to do and the really exciting thing is much opportunity remains.
ashish sabadra -- rbc capital market -- analyst
that's very helpful color. that's great. and maybe just a quick clarifying question. i was just wondering at a very high level, can you provide what are the key categories of spend and the percentage of expenses from labor versus field versus amortization of equipment? any color will be helpful. thanks.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. well, let me start with energy. so energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of our -- of our laundry operations in the quarter was 2.1%. that is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. so while it is up, some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure.
when you think ashish about our cost structure though, you can, i'm going to use cost of rentals. you can think about them in three buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries, and then the cost of the service component. and while they're not exactly the same that you can think about them as a third each and each of those buckets are a little bit different. i mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time.
so we did a little bit of smoothing of those costs and then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. the major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. when you think about the laundries then your -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly the equipment that's in our wash-alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. and then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks, and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those.
when you put it all together, certainly labor is a large part of our cost structure, the materials, the products that we sell. certainly, a large part of our structure and we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities.
operator
we'll take our next question from toni kaplan with morgan stanley.
jeff -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is actually jeff [phonetic] on for toni. i know this question was asked earlier related to revenue guidance, but i wanted to ask it slightly different as it relates to eps. the eps guide is up by about 2% for the full year, but it seems like a lot of that is maybe flowing through the buybacks and a better-than-expected tax rate. so, is that fair and is that to say from an operating standpoint, maybe a little bit more optimistic on the revenue side, but maybe some cost headwinds keep you a little conservative here. just some more color on that would be helpful.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
sure, jeff. i don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. you think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90, that's 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual eps, but you referred to a lower tax rate. our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. so that's quite a significant impact and if you think about the 760 basis points that i referred to in my opening remarks, that takes eps growth from about 11% to 14%
now, certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pre-tax earnings growth in the range of double digits. and so it's a pretty good year. and then if you kind of move further up, we talked in july about our guidance of implying operating improvement at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 basis points at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today.
and keep in mind that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. so to kind of say that our guidance is based on share buyback and taxes, i think is not a great reflection of really what's going on. the guidance on the eps side is nice healthy margin improvement. pre-tax increases of right around the double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that eps down. hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that eps guidance.
jeff -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. that was helpful. and then i want to ask about first aid margins which were pretty strong in the quarter. are you able to quantify at all, how much ppe is still constraining the margins there. just given it's greater than normal mix. and then i guess based on that, how should we think about near term upside as that rolls off? like, is that really going to kick up in the next few quarters as that roll off? just kind of overall, if you could talk about the path back to pre-covid level margins in that line of business. thanks.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. we certainly -- ppe has been a major factor in that business and jeff, you're correct in pointing that out and it was -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. but we've seen some nice sequential improvement there, 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of call it 48-ish% and so we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels.
so now the ppe that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the first aid comes back because as todd and paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit, fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. and so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets and that creates some nice momentum.
that's one of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers. so prospects turning into customers are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy. and our first aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. and so, our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space now, but it's coming back and while we like the momentum we're not there yet and we do expect to see sequential improvement and i'll maybe step that back of it. we expect to see improvement in the year. every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there, but generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business.
operator
we'll take our next question from gary bisbee with bank of america securities.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. if i could go back to labor for a minute, i think a lot of your comments have been about cost than working on wages. but are you fully staffed, both from a service and a sales perspective. and if you had seen any elevated turnover relative to history or had any increased difficulty hiring to support the rebound in growth you're seeing.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
gary, very good question. i guess the way i describe it is, we're happy to run at higher rpms to get the output that we want. so, it's harder, there's no doubt about it. attracting, retaining and developing the talent is core to what we do as a company and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels that we want to be at. so are we staffed with the levels we want to be at? yeah, we like our staffing position, turnover is still very manageable. and i think it speaks to many, many things, certainly the total compensation that we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put into people, because there are so many partners that have grown up in the company and have -- and have advanced in the company, and that's part of our culture. so we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for people about, this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you, and we are having to work harder at it, but it's still resonating with folks. and so that's where we are now.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
okay, great. and then on, you've talked about the ppe and some of the pandemic-driven sales in first aid and safety. but i think you also had some of that in uniforms, handling that stuff through the facilities business is i'm not going to ask you when it's going to go away because who knows, but is there a meaningful chunk of revenue there that probably churns off in the future and what i'm really trying to think through is how that could impact the rate of growth over the next several quarters or whatever in the core uniforms business? is it elevated or is that just not a big deal in the grand scheme of that business?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, gary what mike spoke of, it's a significant portion of our first aid and safety business. there was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business, sold on route and that was for ppe, but nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our first aid business. so is there some there today. there is a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever.
so, and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot, if the demand is there for those types of products and services. we're managing that inventory, and there is still demand. we sure hope as a country and as north america as a world that -- that is -- that will be diminishing over the course of the balance of our fiscal year.
so our guide takes all that into account and we're focused on building the core of our business. and but if our customers need those types of products and services we are there for them and we will help them with this.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
gary, i might just add, as you're thinking about, i believe you referred to the next several quarters. as i've said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter and so that's going to be as you think about the growth. so quarter-to-quarter definitely keep that in mind as third quarter growth impact.
now, again, as it relates to this ppe, you know, look the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating and we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-covid and that certainly is exciting for us.
operator
we'll take our next question from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning, all. i want to hone in a little bit on the offsetting efficiencies of the environment in the automation. just anecdotally if you could speak to a few things you're doing, i know in hamzah's question, you talked about sap and automation of payments and customer facing, just curious if you could elaborate, maybe a little bit on what you're doing in this environment may be facilities or otherwise and some of the longer term goals of other automation? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, scott. a couple of obvious ones for us i mentioned routing that is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. the -- scott farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks. right. we generate revenue when the wheels stop. and we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so and we're excited about the impact that will have only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward.
in the production facilities we are managing very tightly, our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantities that went through pre-covid on the same playing field meaning same amount of volume that's going through. and we put some technology in place to help us with that. instead of just doing it through elbow grease. and as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there and again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our mission and so we're focused on making sure that -- that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, one other one i might talk about, i don't know that todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. and when we are more efficient in our stock rooms. so let me be clear, our stock rooms are within all of our rental facilities, they are garments that have been in service already and so when we are efficient that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure and so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully.
and so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. sap has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stock room. so that's another example scott of something that's really benefiting us.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
excellent. sounds good, guys. thanks. i appreciate that. and then just, just as a follow-up. wanted to touch on, it sounds like you're very active in m&a that came up, i think particularly before calendar year end maybe with some consideration for tax implications. but you've done over $1 billion worth of stock buybacks in the fourth and the first quarter here, back to back. and that's just kind of looking back that's big if any year going back for a while. so i'm just kind of curious how the thought process there is, it sounds like you're getting close on some m&a, but it's not really a lot of allocation of capital is going to repurchase, is that something we should expect to continue?
todd m. schneider -- president and chief executive officer
scott, we are, as i mentioned, we're active and it takes two to dance and we're singing more folks at the dance as anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform and as a result we think more deals will come through. now that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet and we are ready, willing and able to activate their balance sheet as appropriate. that is best for long term value for our organization. and just as a reminder, the number 1 priority for our capital has been and will continue to be the investment into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our number 1 priority.
and then after that, number 2 is m&a, and we are steadfast in that commitment and we will allocate appropriately. and then thereafter, then we'll return to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and dividends. and i think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately intelligently for the long term value.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the cintas second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release conference call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. paul adler, vice president and treasurer, investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
paul f. adler -- vice president-treasurer & investor relations
thank you, madison. thank you for joining us. with me is todd schneider, president and chief executive officer; and mike hansen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. we will discuss our fiscal 2022 second quarter results. after our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.
the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the securities and exchange commission.
i'll now turn the call over to todd.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, paul. our second quarter financial results were led by our strong revenue increase of 9.4%. our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. i think our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers.
the benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. excluding last year's $18 million pre-tax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and uniform rental and facility services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year and eps grew 16.5%. these results are especially significant given that they were achieved in a period in which u.s. inflation hit a 39-year high.
uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. organic revenue growth was 8.5%. the labor market is challenging. however, we are benefiting in the current environment. businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent covid infections. businesses are increasingly outsourcing to cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be ready for the workday.
and it is noteworthy that the u.s. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings total about 11 million. return of jobs represents future revenue growth opportunity for cintas.
our first aid and safety services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. organic revenue growth was 3.2%. second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. last year's second quarter, in response to the covid-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment or ppe were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. at that time, ppe comprised an outsized percentage of first aid and safety services revenue mix. the amount of ppe has declined year-over-year, as expected. however, covid infections are still prevalent and ppe remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-covid.
over the same period of time, recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. in fact, it is up 20% from last year. we welcome this shift in mix because first aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than ppe.
our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. all other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. the fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9% and the uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 47.3%. both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment.
regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year, and free cash flow improved 16%. recently, on december 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. the amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. we continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return.
before turning the call over to mike, i want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social and governance report. cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. we are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability. the report, our second consecutive, provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption and scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. our esg report further illustrates that our corporate culture, based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve, is a competitive advantage.
i'll now turn the call over to mike.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, todd, and good morning. our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. the organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9.3%. gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year.
gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for uniform rental and facility services, 43.5% for first aid and safety services, 44.6% for fire protection services, and 39.1% for uniform direct sale. energy related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. also we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth.
selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year. operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points.
our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. in addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets.
net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million compared to $284.9 million last year. diluted eps was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted eps by $0.25, this year's second quarter diluted eps of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%.
we are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. we are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted eps from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95.
please note the following regarding our guidance. fiscal;22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. the higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted eps guidance by about $0.72 and diluted eps growth by about 700 basis points. guidance does not include any future share buybacks and guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by covid-19. however, guidance does not contemplate significant covid-19 pandemic related setbacks, such as stay-at-home orders or cost necessary to comply with government covid-19 mandates.
finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in covid-19 cases by providing them with a very large supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves in particular. we provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. excluding the ppe that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9%, at the top end of our range.
that concludes our prepared remarks. now, we are happy to answer questions from analysts. please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. thank you.

[operator instructions] we'll go ahead and take our first question from manav patnaik with barclays. please go ahead.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
thank you very much. i was hoping you could just address kind of your -- in the near-term visibility, more in terms of reactions from your customers with the spread of omicron, and if you're seeing any change of behaviors, or are people just kind of chugging along here?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
hey, manav, this is todd. thanks for your question and good morning. at this point, we haven't seen a change in our customer base as a result of omicron. it's a little early to tell, certainly. but nevertheless, i would say it's business as usual at this point with our customers and we're looking forward to the back half of the year.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then maybe just as a follow-up just tied to the other pressures out there, which is inflation. it sounds like you guys are handling that well. you referred to investments in the labor force. can you just address what that is and broadly, how you feel about managing these inflationary pressures going forward as well?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, great question. inflation is certainly real. but i think we're managing it quite well. we do have a world-class supply chain organization. that is a real competitive advantage in these cases. and fortunately, we've been addressing wages over the past couple of years as we've spoken about in past calls. so we weren't caught flat-footed as it relates to wages and, certainly, our wage increases are still a little above historical. but we are more investing in the infrastructure to be able to service our customers, so that based upon our current growth and our anticipated growth, which is we're very excited about.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
all right. thank you.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
all right. we'll go ahead and take our next question from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, it's andrew. if i try to back into the second half operating margins in the full year guide, i get to 19.1%, which is up modestly year-over-year. and i just wanted to make sure that you do the math the same way as me, maybe you could -- you kind of go through some of those kind of puts and takes in the second half operating margins.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, andrew. we would say our implied operating margin guidance for the second half of the year is a little bit higher than what you stated at 19.1%. we think of it closer to the 19.5%. and look, we still expect some very nice operating margin growth for the year, even in the back half of the year, and even in an environment which is pretty challenging as i'm sure you're aware in terms of the inflationary pressures. but as todd mentioned, we're managing that inflation. we like the margin improvement and our expectation is we're going to see better than the 19.1% that you referred to.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
right. and the 19.5% is for the total company i assume. and i just wanted to maybe make a comment on increases on the customer side, the b2b increases, because you were at a hiatus now. you've kind of in process of increasing prices to customers and you -- how has that gone? are they understanding of the inflationary environment?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
i'll take that one, mike. thanks for the question, andrew. certainly on the pricing, one thing that's important to understand is that we don't simply sent out a letter increasing prices to all 1 million customers all at the same time. we address the issue throughout the year. so you'll continue to see that. and also as we said in the past, pricing, it's a local subject. some industries are still struggling, some are doing quite well. some geographies are still not back to pre-covid and others are nicely ahead of the curve.
now inflation is, it seems like it's in every headline and every time you turn on the news. and as a result, i'd say the conversations with our customers are generally going well and our results are little bit better than historical in that area as well. but as you know, we take a long-term approach and we focus on the lifetime value of our customers, which frankly is reflected in our nps scores being at all time highs.
now all that being said, in the face of inflation being at 39-year high, we are growing our operating income and incremental margins at very attractive rates and we're excited about that.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
right. and then just confirm, 19.5% was total company, right?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, that was total company against last year of just under 19%, so again, what we think to be pretty healthy margin improvement. and let's keep in mind, last year's margins were record margins and 310 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels. so we like where we're headed with this, with the margins in the back half of the year.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
well said. thank you very much.
operator
all right. we'll go ahead and take our next question from hamzah mazari with jefferies.
mario cortellacci -- mario cortellacci -- analyst
hi, this is, mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah. just my first question around run labor. maybe you can just update us just not on the labor inflation portion, but also on the labor availability in your business and kind of how you're managing through that. and then also, maybe you could tie that through to what your pricing strategy looks like regarding that, especially since you guys really haven't taken any price in the past two years, i believe it was?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, mario, this is todd. as far as labor availability, we're competing quite well out there. we pay very competitive wage and a very attractive benefits. and we think we're an employer of choice. and that's reflecting in our staffing levels, which we like. it's certainly more challenging this year than in the past, in general. but we're competing quite well, and we like that.
as far as how we look at the pricing, again, it's a -- you will see it throughout the year and it is something that we look at customer by customer and -- because as i mentioned, it's a local subject. and we do look at the long-term value of the customers, but we have -- we're doing better than historical. and the reason being is because it's -- there is a little bit of wind in the sales as far as customers are highly aware of what's going on with the inflation in general and wage pressures as well. but as a result, we think we're in a good spot. i'm very thankful that we have been addressing wage increases over the past few years, because it prevented us from being flat-footed coming in and being under real pressure.
mario cortellacci -- mario cortellacci -- analyst
great. thank you. and then just for my follow-up, could you just comment on the fire business and your strategy for getting into some of the top fire markets that you're not currently in? and do you intend to play in any other adjacencies within the fire business such as what api group or other larger players have done in that space.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, mario. as far as the fire business, we're continuing to build out our footprint. we have found that we very much like our model that we are providing the service levels to customers. and it's showing up very nicely in new business wins and retention. and you're seeing it in the growth. as far as adjacencies, we're always evaluating those. but we think there's incredible run rate in that business with the type of strategy we have today without even going into an adjacency, but we're certainly always evaluating those.
mario cortellacci -- mario cortellacci -- analyst
great. thank you very much and i hope you all have a great holiday.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you. you too.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. your gross margins contracted 80 bps year-over-year in the uniform rental segment. can you elaborate a bit on margin performance there and what your guidance implies for uniform segment gross margins?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
certainly, george. this is todd. i'll start and then mike can chime in. gross margin in general was up 40 basis points due to just energy alone. so that's obviously headwind. i think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year. so -- but as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing, along with the growth that we see coming. the revenue now, george, is a little different from last year. it's much closer to our revenue, our traditional revenue mix. and let me just give you an example, because i think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better.
with ppe last year, as -- and there was obviously significant demand for that and we are happy to help our customers with it. but in those cases and in many of the cases with that, they will simply drop ship to those customers. and when you drop ship those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work, right? it's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue etc. you think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets. it simply takes more work, right? however, we welcome this shift, as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. it's stickier business and long term, and has better margin. so we like it. we like that switch and we knew that that was coming, and we've been staffing forward and guiding for it.
all that said, as we know inflation is at a 39-year high, as i mentioned. energy is up 40 basis points, our investment in growth for today and the future. and if you exclude the one-time gain of our operating or onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong. so we're doing exactly what we had hoped and planned for, i guess would be the way i would describe it.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. your healthcare and hygiene businesses have seen a boost in demand with covid. can you talk about trends and the broader opportunity you're seeing in healthcare and hygiene?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
certainly healthcare, they're connected, right? but healthcare is a vertical, hygiene is subject to across all businesses. so as far as the healthcare vertical, we're continuing to see strong demand. we like what we're providing with scrubs, items to help customers clean patient rooms and other rooms, in addition to isolation gowns. so all of that is -- we continue to be very bullish about the healthcare vertical.
as far as hygiene, and i'll lump hygiene with sanitization, cleanliness, all of that -- health, health and safety, all of that is, we believe has been a sea change and something that is going to be wind at our sales, maybe forever, right, because you see the focus that people have on sanitizing, hygiene, health, safety. we can see that in certainly our uniform rental facility services segments, but also our first aid business. people are very focused on the health, safety and wellness of their people and of their customers, of their patients and of their guests. and as a result, that's good for us.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from ashish sabadra with rbc.
ashish sabadra -- rbc -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made on the healthcare, but just focus on the larger opportunities across the 3 verticals: healthcare, government and education vertical. i was wondering if you could comment on the pipelines for those larger opportunities. thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. ashish, the pipeline, it looks quite strong for all those verticals. we feel good. our sales organization is operating at a very high level, and we really like our new business wins in that area. our retention is very attractive. so you look at all that, you see our new business wins are very strong, our retention is very strong and we are excited for our customers to get back to full strength as well. and we think that bodes well for the future for us.
ashish sabadra -- rbc -- analyst
that's very helpful color. and maybe just talking about technology, on the last call you had talked about the benefits of sap implementation and more to come. i was wondering if you could talk about what you're doing on the technology front, on the automation front, provide some preview on what we could see over the next few -- next year, and how should that help offset some of the inflationary pressure? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. great, great question. so obviously, investing in technology is one of our top priorities, because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. those are things that we're trying to leverage.
i think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging our sap and partnering with a communications company, we have launched what we call smart truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. so what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops. and as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. when the wheels are moving, that's just expense. so we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology, to improve operational efficiencies.
we have, as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. what we're seeing is, contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. what they're interested in is doing business on their time. and what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of the requests are outside of normal business hours. so it's making it easier to do business with us. we allow them to make request and changes to their program. we allow them to pay their bills online. all of these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace, being easier to do business with and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with.
ashish sabadra -- rbc -- analyst
that's very helpful color. thank you and happy holidays.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
all right. we'll go ahead and take our next question from andy wittmann with baird.
andy wittmann -- baird -- analyst
hey. great. thanks for taking my question. i guess i just wanted to get a little subjective comments on the new guidance this quarter versus the guidance you gave last quarter. mike, it kind of looks like the biggest change in the eps side is just a little bit lower tax rate. on the revenue side, the quarterly -- the consensus guide quarterly, but it kind of feels like the fundamental outlook for the revenue and core operating margin performance of the business isn't materially changed. is that the right way of looking at it or did you see a change in the business fundamentals that you're factoring into the guidance, the new -- the updated guidance today?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andy, i think that's a fair assessment from the perspective of -- not a lot of change from what we had been talking about in the last quarter and that is growth, continuing to be pretty strong in the second half of the year, ex that big ppe number that we've talked about in the third quarter and a little bit in the fourth quarter, our growth would be in excess of 9% and roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year and that is, we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. if we did hit 19.5% that i talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60-basis point improvement in the back half of the year, that's coming on top of, i'll call it, gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. and you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a zero to 70 basis point improvement and the performance midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that as that initial guide. and so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. but generally speaking, your assessment is fair, andy, pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago.
andy wittmann -- baird -- analyst
yes. okay. thanks for going through that, mike. i guess my follow-up question then just, you've just talked now and previously in the call you talked about the margins and i think they speak for themselves. and you talked about price being a little bit above average. are there any other things that are driving the margin performance besides just price, and then the operating leverage in the business, other actions or other investments that you're making that are helping this margin performance? or is this kind of just the natural progression of price/cost as well as fixed cost leverage?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. andy, this is todd. good question. i think it's the normal operation of the business. we are always investing in various items that help our operational efficiencies, and i mentioned the smart truck technology that we think is going to be exciting for us. but i think it's just a general leverage that we're getting in the face of what is a still a very challenging operating environment. and we are, as mike said, coming off of a record 310 basis point improvement in margin. we're very excited about that and we're going to continue to take another step forward this year.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andy, i might throw it into a couple of different buckets as well, and a little bit of reiterating what todd and i've already talked about that, look, our growth is at pretty good levels. and when we grow at that those pretty good levels, we get some really nice leverage in the business and we're seeing that leverage as a benefit, productivity improvements. i mean, we've -- from our laundry facilities to our service and the routes -- the route improvements that todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. and so, productivity is very strong. efficiencies, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure and we'd rather not give up many of those. and so, while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly.
and maybe then the last bucket i'll throw out there is, we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. and so, margin improvement, i think we can throw it in those four buckets, and it's -- i would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors.
andy wittmann -- baird -- analyst
yes. great. thanks for the comprehensive answer, guys. happy holidays.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you too, andy.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from tim mulrooney with william blair.
sam nelson -- william blair -- analyst
hey. this is sam nelson [phonetic] filling in for tim. thanks for taking our questions here. wanted to hit on margins real quick, again. in the uniform rental segment, operating margin was down year-over-year, but still very strong relative to historical standards. is that kind of how we should think about this segment's margin structure from a long-term perspective, maybe down year-over-year because of higher cost inflation, but capable maintaining 2021 margins in a more normalized environment?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, a couple, couple of points that i might make. first of all, we talked a little bit about the gain on the sale of assets from a year ago. and so, if you take -- that was all recorded in sg&a within rental. if you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year, so a 90-basis point improvement. so some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement.
look, we have been in the rental business above 20% for the last six quarters. and our expectation is, we are going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some ups and downs periodically. but generally speaking -- look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment, and our expectation is, we'll stay above that 20% number.
sam nelson -- william blair -- analyst
excellent. thanks for the clarification there. maybe switching gears back to the ppe. early in the year, i think you expected a ppe headwind of about 1% in fiscal 2022. it sounds like maybe that expectation could be changing a bit. can you just update us on what you think the ppe headwind will be for fiscal '22 here?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think if you take a look at our guidance for example for the back half of the year, i believe at the high end of revenue growth to 7.4% over last year. so if you think about the comment we made of growth being 9%, we're talking about 160 basis points in the back half of the year. and so, you can think about 80 basis points for the full year. so i would say we're not far from where we talked about early on in the year, but certainly it's back-end loaded, a little bit more.
sam nelson -- william blair -- analyst
got you. thanks for the color there. thanks.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from toni kaplan with morgan stanley.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. wanted to ask an esg-related question. given the size of your fleet, a shift to electric vehicles, seems like it will be pretty meaningful. and so, i know in your esg report, you indicated that by january you expect to deploy 12 electric vehicles. and so just curious if this program has been initiated and if you could talk about how we should think about the potential of rolling out this to the entire fleet? thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. toni, this is todd. thank you for the question. so yes, we're excited about electrifying the fleet. we are right on schedule as far as what we plan for testing. we have a diverse fleet because of the various types of trucks we have, the rental trucks, the first eight trucks and the fire trucks as well. but we're working with some very large manufacturers at very high levels, and we are excited about the future as it relates to that.
we think that that is something that's important to our customers, and it's important to our partners, our employee partners and we think it will be very important to shareholders as well. so we believe that getting out ahead of this curve is important to us and we're committed to doing so. and in dealing with all the challenges that are associated with that, with the weight of the vehicles that we operate, the size of our fleet and also getting access to the supply, which is why we're working with a diverse group and at high levels, so that way we are in a good position as a organization.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's helpful. and one question i've been getting recently is around the ability for you to do large scale m&a and some skepticism around that. do you think that's valid? or because of the fragmented market, there is still potential for you to be able to do a large deal? and i'd also say it maybe seems a little harder for deals to get done right now or at least longer to get approved. so just wanted to hear your thoughts around large scale m&a. thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes. toni. so just as a reminder, m&a is our second priority capital use, right behind investing in our business. and we're excited about m&a of all shapes and sizes. we're blessed to have a market that is massive in size. meaning, if you think about how many people are wearing garments, wearing uniforms out in the marketplace, it is a significant market. and that's representative of our new business wins that we have. so about two-thirds of our -- of the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programmers. some people in different industry call them unvented. nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program. and when they walk out, we do. so a little bit more complicated than that, but that's the net-net.
that being said, that's simply the uniform market. our other markets are just vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. same way with the first aid business. and in the fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market, just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services. so yes, i think that we're in an incredibly good position and all of those, because of the market size.
that leads us to, we think we're interested in m&a in all of our businesses and are excited about the potential of m&a of small, medium and large, because we think the market is such that it is absolutely appropriate.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very helpful. happy holidays. thank you.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer

operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning. i'm curious, this is a question of your average customer in first aid. pre-pandemic, what would their cabinet look like? how much is it changed of the items with the content inside to what it looks like now to the level of detail you can speak to that? and then how has the pricing and margin profile changed of that cabinets? i assume better, but anything you can share on that and then i do have a quick follow-up after. thanks.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
okay. scott. this is todd. as far as our cabinet, we're constantly bringing out new products for our first aid cabinet. and that is an important component of that business. we have to offer other services in that business, whether it be aeds, training and compliance as well as eyewash stations, which are required by osha to be serviced appropriately. so all of that is -- we're seeing a return back to a focus on that with our customers, which is exciting to us.
as far as the cabinet itself, besides the new products that we have launched, it's pretty well a traditional type of situation. now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guests, patients, those types of things. and as a result, we think that's good for the first aid business. and as we've spoken about, the first aid cabinet business is more predictable, provides more value to the customer than a drop ship type of ppe and is more profitable. so i think as you see that trend of the health and safety continuing and as more people are back to work, then that's going to be very positive for that business.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i might add a couple of things. just reminding you, scott, that i think todd mentioned that first aid cabinet business is up 20% year-over-year in our second quarter. so we really do like the momentum of it. but we're not quite back to the mix of pre-pandemic, but we certainly like the movement toward that mix.
and when we think about the gross margin in this business, the material cost really has improved. what you're seeing in this particular quarter is that we're spending a little bit of that improvement on some of the labor investments that todd talked about in terms of building the service capacity, both for the current growth that we've had, but also for anticipated second half of the year growth. so really nice performance by our first aid and safety partners and the performance is improving just like we expected it to, and just like we want it to.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thanks. i appreciate all that color. and the follow-up is on the same subject. you guys are running below what were pre-pandemic peak first aid and safety margins. do you think within a matter of a year or two, you can get back to the higher level? and why or why not? thank you.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
yes, scott, this is todd. so we're very focused on that. we think that revenue mix will be very positive for us. and we also look at the -- as i mentioned, the win behind our sales and the focus on health and wellness of folks out in the marketplace is going to be positive. so as we continue to focus on that area, net revenue mix rebalances, then i think you're going to see a nice trend toward more traditional tech margins in that business.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. appreciate, guys. happy holidays.
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, scott. you too.
operator
and we'll take our next question from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking my questions. hey, todd, i wanted to ask you a little bit on the competitive environment. aramark has been trying to execute a turnaround for the last couple of years. i want to know, does that make a difference to you guys in the market at all? have you seen a change in terms of competitiveness or in terms that you guys have to be more competitive? or is the market so fragmented that a change like that wouldn't necessarily filter back to you guys?
todd m. schneider -- president & chief executive officer
shlomo, thanks for the question. it's a good question. the operating environment we're in, it's always competitive. nothing noteworthy though, i would say, in the change. our revenue retention rates are very strong. and as i mentioned, our new business wins are very strong as well. and they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. and i just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on, providing that value to the customers.
when we walk in, and i'll just give uniforms an example. when we walk in, one of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, i didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. so they're surprised. one of the other items that we hear is, we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. they might have 10 wearers. and that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. so we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. and there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now. so being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people.
and you think about how many people are working out in the marketplace and the fact that we can provide that service to tens of millions of more wearers, it's very exciting for the future. and so as a result of how we focus on it, it really -- those competitive pressures, we're more focused on retaining our customers, and we're more focused on growing the market and because it's just so massive.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. and then maybe this is one for mike. just kind of in the other segments, i know there's definitely volatility quarter-over-quarter in terms of the margins just comparing the operating margin this quarter versus the last couple of quarters. and is there something besides -- sequentially, obviously, it's a lower revenue, which make a difference in the margin going back a couple of quarters. could you just give us some of the puts and takes of what's impacting the operating margin?
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
shlomo, when you look at q2 compared to q1, keep in mind that we referred in the first quarter call to a gain on sale of some assets. so in that -- in the first quarter, there was a $12.1 million gain. so we had a little bit of an anomaly in that particular quarter.
i'd say this. the fire business has been performing very, very nicely. and we've seen organic growth this quarter of 16.9% and remains healthy. and some of the things that todd and i have talked about with the first aid businesses going on and the fire business, in that we are certainly seeing some great growth. and we're investing for both current -- for that current growth but also for anticipated growth. so we're seeing a little bit of the investment there.
and then as you know, shlomo, the uniform direct sale business can be quite bumpy. and so there's going to be more volatility from quarter-to-quarter in this business. but i'd say this as well, 11.7% for the all other segment is still a pretty good quarter on a 65-day workday quarter relative to pre-pandemic. so again, just like the other businesses, we like the momentum in these businesses and we like the performance.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
you see that extra day versus, say, 4q '21 is a bigger impact? just trying to get a little bit more detail. completely appreciate the volatility in the uniform direct business.
j. michael hansen -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the direct -- i would say that the day is more of an impact to the fire business than it is the uniform direct sale. the uniform direct sale tends to be bumpy based on -- could be a rollout of a new program. it's just timing of the sales within those current customer programs. that's the biggest volatility item within the uniform direct sale.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you.

"
2018-Q3,CTAS,,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to mr. mike hansen, senior vp of finance and chief financial officer.
please go ahead, sir.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
thank you. good evening, and thanks for joining us tonight. with me is paul adler, cintas' senior vice president and treasurer. we will discuss our third-quarter results for fiscal 2018.
after our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides us safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. this conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.
i refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the sec. in a moment, we're going to share with you our third-quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. there's a lot of noise in our results. so we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business.
before diving into the numbers, though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of g&k services deal. the past year has been quite transformative for cintas. our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from g&k, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. we remain as excited as ever about our future.
in early february, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a one-time cash payment. the timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since march 21 of 2017. as our chairman and ceo, scott farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed u.s. tax reform legislation is good for cintas, our shareholders, and our customers.
and, again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. moving on to our third-quarter results. our revenue for the third quarter, which ended february 28, was $1.589 billion, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. the organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%.
the organic revenue growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the first aid and safety services segment was 10%. reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compared to $192 million in last year's third quarter. however, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year over year. first, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the g&k services acquisition.
second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the one-time cash payment to cintas partners that i just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. excluding these two items, our third-quarter operating income was approximately $250 million, or 15.7% of revenue. this measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first two quarters of this fiscal year. keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the g&k deal, and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, sap.
these two items total 1.2% of revenue. reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. reported earnings per diluted share, or eps, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66, compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and eps results to prior year.
first, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third-quarter eps included a negative impact of $0.06 from g&k transaction and integration expenses. second, fiscal '18 third-quarter eps also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to cintas partners. lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to eps of $1.59 from the benefits of the new tax act. excluding these items to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6%, compared to 9.8% last year, and eps increased 22.3%.
note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the g&k deal and incremental depreciation and implementation costs of sap. these two items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue, or $0.12. in addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on two important long-term investments, g&k and sap. the integration of g&k remains on track.
we have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. also, 59% of g&k locations have been converted to the cintas operating system. this is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. the system conversions are very important, as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies.
these activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. regarding sap, significant advancement continued in our implementation, which remains on schedule. in our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. a total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned.
as i have previously detailed, we have several third-quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. we expect fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.645 billion. i want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: in our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of g&k.
for the first time, g&k's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. in the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing cintas legacy business and a significantly sized, acquired g&k business that historically grew slower than cintas and that will have declined year over year in the fourth quarter. we expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our first aid and safety segment after it acquired zee medical. with the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the g&k business, we expect the total uniform rental and facility services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019.
for our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect eps from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. guidance assumes a fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%. we anticipate healthy fourth-quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. note that while the eps guidance excludes any future g&k transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition.
we estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul adler -- vice president and treasurer
thank you, mike. first, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior-year third quarter. however, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. one less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. we have two reportable operating segments: uniform rental and facility services, and first aid and safety services. the remainder of our business is included in all other. all other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business.
first aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.284 billion, an increase of 30% compared to last year's third quarter.
excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter, compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. the reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin g&k business. the margin of the g&k business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered.
in addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. while the assimilation of the g&k business continues at a great pace -- mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed -- more work remains. the g&k gross margins will improve to cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. we are on track.
our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. this segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. on an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10%. this segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter, compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points.
the third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe, and ready for the workday. our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. the uniform direct sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account.
our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. all other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17% compared to last year's third quarter. the organic growth rate was 14.9%. all other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points.
all other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. while uniform direct sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales-growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of southwest airlines. large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year, as businesses typically rebrand only every three to five years or so.
the benefit from southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth-quarter revenue. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter, compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. please note that the one-time cash payment to cintas partners mike mentioned earlier was recorded in sg&a. excluding this one-time payment, this year's third quarter sg&a as a percentage of revenue was 28.4%, compared to 28.6% last year.
sg&a benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. on a year-to-date basis, sg&a, excluding the one-time payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. however, note that current-year sg&a is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the g&k acquisition and incremental sap depreciation and implementation costs. we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.
as mike stated earlier, our third-quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new u.s. tax legislation. the benefit of the tax act to the third-quarter eps was $1.59. our eps guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24%.
note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock-compensation expense realized each period. our cash and equivalents balance as of february 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter-end. free cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million, or 75%, from the prior-year period. capital expenditures for the first nine months of the fiscal year were $196 million.
our capex by operating segment for the nine-month period was as follows: $163 million in uniform rental and facility services, $21 million in first aid and safety, and $12 million in all other. we expect fourth-quarter 2018 capex to be approximately $65 million. as of february 28, total debt was $2.722 billion, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2.535 billion of long-term debt. at february 28, our leverage was 2.3 times debt-to-ebitda.
overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately two times debt-to-ebitda at may 31, 2018. that concludes our prepared remarks. we are happy to answer your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll hear first from manav patnaik with barclays.
greg bardi -- barclays investment bank -- vice president
hi, this is actually greg calling on for manav. just wanted to hit on g&k first, if that's ok. maybe i missed it, but could you give the revenue and growth rate you saw in the third quarter? and then maybe more broadly touch on any early signs you're seeing from a potential revenue-synergy opportunity?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
third-quarter revenue was slightly over $230 million, and it was down about 4.7%. i would tell you, greg, that being able to specifically identify that g&k revenue gets harder and harder as we have, as you heard us say, closed 60 locations and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with the cintas locations, so getting a little harder and harder to identify. but those were the estimated third-quarter numbers. from a revenue-synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there.
we are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. so we're moving fairly slowly on that. i would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20. but from our standpoint today, early signs are we feel pretty good about that opportunity in the future.
greg bardi -- barclays investment bank -- vice president
ok. and then from the core cintas side, i know it's a metric we don't look at quite as much anymore, but maybe some color on what you're seeing from the net add-stops and hiring from some of your existing customers.
paul adler -- vice president and treasurer
yes, greg. it's paul. so the add-stops metric was positive. i think the only thing really of note was that we had some good lift in the dust mats area, carpeted mats.
wet and cold winters with a lot of snow, good precipitation definitely give us a little bit of a lift, but outside of that, nothing significant to add especially in terms of anything in the garment area.
greg bardi -- barclays investment bank -- vice president
ok. thanks, guys.

thank you. our next question will come from toni kaplan with morgan stanley.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- executive director
hey, good afternoon. just following up on the g&k, you mentioned that it was down 4.7% in the quarter. i think last quarter you mentioned in your guidance $895 million to $915 million for the year. so i'm just wondering, is that still like a good number for the year? or was this quarter a little bit better than what you're expecting previously?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
we have been very pleased with the performance of that g&k revenue block so far, and it was a little bit better than we expected in the third quarter. and i would say we're going to be at around $920 million for the year, which is slightly better than that range that we gave last quarter. and we continue to see very positive things from not just the revenue performance but overall performance.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- executive director
ok, got it. and this quarter, i guess the legacy cintas organic growth decelerated for the second quarter to 6.5%. so i just wanted to get a little bit of extra color on sort of what you're seeing in that cintas legacy business. like, should we expect -- i guess g&k will be inorganic.
so of course, the fourth quarter will be even lower. but just on the legacy cintas business, is there something sort of driving the deceleration? or is it just that the comps are getting harder?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
we believe that the execution and the performance of the business is still very good. we're very pleased with it. and as you probably noticed, we increased our guidance for the fourth quarter as well. so we still feel very good about the performance.
look, in every quarter, there are puts and takes. for the first half of the year, for example, we got a little bit of an energy headwind in the third quarter. last year's third quarter was very strong. and so there are puts and takes in every quarter, but we're still in a range where we want to be, and we feel like we're operating very efficiently throughout this fiscal year.
when you think about our fourth-quarter guidance, we effectively raised the bottom end about $67 million and the top end about $22 million, and, again, a bit of a signal that we still feel good about the business. and generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, i would expect that the legacy cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter. we won't report it that way because we're co-mingling the g&k and the cintas business, but we feel good about it.
toni kaplan -- morgan stanley -- executive director
excellent. thanks so much.

thank you. we'll now go to hamzah mazari with macquarie capital.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie group -- analyst
good afternoon, thank you. the first question is just if you could give us a sense of how to think about utilization across your facilities. i realize facility capacity is measured locally versus nationally, but maybe just give us some sense how many facilities are at, say, 75% plus utilization. what's underutilized in your platform? i know you're going through a consolidation as well.
so just any color where are we, utilization-wise, however you want to answer that.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
sure. hamzah, as you mentioned, capacity is local, and there are some markets that are reaching their capacity. there are others that have plenty. when we need extra capacity, we will do certain short-term steps before building a fully new facility, like we may add a washer and a dryer to our wash alley.
we may bump out our wash alley and make it even larger, and that will add capacity. and we usually do those things as we start to creep up on the capacity, and that allows us to expand the existing capacity. we'll continue to do those things we have in the last several years. but we will also add, i would say, something in the way of two to four plants per year.
we have done that this fiscal year, and i would expect it will continue to do something like that into the future as we -- or if we continue to grow like we have been. does that answer your question?
hamzah mazari -- macquarie group -- analyst
yes, that's very helpful. and then maybe any of you -- i know it's early days. there's low visibility. but any thoughts on the trump tariffs and how that impacts your business either directly or indirectly and anything you're hearing from customers, anything you're hearing from your procurement guys? just any sense, early sense of that.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
well, we didn't fare too well in the market today. i'll start by that. i -- we're not seeing things from our customers yet. that's too early to tell.
certainly, we do have some things that we source out of china. we're keeping our eyes on it and how they may be affected by the list of things that may have a tariff. but i think it's too early to tell because we really don't know what's on and what's not quite yet, so too early to tell. we're keeping our eyes on it.
our goal will be if we do see some things that may be affected into the future, our goal is to do our best to resource or find efficiencies to offset. and i think we've done a fairly good job of that over the years.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie group -- analyst
great. last question and i'll turn it over. just any thoughts on how much of your marketplace is self-operated on the uniform side? and any change you're seeing in terms of outsourcing trends? has that been pretty consistent? any thoughts there? appreciate it. thank you.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
we haven't -- we talked a lot about the no programmer new business. so that is new customers that weren't in a uniform rental program previously. and we haven't seen a change. we're still having success in finding new businesses to put into uniform rental programs, so not much change in our third quarter relative to the previous several quarters.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie group -- analyst
great, thank you.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll go to scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer & company -- managing director
thanks, good afternoon. two questions. first one, could you comment on sales force productivity? and obviously, you're progressing nicely through your integration. could you just talk to some of the developments you've had there and what's left to go and how it's working? thanks
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
we're seeing some encouraging signs, scott. our productivity has improved sequentially through this fiscal year, and that's with quite a few more salespeople certainly than a year ago as we brought on the g&k sales team. so we're seeing some encouraging productivity signs, but certainly, we have a ways to go. we still have productivity improvements to get, and we're confident that those will come over the course of the fourth quarter and fiscal '19.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer & company -- managing director
great. i appreciate it. then my follow-up is on capex. if my numbers are right, it looks like the guidance reduced by maybe $15 million or $20 million this year.
if you could please correct me on that and let me know. and where is that coming from? is that a push-out? is there anything changing with sap? or if you could tell us where -- if there is a change, where it is occurring? thanks.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yes, i think it's -- more than anything, it's timing. we do have a lot going on in terms of the g&k integration, the sap implementation. and some projects just tend to get pushed a little bit as we move through those integrations market by market. so i would just call it timing more than anything.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer & company -- managing director

our next question will come from judah sokel with j.p.morgan.
judah sokel -- j.p.morgan -- vice president
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if you can give us an update on the four buckets that you've talked about in the past of cost synergies, which we had talked about, $130 million to $140 million. where -- how are we progressing on each of those?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
so the -- let me start with the $15 million that we talked about in the third quarter. about half is g&a, and the other half would be in the gross margin. so from a g&a perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that sg&a down from post-acquisition levels. so we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do.
so, for example, we still have an it presence from the legacy g&k team as we continue to roll off of that system. and so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. the other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. that is the cost of running our facilities.
and as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. and so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. so for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. and we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market.
but the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. from a service perspective, i haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. that -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. we've started some of that in some markets.
we'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. but indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. and the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. as you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, sow it out, get it into our distribution center, and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right.
so we are making the -- some really nice progress there. it just takes more time to realize it. so all in all, judah, i feel good about all four of those buckets.
judah sokel -- j.p.morgan -- vice president
those are really helpful color. and one other question about the 2019 comment that you guys had mentioned that you expect to see acceleration throughout the year. is that purely a function of the g&k decline moderating and perhaps switching to growth? or is that in the core legacy cintas business also you're expecting some sort of pickup in that business?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
no, more than anything, it's seeing the g&k business begin to level and then start to grow and more than anything, seeing the productivity improve in our sales team that i mentioned a bit ago.
judah sokel -- j.p.morgan -- vice president
understood. thank you very much.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer

we'll now hear from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
hi, good afternoon. thank you for taking my questions. hey, mike, are you seeing a positive impact in the business overall just from tax legislation just from your customers? maybe any pickup in hiring or being easier to sell? it's now been approximately three months. i was wondering what you're seeing on that side of it.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
we're -- shlomo, we're hearing some anecdotal things that the sentiment is good. i would say from the standpoint of impact to the p&l, probably not much yet. you still have to take the time to sell it and get people into uniform or get the mats out there. and as you know, we're kind of a weekly billing business and it takes a little time to accumulate some of that revenue.
and so it just takes a little time. so i would say the impact in our third quarter has not been very significant, but sentiment seems to be pretty good.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
so would you expect that to be a lift in future quarters?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
i think certainly that if we see our customers spending some of the cash that they are getting from the tax reform, yes, i think that will be a benefit. it's hard to tell how much, but i think that will certainly be a good thing for all of us.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
ok, great. and then could you talk a little bit about just what drove some of the sequentially improved results in the other businesses? is it -- what's going on in fire safety? anything in particular that's going on you could call out?
paul adler -- vice president and treasurer
shlomo, in fire, nothing in particular to call out. i mean, as we mentioned in kind of our remarks, that is a business that has grown very strongly organically for some time now. and the expectation is typically high single digits, about 10%. so as mike said, sometimes, you have some puts and takes each quarter and there might be a little bit of a volatility but nothing to call out.
so it's a good, strong, growing business. and then the direct sale business, they did have a very strong third quarter. they did have some nice wins, nothing to the extent of a southwest airlines roll-out that i mentioned in my -- in the comments, but still some nice good wins. and truth be told, last year's third quarter was a little light.
so they had some nice, favorable comparisons in q3. and as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, remember that direct sale business will have a very difficult comp due to southwest rolling out last year.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
and if you don't mind, just a little housekeeping. what's the pro forma tax rate you're using for the $1.37 eps number?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
it's 32% for the quarter. and so based on where we have -- had guided you previously, there's probably about $0.06 of a tax benefit in that $1.37 that is non-u.s. tax reform related.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
so pro forma tax rate and pre-tax income, you would use 32% to get down to your -- to the $1.37?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yes. for the quarter only, not year to date but for the quarter only.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel nicolaus -- managing director
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from andy whittmann with r.w. baird.
andrew whittmann -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
great. where will i start? i guess, let's talk about the $40 million payment to your partners. i assume that most of that was in the rental segment, but was there any amount that's notable that we should know for our models that was in the other segment?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
it was about 2.5% of revenue in each segment, andy.
andrew whittmann -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
ok, ok, 2.5% revenue in each segment, perfect. and then maybe just on the guidance, looking at it another way, it seems like -- well, it looks like if you adjust for the tax rate bump, it gives you about $0.25 by our estimates versus what you would've had previously. and yet, there's a pretty good guidance bump add that you've mentioned. i was just wondering -- it sounds like g&k revenue is ahead of plan.
can you maybe talk, mike, about some of the other factors that helped you get the upside and maybe the significance of them?
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
the good news -- i'll start with there are two more workdays and that certainly is beneficial, two more workdays than in the third quarter, same as last year though. year over year, it's the same. but sequentially, that will help us. andy, it's continuing to sell.
it is working through the integration activities. we're going to get more leverage as we go into that fourth quarter. and we've seen some really nice things in the sg&a area. so i think it's just a lot of the execution along with some healthy revenue.
andrew whittmann -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
got it. thanks. maybe my last question is just trying to understand a little bit more detail on the characteristics of your growth in uniform rental. and you guys have answered this question about kind of add-stops, new business versus no programmers and all those things.
but one of the questions i wanted to get a sense for you about is specifically on penetration of existing customers. if you were to break up that as a bucket of your growth, new sales in the quarter, how significant or how much of the growth rate is based on sales to existing customers in particular, whether it's through cross-sell, upsell, and maybe not including pricing? if you could just help us understand how important that is to your growth, that would be helpful.
j. michael hansen -- senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
certainly, andy, it's important. it's not as big of a driver as new business and really has never been, but it is important to us. and while we haven't gotten specific in terms of magnitude, quantify magnitude, it is certainly second most to the new business effort that we have. so it's an important factor.
we think there are lots of opportunities remaining in that area as -- particularly as we continue to penetrate with things like carhartt and chef works garments and with our signature series restroom products. so still a lot of opportunity left but it's an important factor.
andrew whittmann -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
thank you for that. maybe my last, last question. i was wondering -- you've been -- you've commented over the last couple of quarters on the pricing environment. you said it's been always competitive but you're getting some.
how would you characterize the price that you realized in the third quarter versus what you've seen in the last few quarters?
