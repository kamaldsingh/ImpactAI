[operator instructions] and our first question comes from david lewis from morgan stanley. your line is open.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning. congrats on the quarter and the guide. and miles i had two questions for you. the first on diabetes, and the second on the outlook for the year. so just starting with diabetes. ada, miles i should add some concerns around libre 2, icgm designation, should investors read anything into the lack of approval and what's your confidence level on icgm approval and what does the trend in bgm this particular quarter tell us about the libre adoption?
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
i'm going to give you a couple of answers here. one, no, we shouldn't have concern. we're confident that we're going to have the approval that we expect and what we applied for. so i know that there is -- there is always uncertainty until the day comes and the questions from investors that now we're confident. and actually, let me ask, our cf -- coo to give you a little bit of more background and detail on that.
robert b. ford -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i mean we -- dave, we filed this in icgm. we made that comment in our last earnings. and when we filed as an icgm, the standards and special controls for the icgm, they are very clear, and they're very transparent as it relates to accuracy, thresholds, alarms, sensor shut-offs, etc. so, and we wouldn't have filed an icgm if we felt that we were going to fall short of those special controls. in fact, we were encouraged by the agency to file libre 2 as an icgm. so i know people want to speculate and kind of tie it to the exact date. we're not behind our timelines. so we're not going to expect there an exact date here, but we expect it relatively soon.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. very, very helpful. and then the second thing, miles for you, just guidance for the year. so, the guidance rate suggests you obviously see 2019 as a year of acceleration over '18. i'm just sort of curious, what gets better into the second half of the year and if you think about the middle part of the range versus the upper part of the range, and what are the key success factors into the back half that gets you to that top end of the range?thanks so much.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i think first of all about the guidance. we are seeing strength in our growth drivers. we've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. we're going to be opening up the capacity in new manufacturing and so forth to supplement libre. the alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. mitraclip is picking up momentum. a lot of the businesses that i've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time-to-time are also on sequential improvement, which i'm happy to see. i'm never quite satisfied with that, but the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point of care diagnostics business, the rapid diagnostics business, which is primarily the alere acquisition.
they are also all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've worked for etc. so based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that frankly our growth rate on the topline going forward, we're sort of seeing that 7% to 8% range and i challenged the team, i said this is temporary for the quarter, for the half year thing or do we feel fairly sustainable about this and we feel sustainable about it.
so i think that's all good. and then with record earnings, there is a step-up in earnings here in the second half earnings growth rate and it's just an unusual quarter. i mean we always target as you know at the beginning of the year double-digit growth. we always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. that's no different now. so in the second half, our earnings remained strong.
i don't know -- i'm kind of -- i feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say, and we never fall short. so it's 18% on the bottom line right now. so, you're asking me about what do we do to get the high end of the range. something [indecipherable] isn't that good enough. it's a pretty healthy growth rate. so 7% to 8% on the top and high-double-digit teens on the bottom, i think is -- is probably best in class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to.
and quite frankly with the breadth of products launching and roll-outs, and obviously there's always challenges somewhere in the world and in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas. and i think that's a pretty good investment.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. well said. thanks so much. congrats again.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robbie marcus from jpmorgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and congrats on a good quarter.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
maybe two product questions for you. i want to hit on mitraclip and alinity. maybe you could comment on the status cms reimbursement in mitraclip. it doesn't seem to have hindered your growth at all in the quarter, but maybe just give us some update on the timelines. and then maybe some considerations for the trend line of update going forward there, once you do get approval?
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
okay. i'm going to have robert answer that question for you and we'll come back to alinity.
robert b. ford -- president and chief operating officer
robbie, so you saw we had a great quarter in mitraclip global sales over 30%, really driven by us over 50%, the majority of that growth in us really coming through increased productivity in the existing accounts. so we obviously, we're constantly doing market development, opening new accounts, but majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. so we continue to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. and when you do this, they had this direct impact in account, utilization and productivity, international was up also double digits in the quarter.
you've got japan where we believe there is a significant opportunity for us long-term there where we're building our capabilities in japan. and europe saw a rebound in q2 versus where we were in q1. i think the team today, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year.
so we think there is a lot of sustainability here, not only in the us, i mean our penetration rates here in terms of the opportunity are still kind of low-single digits. so we got a lot of runway here. regarding your question on cms, i mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between cms and the physician societies. we expect the ncd to be open up very soon as part of that coordination.
as i say, we're not going to forecast the exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year end early next year. but as you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. we have seen a dozen or so private commercial insurance companies already reflect updates to their coverage to include the new indication. obviously the larger segment there is the medicare segment, but it's good to kind of see that traction in the private segment. so very good quarter. we continue to see this expansion in the second-in the second half of the year and toward the end of the year looking at achieving the cms reimbursement.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and then following up on alinity. this is one -- it hits all of your different product lines in diagnostics. so it's hard to really pick out, but maybe you could just give us a status update on the progress of the launch in europe and the just starting launch in the us and maybe any competitive data points you could give us. we see some of your competitors struggling both on the topline and the margin side as it relates to competitive systems. anything you're seeing out in the market that could be useful. appreciate it.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
sure. well, so, firstly, you made the comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. that's true. and these are six different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. there is a dedicated blood and plasma screening system, and then of course hematology and molecular. and they're all at various stages of rollout. the one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of europe.
we're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the united states and china and southeast asia where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new alinity systems. so i'd say we're running as fast as we can, i think at this point in europe and -- that's gone pretty well. there is over 3,000 systems placed now, running tests, generating revenue was etc. we do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, etc. we can't -- we measure what is called test of record when the [indecipherable] count is up and running, generating results, generating tests etc. and so i'd say that process is going well.
that's going to begin to pick up momentum in the united states as we're getting more and more menu breadth same with china. we're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. we're talking hundreds of tests. we did recently get approval for the alinity-s, the blood and plasma screening system. today we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. this is a -- it's an important transition product that labs i think will find more efficient, more economic etc, but that's a plus.
we closed and started up the japanese red cross, which is the largest japanese blood screening organization and we took that from a long-standing japanese competitor. so that was -- that was a big win for us. so there's just a lot of success that way. hematology is in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the early stage of rolling out and which is why this will be, i guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it. as we look over the next, call it five to seven years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume.
and to that end, i think we quoted you before, it remains true in accounts where we already have the business we're winning above 95% of the time and in accounts where we do not have the business and there is an entrenched competitor of ours. we're winning about 60% of the time. those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far over now what i said is over 3,000 instruments. tell us that we've got a very competitive system, we do run into on the occasional accounts, heavy duty price cutting.
we've got a very disciplined system. our pricing and contracting in accounts we have not had to do that. i think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. so we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive, it's borne out by the win rates, no matter what type of account, it's unprecedented to launch this many systems across the board in all areas. so i think this only picks up momentum, gets better as the assay menu expands and as there is some experience in the field with the analyzers.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you and good morning. just two quick questions. one for miles in a big picture and then one quick financial question, if ok. miles. if ok, i want to ask a question on the management team additions that you announced recently. congrats on hiring lisa to run devices. and i guess my question is when robert was promoted as coo back in october of last year, abbott said that robert would keep devices. so just wondering if you could comment on kind of the reasons for the change what robert will do with all those new found free time and investors are always curious about your long-term plan. so it's a question on the recent hire.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
okay. well, i can tell you he is not playing golf. we -- i'd say a couple of things. first of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business, because he's been responsible for the bringing on board st. jude as we acquired that. he was integral to that entire integration. we went through with st. jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at abbott.
and i guess i would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for our commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales of the customers, etc, but also manufacturing, r&d, technical support service, etc. we like all those functions reporting into one gm, and -- so we realigned st. jude.
we did the same with alere quite frankly when we took them over. and so each of the businesses has full integrated general management responsibility and that was a transition. and robert led that. it's all in place that meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. we replaced some who had left us as part of the st. jude or alere acquisitions and so forth. so we went through a management transition and at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here.
quite certainly there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time and a lot of our managers are long term abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization and the new structure to that organization that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it a decade for what i think it's going to be pretty robust growth.
so in that, we needed to replace the evp role that robert has held previous to his chief operating officer role. we did that. we went outside for that and of course sourced lisa, who we think has a terrific background and experience for that. we're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience, and great energy level up into the company. so we're very pleased with that.
we went through a little further, i'd say, organization change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps [indecipherable] in some cases into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth, capital improvement, plant building etc, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. and to give us more focus around it, we've done some of that adjusting. i feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well.
obviously, we read into robert who is in his mid-40s moving up into the coo role that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time, read between the lines. and so there's the preparation process is going on, and i think one of the most important things i can do after leading the company for so long is to make sure that when a transition comes nobody notices, and the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company, its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now.
and from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. and i feel like of all the sort of track record or legacies that i can give this company, i think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. so you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what i would call it with no speed bumps. and i think that actually is going exceptionally well.
will i give you a timeframe? no. do i think we should be nervous about it? no. i think that this company is so poised to perform well across the board for years to come that i've got a great confidence in that continuity and the management team, because we've got a nice mix here, very experienced and trained abbott people, and people we brought from other companies on the outside like lisa. and i think the mix we've got in that team is exceptional.
robert's been with the company over 20 years. i've known him every bit of those 20 plus years and i think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience perspective, everything you would look for in a leader, the coo of the company. so from my perspective, i think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
very, very helpful. thank you so much, miles. that's great perspective. and just -- it seems like an odd transition, but i do have a little question on the tax rate. just quickly for brian. you guys have been doing a great job over the last couple of years of kind of slowly and steadily bringing the tax rate down. and i know you made comments on the year, but maybe you could just talk bigger picture. is -- where are you in that process and are there current rates that we're seeing here today sustainable down here in the kind of lowish teens? thank you.
brian b. yoor -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, bob. we always set the tax rate where we think it's sustainable. we don't like to be bounced around. we want to be steady. and we assess the rigs [phonetic] they come out. we had a series of rigs come out just recently and digested those. we're always adapting to that and adapting to the situation to be as efficient as we can here.
14.5% is where i call the sustainable rate right now as we look forward. i will say and we can't predict the future, but there is another series of clarity around rigs that will come out in q3, and when that happens, we will digest that and adapt accordingly as well. but as we sit here today, we're happy with the efficiency of our tax rate and continue to manage it for sustainability, and we just don't want to see it bumping around on you or us.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kristen stewart from barclays. your line is open.
kristen stewart -- barclays -- analyst
hi, congrats on a great quarter and thanks for the question. miles, i was wondering if you could just talk through your thinking on just the level of investments in the company and just how you think about how much of this really impressive topline you let flow through, and then also just from a capital allocation perspective, how are you just thinking about going forward with the company just given the growth dynamics that you have and/or opportunities you could see to maybe strengthen some of the other business lines that maybe offer a little bit more lackluster growth with the medical devices? thanks.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
okay. well, i give you a couple of respective. first of all, the great thing is, we've got a lot of things to invest in. from a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt, we did. we've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at this point. and as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it.
so the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion, and we put a fair amount into both diagnostics and libre at this point. we're investing in expansion of plant manufacturing for mitraclip and other products. so given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion at appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. and so there is capital use etc, there.
will we continue to pay down debt? we will. we'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense. it's the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. we'll maintain a healthy strong dividend. we increased it substantially at the end of last year. we'll continue to grow our dividend given where the p/e is now. i have been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate, upward dividend funds or happy is difficult. but that's a nice problem to have.
we will continue to grow our dividend. that's has been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. and then, it's not always that prudent to buy back shares, the timing matters, the return matters, etc. is it an option? yeah, it is. probably won't get too carried away because frankly we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. so it's always an option as it presents itself.
we just got a lot we can do. if you're asking about m&a and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to make it worth it to invest in. we've got so many organic growth opportunities that while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, i can't tell you that's real front burner right now. we don't ignore it. we don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in.
we just did a small acquisition in germany, that's a nice adjunctive thing to our diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. there are things like that that i think are valuable for us. but we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics even nutrition and pharma that we're just not out cutting [phonetic] real hard on the m&a front right now, nor do i foresee that being true for quite a while. so that's the capital side.
on the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. and i doubt that there is a general manager or business at abbott that wouldn't claim that if we give them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. so we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown on the fire of the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors.
i think that's always a balance because there is always some investor who thinks there is -- there must be an extra penny in the quarter and i was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue, another penny. as you do know, the issue here is much bigger than a penny. we've got tremendous growth. our topline, we're accelerating, it's strong, it's sustainable. this isn't about a penny in a given quarter. this is about a pretty healthy sales growth rate and commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. and it's not a coming quarter, it's coming year.
so you raised the right question is how do we keep investing in the spending in r&d and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth and we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher.
kristen stewart -- barclays -- analyst
okay. then just one question on how do you view the medical device business, growth was phenomenal this quarter. how do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth. it seems that medical devices has a bit of a tale of two cities with several businesses reporting really nice strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. how do you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there? thanks so much for taking the questions.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, you've got a mix of businesses here. you've got some that are little more mature than others. some that have brand new products that are terrific innovations. in general, in medical devices, innovation is what drives the growth. and over time, that's the case. and different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation. we believe there is still a lot of opportunity there.
i remember in my discussions with dan starks when we were negotiating over the acquisition of st. jude. dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline at st. jude was under-appreciated, and that -- in their own internal models that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. the street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, etc. but, dan was right, and i think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from st. jude because it's been performing at sort of the 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market either replacing older products or just simply bringing new products all together.
so i'd say the first thing about medical devices is, you've got to keep innovating in new spaces, mitraclip's new space heart failure and heartmate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, etc. libre is that. libre is unique. it approaches a mass market, not a niche market. most medical devices address niches of therapy, but diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s and that is massive. it's unlike anything seen before in device or diagnostic businesses. and so there is just an enormous opportunity there.
to be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. and so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. and so, i think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after a much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. more people will have access. there will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. and then finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. and i'd say, well, i'm always disappointed if they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but i am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. we've seen that in crm, we've seen it in neuromod, we've seen it in even epd and stents and so forth. we're seeing incremental improvement.
some of these businesses, more mature businesses may not see strong or high-single-digit or double-digit growth, but i think they are still capable of pretty strong growth in the low-to-mid single-digit area and there's still a lot of upside. if we take a crm business from what is flat slightly negative 2%, [phonetic] 3% or 4% that's a pretty big bump in growth. we'd be -- if it was going from 10 to 14, we'd be all excited about it. so the same incremental growth improvement, i think, is possible. it's just at a lower level.
so i think that there is a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing. there's always going to be new products like a libre or a mitraclip or a heartmate that singularly for a period of time, disproportionately drive the overall growth. one of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is, there is always going to be somewhere that's growing that lane, and in other places where we're innovating for the future.
kristen stewart -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from joanne wuensch from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everybody and thank you for taking the question. i'd like to spend a little bit of time on nutrition, particularly international nutrition and the adult piece of that really did well in the quarter. is there anything you can give us as an update on that particular franchise?
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. so we had a, as you've noticed, sequential improvement in our nutrition business. we're very pleased with the performance. we continue to see kind of above-market growth in several of the countries. we've made a lot of enhancements and changes in people and strategies to enhance our competitiveness over the years, new products execution and we get to see that. we do think it is sustainable. we are executing well. we kind of see the market in that 3% to 4% range. so we're always striving for something above that and you saw that again in this quarter with a 5% kind of growth, and good execution in our adult business, specifically coming out of asia.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
the ous business, joanne, was up little over 10% and in the adult -- ous adult business. and a lot of that is new product innovation, new formats, expansion in given markets like vietnam and other places where we've got pretty good strong holds, but also a lot of opportunity for further growth. so we put a lot more attention on some of those. i'd say historically in this business, the us and china always get all the attention, but there's a lot of opportunity. and so robert said southeast asian markets and others where there's still lot of growth, india and the like, and particularly in the adult segment.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. and as my second question on of the ""problem children"" in medical devices is in neuromodulation. can you walk us through a pathway to the recovery in that? thanks.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so we saw an improvement in q2. obviously, that's not our -- that's not our landing spot. we are obviously not where we want to be, but an improvement there. we completed the sales force expansion that we've been talking about. we increased the sales force by about 40% and when you go through something like that, joanne, there is some disruption that occurs in terms of cutting the territories and the trading etc. so we completed that and now obviously the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team and we saw that in the second quarter.
if you look at some of the kpis, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates, we saw definitely sequential improvement versus q1 and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. a big portion of this also is, i'd say product innovation lifecycle. you've seen a couple quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from the competitors in this space. that's a key driver also.
so sales force, productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation output. we've made -- doubled the investment in that r&d business over the last couple of years and we'll start to see some output of that in the second half of this year, beginning of next year in terms of new products that will provide. i'd say more for the sales team to kind of work with.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, operator. we'll take one more question.
operator
thank you. and our final question comes from matthew taylor from ubs. your line is open.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the question. i wanted to circle back on libre on two points. so, the first is that you mentioned that you're working on increasing the capacity. there was an article yesterday in reuters that said that you're expanding capacity by three or five times. and so, if we think about libre this year, it's approaching maybe $2 billion based on consensus. does that mean that ultimately you think it could be $6 billion to $10 billion type product as you go mass market? and can you talk about how you can step on the gas in the second half of the year with that additional capacity in the approval of libre 2 to more rapidly expand use?
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
man, you are one aggressive guy. i remember like at this call [phonetic] or this question last quarter, i can't recall if it was you on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh three months later, it's $10 billion. i've got the same ambitions, to be honest. i just wouldn't have expected him 90 days later. but to answer your question, i think that kind of potential is there. i think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big.
but will we -- do i think we'll get the $5 billion and do i think we'll do it in a reasonable time? $5 billion [indecipherable] yes, i do. and i think it's done. the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. and i think it's just as i've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mass market product, not a niche.
and it's designed for that, it's priced for that, it's a very profitable product. and we're going through the large-scale scale up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. so do i think it can grow to that sort of level? i won't -- i won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but i would say that i think it's got enormous potential and it's got potential beyond glucose. it's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time.
we have r&d programs under way, not only for the repeated enhancement improvement, expansion of libre, but also into other categories beyond diabetes and other analyzers and so forth. so i think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that today people aren't even contemplating with the product. we're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous, but there is so much more beyond that, that i think at least your aspirational consideration to be honest has validity [phonetic] i just -- i'm not ready to put any numbers around it.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. and then maybe one last follow-up. that was a great answer, but just wanted to get your feedback on what you think is misunderstood about libre today when you get feedback from investors that bubbles up to you, where do you think that the internal view of libre really differs from the street's perception or people's perception?
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
[indecipherable] only ask the coo. he's been living with it a long time.
robert b. ford -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i think when we went out about this several years ago, the challenge here, matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from the interstitial fluid. navigator when we had launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. it was very accurate and we were able to get an accurate reading. the challenge that we went about with libre is how to do that in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and for -- and for all of that.
so that was what we really went after is, how can you get that accurate reading at a cost position at the core of libre and you might remember at the time navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. in the core of libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of navigator, which provides accurate reliable readings. but we're able to do that a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community, and the health systems to cover it. it wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. they were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor based glucose monitoring. it was just -- can i now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale and miles has talked about this about mass scale, that's what we went after 10 years ago. and that's at the core and i think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on well accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level.
and the reality is accuracy is obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy and the fact that we price it at a different price point, wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something. we just had a different strategy, and different view of what we could do.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
the only product out there that the street has been able to compare it to is expenses and high cost, and aimed at a niche in the united states. ours is not expensive and it's not high cost. it does not lack for clinical performance accuracy or any of the like. but because the manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we are able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. it's a highly profitable product. so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is successful in terms of profit. that's not been compromised at all. it has a completely different design and approach and cost structure. it relies on scale for that cost.
and we've actually seen improving gross margin, we told you before the gross margin is over 60%. it is and rising, and that's where the heavy capital investment. so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. so i think among the misunderstandings out there, i think, people say, well, geez, how do you make money? oh, we make money. we do just fine thank you.
and the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. i guess there are some days when we think if the healthcare market community insurers, payers, congress, patients whatever always think it's got to be lower cost, the healthcare's got be more affordable, here's your example. and it is -- it's massively so. and so we've going at it with that approach to make it broadly available, broadly in this case means 80 million people worldwide, that's unprecedented.
so i'm not sure that -- i'm not sure that the device community has totally understood that because it's so different. but we keep saying so, and i think now is as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity. so that literally every 90 days, we're adding another increment significant increment in capacity. we will not be capacity constrained and that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet.
so i think there's a lot of opportunity here. and i think too -- i think opportunities -- there is opportunity for a number of things like this as i mentioned earlier in what's called the wearables market. the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then i think we're going to see a very different market expansion.

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by abbott. it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission.
i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing, and acquisitions.
scott leinenweber -- vice president, investor relations, licensing, and acquisitions
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today are miles white, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; robert ford, president and chief operating officer, and brian yoor, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. miles will provide opening remarks and brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. following their comments, we'll take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to our annual report on securities and exchange commission form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018.
abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. please note, that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, eps and line items of the p&l will be for continuing operations only.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.
unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.
with that, i will now turn the call over to miles.
miles d. white -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, scott. good morning. today we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all four businesses exceeding expectations. i'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. over the past two years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%, and importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio, and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward.
based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. while we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, i'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well.
i'll start our medical devices business with freestyle libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base as reflected by organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. we also continue to make excellent progress, expanding reimbursement and access into us, where libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. libre offers a unique value proposition and that's by design. it provides great clinical benefits and we priced it to ensure affordability -- there is recognized that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for libre, which helps lower out-of-pocket cost even further for patients.
as i've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for libre to meet demand. the first wave of that expansion will come on line in the next couple of months, followed by cadence of incremental capacity after that. there is a massive population that needs help managing their diabetes and our intent is to make libre broadly accessible to all of them.
turning to our structural heart business, where we achieved mid teens growth. this was led by mitraclip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. and mitraclip grew more than 50% in the us, where we recently received a new expanded indication.
earlier this week, we announced us approval of our fourth generation mitraclip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating [technical issues] disease.
we've been building our position in structural heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including tendyne and cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. triclip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve and amplatzer amulet, our left atrial appendage device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.
with the rapid adoption of mitraclip in a highly under-penetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies, targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our structural heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.
next, diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. we're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing in europe. with the launch of alinity, it's helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business.
we're now also in the early stages of launching alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in europe. in the us, we're making steady progress, achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. and just last week, we announced fda approval of alinity-s for blood and plasma screening.
abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space, while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. the global rollout of alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our diagnostics business for sustainable strong growth going forward.
so in summary, all four of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. our growth is strong. it's accelerating and it's sustainable. we've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of healthcare, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. and today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year.
i'll now turn the call over to brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. brian?
brian b. yoor -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
okay. thanks, miles. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
turning to our results. sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. sales of medical devices grew 10.5%, with double-digit growth in electrophysiology, heart failure, structural heart and diabetes care. in nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by strong growth in adult nutrition. sales in established pharmaceuticals grew 6.1%, with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. and sales increased 6.2% in diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and sequential improvements in point of care and rapid diagnostics.
exchange had an unfavorable impact on total abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in april.
regarding other aspects of the p&l, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales, adjusted r&d investment was 7.1% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense was 29.9% of sales. the second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15% due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the us tax reform regulations. our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.
turning to our outlook for the full year. we now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year.
we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. this is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our alinity diagnostic system as well as investments in libre capacity expansion.
we forecast adjusted r&d investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense of around 29.5% of sales. and as i mentioned previously, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.
turning to our outlook for the third quarter. we forecast adjusted eps of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales.
we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense of around 29% of sales.
before we open the call for questions, i'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. for established pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-to-high single-digit growth. in nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. in diagnostics, we forecast abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point of care to grow high-single digits. and in rapid diagnostics, we forecast low-to-mid single-digit growth. and finally, in medical devices, we forecast high-single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.
with that, we'll now open the call up for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. and our first question comes from bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, and thank you. and good morning and congrats on all the success and progress you guys are having. so -- robert, so much that i could ask about here. but i'll go high level with my question and ask if you wouldn't mind, putting that $5 earnings or at least $5 in earnings for 2021 guidance number in perspective for us given that, that $5 is above even what the street was modeling for 2022.
and specifically, i guess the way i'd ask the question is, i'm sure investors would love some perspective on how covid testing impacts that guidance, how you're thinking about the base business and maybe most importantly, given how much higher $5 is, compared to expectations, i'm sure investors would love to hear your early thoughts on whether or not abbott can grow at its sort of traditional rate off of that $5 number next year?
so sorry for the long winded question, but i would love any perspective. thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure, bob. you hit on all the points there, i guess. we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. i think one of the things as we're going into it is that, we knew, i mean a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in eps. and that wasn't -- that's not the case for abbott. we're not coming out of a hole. and as i said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019.
what i can say is that, we are, bob and myself as we manage the business especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at two year cagrs across our businesses. and i think that's the right way to look at it is to kind of look at what happened in 2020 and it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us, so we're looking on a two-year -- on a two-year cagr basis.
the points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at and we've been modeling several different scenarios. so i'll touch on those because they're all elements of how -- of how we build to our at least $5. first of all, obviously covid testing, it's been a big driver for us and it will continue to be -- continue to be a big driver. i expect testing demand is still going to remain high, even as the vaccines roll out.
i don't think we have even seen testing demand peak yet. so we've built a lot of capacity and we've talked about that over -- over last year, the capacity that we've built. but we didn't put it all in. and we didn't put it all in into that -- into that $5. so, but we don't all see it going away either. but there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now.
the other part of our forecast here without a doubt is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the covid, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. these are important procedures and life changing procedures, they're important routine test to do. so you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely.
and what we saw in q3 of last year, as those rates, hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. and we actually saw a growth in several months in q3 and going into q4 and obviously that got impacted probably around thanksgiving. so, we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5 which is a recovery of these businesses, you know, at a similar rate of what we saw in q3 and somewhere in the fall.
i'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses, that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. we expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. i mean, i think nutrition had a really great year last year. i expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. epd should get sequentially better. we saw that in q4. early indications in january show that recovery continuing. and quite frankly, libre, i expect it to do better with all the -- with all the innovation and investment we're making there.
so those businesses will do well. and then, the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could -- we could do with more investment, whether it's sg&a and more specifically in r&d and accelerate some of our programs. i think you saw some of that in our q4 results where we beat consensus, while at the same time investing more in r&d and sg&a.
so, we looked at these four -- these four elements here, bob and we modeled it in variety of different ways. and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. quite frankly if anything, we could have significant upside over here, and this is really going to depend a little bit on how we think about covid testing going forward.
so i kind of saw the $5 here as ok, it's a 37% increase versus 2020 which grew 13% and we've got probable upside to that. while at the same time, on opportunity to invest in the business, invest in sg&a, more specifically in r&d, i think we've got a leading covid test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all-in. quite frankly, if i had put all that capacity and i think, i think maybe you would have had a little bit time believing that. but it's there. and i think we've got an exciting base business like you talked, like you mentioned here that is poised for recovery.
i mean, we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. so i think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point factoring all those elements in here and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, thank you for that. that's a thorough overview. and then just the one follow up would be, obviously, it's the beginning of 2021, but does that high level of earnings for this year, does that mean you might not be able to grow off of that in 2022 because there is so much testing in 2021 or just give us some thoughts on abbott's ability to continue on a double-digit growth trajectory off of that $5 number, if ok.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. it's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. but we have -- but listen, we didn't do 2021 in isolation. so we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that i talked about. so i can -- i can probably give you some general comments over here. i mean, i think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year and we're going to be looking to build on it. prior to the pandemic, the street consensus for 2023 eps was just under $5. so we're targeting that eps this level this year. so in essence, we've pulled forward at least two full years of eps growth and our mindset here bob is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull forward indefinitely.
we always start our process with a double-digit target every year, that's been our identity, and i have no intention of changing that identity. of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate, but even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that -- on that double-digit.
one of those is obviously covid and covid testing, and even if covid testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there is a significant portion that's still very sustainable. can we predict it perfectly today? no, i can't. not to the level that you are accustomed to get from us, but i also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models.
the pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. and i think the -- i think i've talked about this in the last -- in the last call. i think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, i don't see them going away. on top of that, we -- as i said, we've got investment and investment spending into sg&a. but more specifically into r&d, we believe r&d is the more sustainable spend. it's the -- it's the spend that allows us to sustain our topline growth rate.
so, i would expect that these investments that we've made in q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that would have an impact on our base business growth rate. we've always talked about our base business being sustainable at 7% to 8% and i would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that.
and i guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double-digits in 2022 is, we've got a great balance sheet and we've got a strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. so i lay all of these elements out here, sustained covid testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we will be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt taylor from ubs. your line is open.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thanks a lot for taking the question. so maybe i'll just ask you to drill down a little bit on testing and the assumptions that you have for testing in the year. you came in really strong here in q4 with a big step-up sequentially. what are you assuming in the $5 for testing throughout the year, if you could discuss some of the different product lines. and then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here, then. and then i'll spend time talking a little about sustainability of the testing. as i said, i don't -- i don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. we achieved $2.4 billion in q4, so if you annualize that, it will go, it'll land [phonetic] right around $10 billion. so i can expect probably q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. and if you'd say ok, what does the full year range look like, i probably can't go beyond q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that 6.5% to 7% range, i would think. but we've got as i said, plenty of capacity to go above that.
so that's probably what's incorporated here, matt in the $5. but i think the big -- the big point here is the sustainability of this. and to your question there, i think a good portion is sustainable, i think a substantial portion is sustainable. which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. we started with our lab based systems. those were the -- probably the obvious part in the strategy since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there and you saw that rollout happen.
but we also knew then in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure, you'd have to add faster testing and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was -- that was more affordable, which is why we developed those two lateral flow tests. there's been a lot of visibility to binax here in the u.s.. we haven't talked a lot about panbio, but panbio uses the same -- the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. and we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the united states that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with panbio.
so both of those products, they've been the bulk of our sales, we saw that in q4. there's a lot of capacity that we've built around them and that we continue to build around them. and the clinical utility of them is really strong. i mean, they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. and i think that's a key distinction here as your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of dna of the virus in their system.
so i think it's sustainable, and i think you need to take two kind of views here on that. at least this is how we are looking at it. first of all we need to think globally about this. sometimes we get very focused on the u.s. and what's going on in here in the u.s., but you've got 8 billion plus people around the world, you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. so once you really take a bigger, a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective.
and the second thing that i think is just reframing the testing. i think, we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about q2 and q3 of last year. long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests, that might be not sustainable, not as sustainable. but if you position yourself into 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable tests, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, i think that's the -- that's the sustained kind of business here that we see.
so when you think about that maturing of the covid testing market, we kind of see pcr kind of maturing first and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. and listen, we've built a lot of capacity. as i said, it's probably $12 billion, $13 billion, $14 billion of capacity that we've built in there. we haven't put it all in, but it's there.
and then the other part that i talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. and everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, etc, but it's also seeping [phonetic] the market and it's building these new testing channels. we've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, etc. so we believe that's pretty sustainable too.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for that very detailed answer. maybe i'd just ask a quick follow-up on panbio. that's a big new piece of the story here. i think, you rightly pointed out, it may take longer in some countries for things to improve. so maybe testing last longer there. could you talk specifically about panbio and what you're able to do capacity-wise, or any way to frame that opportunity?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so from a technology perspective, it's the -- it's using the same kind of lateral flow technology that binax has, it's just in a different -- it's just in a different form, and in the cassette [phonetic] format. we've got capacity to do over 50 million tests per month and we've used our infectious disease emerging market organization. so the manufacturing, the regulatory, the r&d and more important, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, etc on rolling out antigen testing internationally.
so i think it's -- i think it's done very well. we've been able to kind of leverage some of the -- some of the kind of joint development of binax and panbio. but the demand that we're seeing internationally, i would characterize also as probably just starting. it hasn't even peaked either. so i think we've got a lot of opportunity with panbio internationally too and i think the teams have done a really good job there.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
all right, thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robbie marcus from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
robert marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
oh, great. i'll add my congratulations on the quarter. maybe i'll ask both my questions as one upfront. this is a significant windfall of cash you're getting from the covid testing in 2020 and 2021 and hopefully beyond, so maybe you could just talk about where you're going to put all that cash to use. i know you've mentioned in the past some of it is going to fund new product launches. if you could just also as part of the answer highlight the key product launches in 2021 and beyond to look for. thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll probably say the following. a lot of it is going toward r&d, robbie, and as i said, i think that's the more sustainable spend. it's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building our r&d programs. yeah, there is opportunity to accelerate sg&a and put in some of that cash to use in sg&a and there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more sg&a and there is -- and there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's libre or nutrition. but a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into r&d. and quite frankly, i think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit under-appreciated, i think. there is a lot of focus that goes in into kind of key three products. you guys like to write them -- write about them as the big three and they get a lot of attention. and quite frankly, they should, whether it's libre, mitraclip and alinity, they're large, multibillion dollar segments that are under penetrated. and we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses.
i'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? so libre, with libre 3, we've got libre 4 in development. we've been making investments in new applications for the libre platform outside of diabetes. in mitraclip obviously we've got this opportunity with the cms reimbursement. we have a fifth generation mitraclip that's also in development. and we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us and we'll continue to do that. probably the one i'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for dmr [phonetic], that we've announced also.
and then in alinity, you also know the story. i mean, we've got six new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. so that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. but i think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. it's so much more than that. on the epd and the nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment.
this is the model that we know drives the returns we need for these businesses, and i think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this, and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. epds rolled out over 50 products, i expect that to continue. nutrition has done over 20, and i expect that to continue also.
in diagnostics, outside of alinity, outside of covid, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. i've been talking about this about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. so, whether it's going beyond covid or flu with rsv strep, we've got a sexual transmitted disease platform for id now which we're excited about, also which i think has got a great opportunity.
and then this rapid concussion test, robbie, i think it's a great opportunity for us. probably the biggest opportunity we have is if once we work through to have a whole blood test, i can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the u.s., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another year and a half or bit or so to get there. but i think it's a great opportunity.
and then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment, the way we have. obviously, tendyne and cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. we've launched tendyne in europe. we are funding our cephea programs that we can have a transfemoral transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. i'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on tendyne. triclip, i've talked about the opportunity with triclip. it's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. and we're still in the early innings here of development of clinical evidence development and we're going to be leading there.
we've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our crm portfolio. we've just started to roll out now more global basis our new two -- our two new defibrillator products under the gallant, and we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual chamber product. i like the program, i like what we've done with it. i think we have a value proposition, a differentiated value proposition versus the competition.
cardiomems is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. if you think about the opportunity we have with cardiomems, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a billion dollar opportunity for us. so that is obviously getting a lot of attention. and then i'm very excited to come into the u.s. with the laa and the tavr product sometime this year. i think these are great opportunities. i like the product that we have, especially on the laa side with amulet. it does very well in europe and we'll be funding those programs too.
so it's more than the big three. there's a lot here, and quite frankly, bob and i are already going to the businesses. he's been saying, ok, what was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process, and can we get going on those too. so that's where a lot of the investment goes, into r&d.
robert marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david lewis from morgan stanley. your line is open.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking the questions. robert, just wanted to follow back up on investment, and i'm just sort of thinking about your balance sheet here relative to peers. you're already more than a turn better than all your large cap peers, and frankly i can see a scenario by 2024 this is a net cash business and a $200 billion market cap company. so you have unprecedented levels of financial leverage on the balance sheet.
in recent weeks, we've actually seen some of your competitors get more aggressive on growth-oriented m&a, and we haven't heard much of that conversation this morning. so what are your thoughts on growth-oriented m&a this year to supplement that pipeline? and should investors be thinking about tuck-in growth-oriented m&a because you certainly have the capacity to do something more transformative. and then i have a quick follow-up.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. on the m&a side, listen, we're always looking, as i've always said, we're always looking, we're always studying. so while we may not be announcing or doing something, we're still studying, we're still looking. and as i said in the previous question though, david, i mean, i think we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in, and i like those organic opportunities.
so they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now, but if you think about m&a, yeah, it's got to be a good fit strategically and it's got aligned with our growth orientation here. i mean, i'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate and obviously is able to generate a return for our shareholders. so there's a lot of activity, there's a lot of -- i'd say, high valuations right now also. but to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios.
so that's probably the better way to put it to you.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, very helpful. and then, you know, what a difference a year makes, we're deep into the call, we haven't talked about libre yet. but i'm kind of curious on two fronts on libre. one, what -- the full commercial rollout of libre 3 in europe, when can we be thinking about the right quarter to think about stepping on the gas with libre 3? is it this quarter, is it next quarter? and then just more broadly, robert, i mean, given the investment spending this year on direct-to-consumer and where that platform could go over time, maybe help us understand what investors may not be appreciating about where that platform can go over a multi-year basis.
so when is the push in europe, and where can that platform go with investment? thanks so much.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sure. so libre gets pushed down to fourth or fifth question. but it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. we had a real strong quarter in q4. we exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the u.s. i think global sales were $750 million, up 35%, and i expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. and usually when that happens, we think, well gee, lot of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down, and i don't think so.
i think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our libre business here. so i kind of look at libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. a lot of focus on the u.s., on the rollout, on libre 2 rollout, we're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. i think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition.
i think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. there's a lot of available third party-audited data, and when i do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them and i tell them, you can't hide behind these -- you know, you can't hide, we're in the pharmacy, like, all this data is available. and i think it's done really well in the u.s.
obviously, i want it to do better, but i can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's nbrxs, trxs, refill rates, etc. one of them that i'm extremely happy to see is the rx fulfillment rate. so when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right, and there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled, it's usually a co-pay.
and what we've seen with the libre rx fulfilment rate is that about nine out of ten get filled, and you compare that to our competitor at about six out of ten, i think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in dtc advertising, we can invest more in this platform, and we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to rx fulfillment rates. so i'd say the focus on u.s. is l2.
your question on l3, you know, we're already here. we've been working through, i'd say, the reimbursement contracting process. it probably got delayed a little bit in q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on covid, but we're all ready. manufacturing is ready, in fact, between libre 2 and libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity, and i think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass market approach that, you know, develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption, and that's working out very well. so we should see a libre 3 launch international in q1. and then in the u.s., we'll issue a release when we get approval.
david lewis -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
lawrence biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really nice year. so two from me, one just on kind of how you see the recovery playing out in 2021, and one on the p&l. so robert, how do you see the year playing out for devices ex-libre and diagnostics, ex-covid testing in terms of the recovery? q1 starts to be an easier comp because we started to see the covid impact last year in the first quarter, and do you see the second half of this year as more normalized? then i have one follow-up.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so on the device side, as i said in the earlier comments here, larry, i think we're going to -- we're looking at what we saw in q3 and correlating that drop in rates, not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures.
a lot of these procedures are lifesaving. some of them are elective, some of them are lifesaving, and we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the u.s. and international really wanting to push stronger, and a sense here that with the vaccine they feel more confident to be able to build it. so i think you'll see -- probably the biggest comp issue, i would say, is probably q2. i mean, i think that's when we saw the big drop. q1 was probably more toward the end of the quarter, the last two weeks of march.
so i kind of see the more normalization growth rates, those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business excluding diabetes to look more like that in -- starting in q3. but we'll have a nice build, i think to there as the year progresses.
lawrence biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then on the p&l, bob, you gave some helpful color on some of the below the line items, but the testing revenue, it comes at a pretty high margin, i believe. how should we be thinking about gross margin and operating margin in '21 relative to 2020?
thanks for taking the questions.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, certainly. so our gross margin on our testing businesses is pretty similar to kind of the base business, maybe a touch higher than that. we saw a steady improvement in the fourth quarter on gross margin from the prior quarter, it was up about 100 basis points, and we saw that kind of steady improvement coming out of the second quarter where we saw the impact of the decline in the medical device area, and -- so third quarter, fourth quarter, steady improvement. and we would expect that to continue to go steadily up as we see recovery in those base businesses. we see more normalization coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume normalizes.
in the fourth quarter, you did also see the impact of some of the investments that we were making in that capacity that robert talked about, and so that was a bit of an offset that you saw come through in the fourth quarter.
lawrence biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joanne wuensch from citi. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good morning everybody and thank you for taking the question. i want to focus on two things. epd saw a really nice recovery in the fourth quarter, but not as strong as it's been the last couple of years. how do you think about that recovering over time? and then the second question is a bit of a big picture question. we're talking a lot with investors about a whole new world and how healthcare is being delivered, and i would think you would be one of the closest to seeing how the pandemic has changed delivery. thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so on epd, yeah, we did see a nice recovery. i mean, when we looked at how the impact of covid progressed geographically, we saw it for some reason kind of trail a little bit the developed markets, whether it was europe and the u.s. we really started to feel the impact on our epd business, which is as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of q2 and then big in q3 as a lot of those countries shut down. and the way the model works is, you still need a prescription and you need your physician, or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. so when we looked at q4, we were actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected, because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses and it came back faster.
at the same time, it's not a nice, kind of a linear forecast in these markets and it does tend to bounce up around. i mean, we had 9%, 10% growth in q1, there was some stocking effect there in february and march in some of the markets. so you'll have a comp over there. but what we look at is we're looking at the ims demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in, and we're seeing a nice recovery. so i expect that just to sequentially get better and, i guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single digit growth rate toward the second half.
oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. i think a lot has happened, right, and we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. one of them i've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. we believed in it, we believed that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the alere acquisition, and this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about two years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we were going to be. so that's an important part for us.
being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that i think is going to be here, and here to say, whether it's a covid test or other tests. i think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side.
and then the other side that i'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and healthcare, and how those devices are being connected. you've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. for neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform which i think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model.
so i'd say, the covid testing accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the two pandemic driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
scott leinenweber -- vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
we'll take one more question, operator.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from vijay kumar from evercore. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. and i'll try to ask both of mine in one question. i guess robert, your pcr plus antigen tests, can they detect these new variants, especially the south african variant? is there a difference one versus the other, pcr versus an antigen, and when you look at the total revenue contribution, my follow-up was the $6.5 billion to $7 billion-ish of covid revenues in fiscal '21, what would be a reasonable baseline modeling assumption for when i look at fiscal '22, is that a 50% drop-off, 75% drop-off? i'm curious how you guys are thinking about it. thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. so i think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. i think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get toward the summer, but i think at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to explore the demand that exists, both in the u.s. and globally. so yeah, i'm not sure right now that you can easily just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon.
regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here, i don't want to get too wonky here, but we've been looking at this, vijay, since the beginning. we have a group of -- we call them the virus hunters, they're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to not only test our existing products, but even the develop of new ones.
and i'd say right now the mutations are happening, the ones that you referenced, the south african one and the u.k. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein, or what we call the s-protein. the rapid antigen tests that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the n-protein, so in silico analysis says no impact. the u.k. nih did a study on panbio and found the u.k. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from u.k., south africa, brazil, etc. and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed.
on the molecular side, whether it's id now, you know, id now looks at a different gene, the rdrp [phonetic] gene, it's a different thing, and similar thing also with the pcr. so i think those are right now from everything we know wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. we're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. [speech overlap]
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's extremely helpful. thank you guys.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
so i feel good about that right now, but obviously we're constantly vigilant here. [speech overlap]. so let me just close here. i'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% eps. we're forecasting 2021 here at least $5, and like i said, i think we've got opportunity to have upside to that, but still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. and in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in r&d to be able to sustain our growth going forward. so we feel confident about maintaining our double-digit in 2022.
a significant portion of our covid testing, we believe is sustainable. we've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that i think will accelerate our growth rate, and some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. so you combine those three elements here, i think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double-digits for 2022. so, thanks.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by abbott. it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission. i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisitions.
scott leinenweber -- vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
good morning and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, president and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we'll take your questions. before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of covid-19 pandemic on abbott's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31st, 2019, and in item 1a risk factors in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended march 31st, 2020. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.
please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, eps and line items of the p&l will be for continuing operations only. on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. today, we reported another highly successful year for abbott during what's been the single most disruptive healthcare event in our lifetimes.
for the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last january when we were expecting a normal economy. performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model.
in normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. it should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our diagnostics business. covid-19 dominated the year for us and the world and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus.
in total, we delivered more than 400 million covid tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. but as we discussed before, the year was not all diagnostics and covid. our more consumer facing businesses; nutrition, diabetes care and established pharmaceuticals, all contributed growth for the year. and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. i'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment.
we exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings-per-share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. turning to 2021, we're forecasting another year of top tier performance. as we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021 reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. and because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic eps in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment.
i'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to bob. and i'll start with nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. strong growth of ensure, our market leading complete and balanced nutrition brand and glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand led to double-digit growth in adult nutrition for both the quarter and full year. in pediatric nutrition, u.s. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of similac, our market leading infant formula brand. international pediatric nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in greater china.
during the past year, we continue to expand our nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extension including; the continued rollout of infant formula products across our similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharides or hmo which supports a healthy immune system, global expansion of our pediasure, glucerna and ensure brands including the continued rollout of ensure high protein products and the launch of four new pedialyte rehydration products; pedialyte zero sugar, sport, organic and immune support.
for 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. turning to medical devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. strong double-digit growth in diabetes care was offset by lower sales in our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as covid case rate surge in certain geographies toward the end of the quarter.
as we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as covid case rate subside. in diabetes care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year led by freestyle libre, our market leading continuous glucose monitoring system. in the u.s., libre sales grew 50% last year and outside the u.s., libre sales grew 40% surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year of 2020.
this past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our medical device portfolio. let me touch on a handful. first, the approval of mitraclip g4, the latest generation of our market leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. just last week in the u.s., medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for mitraclip which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. ce mark of tendyne, a first of its kind, minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve and the ce mark of triclip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. long considered the forgotten valve, triclip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for three valves in the heart; the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves.
we also launched two cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our gallant brand that include bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. also saw the approval of ensite x, our next generation 3d cardiac mapping technology and u.s. approval of freestyle libre 2 and ce mark for libre 3, the latest generations of our market leading continuous glucose monitoring systems. and ce mark of libre sense glucose sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensors technology into mass market opportunities beyond diabetes.
as you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline and quite frankly, there is even more i could highlight. in 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our diabetes care business led by freestyle libre and steady improvements in our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses fueled by the continued business recovery as society works its way through covid-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches.
moving to established pharmaceuticals or epd where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. despite covid, epd sales increased 2% overall in 2020 demonstrating the resilience of our business model, even in this challenging environment. growth this past year was led by sales in india, russia, china and brazil.
during the year, epd continue to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. as we've discussed before, new product introductions in epd are more incremental in nature and a steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. we forecast demand and growth rate improvements in epd during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth.
and i'll wrap up with our diagnostic business where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter driven by $2.4 billion of covid testing related sales. we realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. with that understanding, starting last march, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. the biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes binaxnow in the u.s. and panbio internationally.
these are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 15 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, work place settings and even at home. as part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these test, called navica
which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices.
but our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. we also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than $100 million of these two test combined per month. while our covid testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we will also remain focused on the launch and rollout of alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. we continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. and we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments.
last year, we initiated the u.s. launch of alinity m for molecular testing. this launch included a covid test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. and earlier this month, we announced the u.s. fda clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. this test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produces results within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-stat alinity handheld device.
building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under fda breakthrough designation and our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. so in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the eps range we set last january before anyone knew the extent of the covid pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution.
our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering ground-breaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products with more on the horizon. we continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for covid, which is helping to fight the virus and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy, and we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted eps growth in 2021 which is truly unique in this environment.
i'll now turn over the call to bob. bob?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis. turning to our results. sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in nutrition and diabetes care along with global covid testing related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter.
foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations, had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in october. reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. regarding other aspects of the p&l, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales, r&d investment was 6% of sales and sg&a expense was 23.5% of sales.
our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full-year effective tax rate of 15%. this is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in october due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. we forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, non-operating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. congratulations on such a strong q1 revenue and profit growth. i think i can recall the last time, the company put up a 100% earnings growth. so impressive there. i guess, i'd love to hear your thoughts on two important topics, robert if you don't mind. and the first topic is binaxnow otc. i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. so that's the first topic. and then, i'll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time.
the second topic is a little bit longer term oriented, because last quarter you expressed some confidence in abbott's ability to drive double digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year. and the question i would have is, based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed with your views. and i think investors would also love to hear, if you assume more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double digit earnings growth next year. so just want to list all upfront there and thanks for taking the questions.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thanks. on your first question regarding kind of the -- the us binaxnow otc launch. so yeah, we're very excited about that. we see this as a significant opportunity and quite frankly a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the us, which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment where consumers and people can get the results at a -- at much faster rate. and quite frankly with a little bit of less -- less hassle, less -- less process. so we see this as a significant opportunity. it's easy. it's affordable. and i think that's a key part here, bob, as you think about surveillance testing and serial testing, it needs to -- it needs to contemplate those two areas, right? it needs to be affordable.
it's difficult to do serial testing on pcr when you -- you've got a cost of $100 plus and takes between two days to three days to get that. so i think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. i think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes, think of it as maybe your new -- your new element in your medicine cabinet. but we've been seeing this shift happen toward the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here this move toward -- toward rapid.
specifically in the us, we've got a great position, as a lot of this otc is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment and the retail channel, and those are capabilities that as you know, through our nutrition business, through our diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there. so -- so we're excited. and i think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing.
a key aspect of that is obviously scale. we have to have scale to be able to meet -- to be able to meet the demand. and quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of -- in terms of production. we've got an -- an established capacity this quarter now that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms. so we feel very good about that position. we feel good about this opportunity.
to your second question on 2022. yeah, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in january and we commented on our call and to be honest, nothing has changed on that front, nothing has changed over the last 90 days. we start our planning process every year. we target double digit growth. and we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digits in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, covid testing, new product launches, investment spend, etc. none of that has changed. i mean, if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. we grew double digits, as i said in my prepared remarks in core lab and molecular diagnostics, excluding covid. libre is growing rapidly. nutrition and epd are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. we've got momentum with a lot of our product launches, mitraclip g4, triclip, i'd say, our mapping systems, our new crm devices.
and then, we've got coming out of this year, going into next year four key product launches that we feel very, very good about, very excited about then given -- given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. and you know those are laa -- entering the laa market here in the us, potential expansion of indication for cardiomems entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber entering the us tavr market.
i mean, all four of those opportunities are multi-billion dollar segments and -- and we've been working hard at the last call it 18 months to get us ready to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. so the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes, if anything, this acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. and we continue to believe, a good portion of the covid testing is sustainable. there is -- as i said, there is a clear trend here to move toward rapid formats. we're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. so wherever that -- wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure.
so you look at all these different components here, bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. the one thing, i'll say is that as you look at all of these different businesses that probably one thing that we can try and model now, but it will probably be different january is just how the mix of those businesses are going to -- are going to contribute to that double digit growth. it always ends up differently in terms of how we planned. we did double digit in 2020, and it was very different versus how we set it up in january of 2020.
so if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. if there is any caution here, i guess, for next year, it would already be seem to be priced here into our pe. so -- but that being said, i don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. we still feel good about our double digit.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
that's great. thank you. and then, just if there was a more conservative testing environment, how does that impact or what you think about things?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
i mean that's -- i guess that's the -- that's the model here, where we start to model different ways, different parts of all these elements that i explained to you and it's going to be difficult. i'm not going to put out an assumption there of what covid testing level is required. but i do feel that a good portion of it is going to be sustainable. and we'll get a lot of the share of the covid testing that's remain, so...
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robbie marcus from jp morgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
great. and i'll echo bob's congratulations on a very nice quarter. maybe just a follow-up. robert, i'd love to get a sense, one of the key investor topics, as you just touched on is the double digit target for eps growth next year. and part of that, it looks like you're front-loading a lot of expenses into 2021 here, you grew opex about $300 million versus last year. so i'd love to see if i could just get a little more meat on the bones in terms of the road map to that double digit eps more down the p&l versus the top line, which you just talked about. and does it imply sort of high 20s operating margins to get there? thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
on the high 20s operating margin, yeah, that does to be the case. regarding the areas of investment, i mean, we -- i talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. i'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these costs -- these covid testing profits into the r&d portion of the p&l. we believe that is a very sustainable investment. and if i look across all the businesses in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in r&ds, and we've got clear programs across all of them to build the r&d programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24.
a lot of the products that i just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter -- two quarters or three quarters, plus the four key areas that we're -- we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth and those are already been funded. but i'd say the investments here really looking into next generation products in diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio in devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24.
on the sg&a side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. i'd say probably a lot of the sg&a is going toward libre and driving -- and driving libre awareness and growth, both in the us and international markets, and you'll start to see that ramp up even more, as we go throughout the year both in terms of the spend and the return on the top line.
we're making investments also in nutrition to strengthen our brands and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market and expanding footprint in several of our device businesses, where we know that clinical specialist and sales force, etc is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
great. really helpful. and maybe just a quick follow-up. we're all really interested to hear not just about how the devices business did in the first quarter, but really the forward commentary on what you're seeing exiting march and into april here. so if you have any early feedback on the exit rates? and what you're expecting in terms of catch-up that would be really helpful? thanks a lot.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think -- as i said in my prepared comments and on the first question too, i mean, we saw a nice recovery. obviously -- there was obviously some -- little bit of a slowdown in january. so we had a nice pickup, i'd say in october, november, where -- sorry, yeah, october, november, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. and i'd say december, january saw that -- saw that decline as the cases increase. but saw a real nice progression in the month of february and then very strong growth in march.
and rob, what we try to do also is, we try to look at this -- the march is a tricky month because you've got those two weeks of last year, where things kind of really kind of shutdown. so we look at march not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus march of 2019. and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. and we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019 -- in q1 of 2019. so i think we saw a real nice growth. in core lab, that was very positive to see. we saw double digit growth there and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there.
our molecular diagnostic business excluding covid and pcr covid testing was up 30%. so that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the alinity m to launch into the market with covid, and then kind of build off the menus also having a positive impact over there too. so i'd say very good exit rate. and as we look at the first two weeks of april and we look at it every -- every week here, real nice progression. so i didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. i actually saw continued nice improvement in structural heart, in ep and even in crm. so those are -- that's a nice trend, as we're going into the second quarter too.
and we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in europe. i'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was europe, given all the shutdowns there. but again, i'd say the first couple of weeks in europe are looking pretty good.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's great to hear. i appreciate the color. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question. robert, one for me on capital allocation, and one on your favorite topic, i think libre. so a lot of questions around 2022. and my question is, how important is it to hit that double digit eps growth target in 2022 and your thoughts around capital allocation helping you achieve the 5.50 [phonetic] in eps is a buyback or an accretive deal something you would consider to get there. and i had one follow-up on libre?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, we start every year, as i said, targeting double digit. if you look at where we are in 2021 versus 2019, we're up 53%, but we'll be targeting, as i said, double digit in 2022. and again, there is multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, etc. we do have a strong balance sheet and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. we try and have a balanced approach there, larry, in terms of balancing between short and the long term, investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. so whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. it's an important part of our identity.
on the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. we could be looking to do a little bit more than going -- in this year, going into next year. and then from an m&a perspective, i'd say, we're always actively monitoring. we're always actively looking. and you'll always hear me say that i'm not going to -- i'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. but if there is something that is attractive, something that has got growth that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which i think is best-in-class or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested.
but we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external, and this is not a -- this is not a kind of new ceo versus prior ceo philosophy. this is always been -- this has always been an abbott philosophy. we're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that i just described.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then, libre, how should we think about the growth for the remainder of the year, the comps get a little easier, you talked about 40%, it's an aspirational goal in the last call. and just, what's the latest on the libre 3 launch in europe. and if you'll give us any color on the us, it would be certainly appreciated. but i'm not sure we'll get it today, but thank you for taking the questions.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i did put out a goal of growing 40% in 2021. you mentioned comparison, yeah, there is a little bit of a -- there is a little bit of a -- you've got a bit of a balance here between q1 and q2. so q1 last year, we saw some stocking up in international and in the us. so i look at our 30% here and on top of a pretty strong quarter last year has really -- really positive momentum. we'll have some effect of -- on the reverse side of that in q2. so then it becomes really a second half. can we kind of sustain this kind of mid 30s and accelerated into the 40s in the second half. and the answer is, we believe so.
we've got great portfolio. we've got great momentum and making the investments, whether its field force, whether it's direct consumer advertising not just in the us, but around the world significant investments to building awareness for the category. i mean, we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. that's -- that's three -- we could say, hey, that's three times our next competitor. but the reality is, the penetration for us and for the category is still pretty significant. so there is plenty of room here for us to invest and grow. and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also r&d.
your question on libre 3 that's -- we launched that into europe at the end of this quarter. we're right where we want to be. we start off usually small and focused here, larry. we learn -- we learn with the consumer. we learn with the hcp in terms of what resonates. we learn with our manufacturing. we've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. but there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. it is a new platform. and we learn with insurance and insurance switches over and all those things. and once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. but i've got -- we got a lot of strategic flexibility here with libre 2 and libre 3. i think it's -- i think we're in a great position.
feedback has been really good. i mean, we have launched this with about over 1,000 hcps. we've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just try to see what their reactions are with the products and it's been extremely positive. there's a lot of social media there. i'm not very fluent in german. but i can tell the facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it.
so i think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension, size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, where experience all that. it's all great. it's all good. so regarding your question on libre timeframe, i think you answered it. so that's good. we're not going to -- i'm not going to provide any details here. but i'm just really excited about libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio having both 2 and 3, i just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys, congrats on the [indecipherable]. thanks for taking my question. robert, i did want to ask you on fiscal '21. if i look at q1 excluding contribution from covid right, the base business, it looks like it was up 10% organic versus pre-pandemic '19 levels. one, is that math correct? and if we're starting off at 10%, i guess, are we looking at perhaps teens kind of growth for fiscal '21 on the top line on the base business?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief finance officer
hi, vijay, this is bob. yeah. your math is spot on. our first quarter was up over 2019 by around 10%. so we had really good -- really good performance in the quarter in the base business, and you really saw that across kind of the portfolio of businesses. and then, we would expect to continue to see strong growth during the course of the rest of the year in particular, as medical device procedures continue to improve. and we would expect to see kind of that base business growth in the mid teens.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, guys. and then, one on the [indecipherable] testing side. i saw the press release yesterday launching the asymptomatic consumer version of the product. what -- i guess, how are revenues recognized. is this recognized on shipment. and what are early -- what is early demand looking like from the retailers like cvs and wal -- walgreens -- walmart. and is there expectation of 6.5 billion to 7 billion for fiscal '21, is that unchanged. thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so on the 6.5 to 7, yeah, that remains unchanged. it's difficult to forecast here in that tight range that you'd expect from abbott. but yeah, we continue to forecast sales at around -- at around that level. regarding your question, i think it was regarding the binaxnow otc in the us, correct. is that what you're referring to?
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
correct.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so yeah, i mean we -- we received approval for the product several weeks ago, and we immediately started our manufacturing process. it is a different presentation from the previous binax test in which we provide two tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. so we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers, and we'll start with cvs, walgreens, walmart, and you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, etc to roll into that, as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. so yeah, we ship the product and the revenue is booked when the -- when the asset is transferred over to the retailer.
but i think this is going to be a -- as i said, a great opportunity. it's a channel we know very well. i think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to -- it's kind of really compete. so we feel very good about our position, and we'll start. we start off with the initial stocking orders and then, from then we'll roll out more distribution. and we expect given the price point here, vijay, that there is going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the us to be able to have testing on hand ready to go at their house. so we expect that there will be a nice repeat purchase also.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
you know, bob, i'm planning on stocking up, robert. thanks you for the comments.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for that.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matt miksic from credit suisse. your line is open.
matt miksic -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, just a quick question from me if i could, it is just on some of the pipeline opportunities around amulet and cardiomems and portico, if you could provide us with maybe an update on those programs? and secondly, on just the progression of mitraclip. this has been a device and procedure that was a little bit more impacted by the slowdown over the winter. and just love to get a sense of what the trajectory looks like now heading into q2? thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
so a couple there. so on the amulet side, yeah, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the united states in the international markets and the product does very well. we filed with the fda late last year. we think this is a very attractive market. it's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. and as i said, i think, amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. we're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those r&d investments i mentioned in next generations there also, but even in its current format performs very well. and we've got a great experience in europe.
we believe a lot in this market, in this segment. and so we've also initiated our catalyst trial. so we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing amulet to noac drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with af that are at risk of a stroke. so we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also results there will take a bit longer to divulge. those are probably in the 2023 timeframe. but it just shows our commitment to this segment, because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, pipeline and it's a great segment here.
so i think you had another question on mitraclip. mitraclip did very well in the quarter. obviously, it got impacted by covid last year. it was on a great trajectory and kind of got slowed down, as obviously the icu beds and hospitals move toward treating covid. but we had great growth in q1. we're up in the mid teens in the us. so that was good. as i said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of march and that wasn't just catch up because i've looked at the procedures in the first two weeks of april and they continue to move up. so that's very positive for us.
and we're making our investments not only on the pipeline side, new versions of mitraclip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists on our implanting center. so that's done very well.
and i think the ncd that got approved in january opens up a significant opportunity for us with mitraclip. remember, we're only -- we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. and i think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitra space.
and i think you also had a question on cardiomems. we expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. this would also significantly broaden the us market opportunity. and we plan to pursue cms reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. this segment continues to grow. our q1 growth in cardiomems was north of 20% and that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and i like the position we have in them.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt taylor from ubs. your line is open.
matt taylor -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking the question. so i wanted to go back to the idea of the double digit growth and the investments that you're making this year, you called out r&d, and we've seen dtc has been stepping up, i think there is a lot of libre commercials there now. i guess, my question is, when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically we thought about abbott is driving 7% growth that was your algorithm pre-covid. do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable higher post-covid organic growth? and then, how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i'd say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-covid, and i'd say with these investments that we're making excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we'll probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range. i mean, once you factor in, maybe a q1 comparison on the base business next year probably growing a little bit higher than that, matt. but at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at with all these investments and product development and portfolio development.
as i said, a big portion of our covid cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. and we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. i mean, i'd probably say that each business has their list of go to areas that we've all agreed to, our kind of next steps if we have more opportunity to invest in the business. we know exactly -- we know exactly, where to go.
as it relates to toggling down, yeah, i mean, i wouldn't be togging down r&d. i think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. it's easier to toggle on sg&a and we've got that capabilities also if we need to.
matt taylor -- ubs -- analyst
great. and i just had a follow-up on diagnostics. the underlying growth, as you called out in core lab and molecular was impressive. and i'm wondering if we're going to see you get increased momentum in the underlying business because of your success with covid diagnostics. do you think you can leverage that larger installed base and drive to higher growth in the core diagnostic business over time now?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the answer to that is yes. we've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and idns and institutions, as it relates to their kind of covid testing. there has been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. so the answer to that is, yeah. on the core lab, for sure you saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out.
in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't -- we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business excluding covid in a very long time, and we're up close to 30% excluding covid testing. a lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull through on the other assays on the other tests.
so on the rapid side too, i wouldn't just look at it from a core lab perspective. the sustainability of covid is one -- one portion of it is the actual covid test, the other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing, as a result of that. i talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just covid and covid is allowing us to do that.
but if you think about for example, our id now instrument, where we basically exceeded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in a world outside of covid by making -- by placing these instruments. we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the us in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. so we almost quadrupled our installed base there. and will they all be as productive from a covid testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic? one years, two years out, no, probably not. but they will be very productive with all of our other assays and that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us.
so to answer your question, yeah, i do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our alinity platform on the core lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business.
matt taylor -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks, rob.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joanne wuensch from citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citibank -- analyst
thank you very much for taking the questions. just putting both upfront. can you give us an idea of how you're thinking about revenue for the remainder of the year, particularly, i'm going to get questions about covid-19 diagnostic revenue in 2021?
and then, my second question has to do with the other areas of med tech that are starting to support or continue to support that high single digit growth rate. anything you can add color on neuromod, vascular, crm would be helpful? thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it is we'll see our -- let's call it non-covid diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow, obviously, you'll have comps, so with that, joanne, in q2 and q3. that will be producing some mid teens kind of growth numbers in this business. but i think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here is we're always looking at it on a two year cagr. so if we get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our core lab business that on a two year cagr that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers.
covid testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. i can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. i think the range that we've given last call, i continue to reiterate it, but it's going to be a bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the -- in terms of the covid testing. what i will say though is that i do continue to believe that the shift from lab based pcr still play a role in covid. but i think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing, as it relates to surveillance. and as i said, i think we're well positioned there.
i think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. i'd say listen, i'm very pleased with the crm. i'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great -- it's a great progression that we're seeing here. the launch of our icds and crt-ds with the gallant brand with bluetooth capability in europe and us, all of the numbers show that we're picking up share and that's the ultimate measure here. and i'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment next year with our product and the capabilities that and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. so i think that's done very well.
i'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover, a lot of those procedures require some icu stays. so i think that ones -- was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. i'd say, our share is pretty high around the mid 80s, 85%. so that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. but i think that the cardiomems is another great opportunity for us, where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. so i don't know if that covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on.
joanne wuensch -- citibank -- analyst
if you could hit on [indecipherable] that would be great and then -- thank you.
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief finance officer
yeah. so we did see a little bit of a slowdown in trials toward the end of the year and the beginning of the year and we saw that start to pick up a little bit now. we think that we like our position. we recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the neurosphere. i think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service to patients and the physicians better with that. so we started to roll it out in the us. i think it applies to both scs and dbs too. we've gotten great feedback on that. so i think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro, not only as we lap the comps, but also as the neurosphere gets widely used. and then, we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching toward the end of the year here.
joanne wuensch -- citibank -- analyst
thank you very much.
scott michael leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
operator, we'll take one more question.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from josh jennings from cowen. your line is open.
josh jennings -- cowen -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. i wanted to, rob, just ask about your commentary about the potential to pursue m&a to support that -- that if need be to support the double digit earnings growth in 2022. and anything you can provide investors or analysts with in terms of the areas of focus. i mean, should we be thinking that each business unit could receive some support with the acquisition.
i mean, specifically on medical devices, just follow-up to joanne's question, which we should be thinking about potential the bolstering heart failure, vascular neuromod and some of the software businesses here. i mean, you have such a pipeline and had such success with internal development initiatives, it is an medical device scenario that where you could add.
and then, lastly, just on -- just the structural heart business. i mean in the us, you're going to be amulet and portico in the near term and just how you're thinking about that you did mention the specialized sales force, which we would be thinking about individual sales teams for mitraclip, tavr and left atrial appendage occlusion and how could that all shape out? thanks for taking the questions.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think on the m&a side, you'll hear me say the same thing, which is i think, it always starts off strategically does the business that we're looking at have a strategic fit to abbott both from a market position, from a financial standpoint. so we wouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't fit us strategically just to fill an eps. we want -- we want businesses that we can grow, that we can -- that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company. so i think it always starts like that. it's always starts with the strategic fit.
and then, if it's attractive if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. i think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. so we look at all those areas that you mentioned. we look at diagnostics. we look at all the areas. we're always studying. and we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. so i just wouldn't -- i just wouldn't i tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here so.
regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. but we tend to have a viewpoint here josh, where we believe that kind of focus and dedicated team has always been best. that's kind of how we've run our businesses. it's how we run our businesses for many, many decades. we don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the -- just for the -- just for the sake of synergies. if we believe we're in growth areas, in growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. and quite frankly all the businesses that you talked about in structural heart are areas of high potential growth. so we'll treat them and resource them as such.
so i'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year, that's after 13% growth in 2020, and we feel very good about our first quarter. we feel that our first quarter puts us on track to -- to achieve those -- at least those $5. we have multiple ways to get there. the covid market is going to move more and more toward rapid. and our position in this segment of covid testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, etc. and we believe a good portion of those tests -- of that covid testing market will remain at least into 2022.
and i'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business abbott or let's call it the non-covid side of our business, and we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond and we talked about this also. so we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year.
scott michael leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
very good. thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. this now concludes abbott's conference call. a webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 am central time today on abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. thank you for joining us today.

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] this call is being recorded by abbott, with the exception of any participant questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by abbott. it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission.
i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations licensing and acquisitions.
scott michael leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, president and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we'll take your questions.
before we get started some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31st, 2020. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements, as a result of subsequent events or development, except as required by law.
please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, eps and line items of the p&l will be for continuing operations only. on today's conference call as in the past non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. unless otherwise noted our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today we reported the results of a very strong quarter. ongoing earnings per share were $1.32 reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.
at the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter we're right on track with those expectations. our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.
our strong first quarter will comprised of several factors including global covid testing related sales of $2.2 billion with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales. strong sales growth across all four of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth excluding covid testing related sales of nearly 6%. growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in r&d and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.
i'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to bob. and i'll start with nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. performance was led by our adult nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. the pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically, to our market leading ensure and glucerna brands.
pediatric nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter in place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. our sales growth of this quarter in pediatric nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. in the us and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.
in diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of covid-19 tests, as well as improvement in the base business. as i mentioned earlier, strong covid testing related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, id now, binaxnow, and panbio, as we continue to see demand shift toward rapid testing worldwide. during the quarter, binaxnow received us emergency use authorization for over-the-counter non prescription self use for people with or without symptoms. we began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday.
just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued roll out of our alinity platforms. excluding covid testing related sales, our core lab and molecular diagnostic businesses, both achieved double digit sales growth in the quarter.
turning to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter. it was particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. performance in the quarter was led by double digit sales growth in india, china and brazil. and while we continue to see elevated covid case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.
and lastly, i'll cover medical devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in structural heart, rhythm management, electrophysiology and diabetes care. although, procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [indecipherable] case rates in certain countries, including the us. we saw growth improved throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum.
on average in march, us procedure levels were up mid single digits compared to pre-covid baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher. in structural heart, sales were up mid teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio including mitraclip, triclip, portico and others.
mitraclip sales grew more than 15% in the us, where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of march. in january, cms expanded reimbursement coverage for mitraclip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market leading device.
and i'll wrap up with diabetes care, where growth was led by freestyle libre sales of nearly $830 million. the global user base for libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts, as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.
so in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. all four of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. we're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products, and we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% eps growth as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year.
and i'll turn over the call to bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. bob?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief finance officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
turning to our results. sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses along with strong global covid testing related sales. organic sales growth was balanced with 34% growth in the us and 32% growth internationally. covid testing related sales were also balanced geographically with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.
foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. during the quarter, we saw the us dollar strengthened somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in january. based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales. regarding other aspects of the p&l for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted r&d investment was 6% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense was 25.1% of sales.
as robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in r&d and sg&a to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. during the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with abbvie
for the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million, non-operating income was $73 million, and our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you, and good morning. i'll keep my questions quick and high level. first for robert. i'm just curious on your view on the pace of the recovery in surgical procedures generally. is it kind of continued throughout the quarter and into july or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variance could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? just wanted to get your views on how things are going.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. i mean, we had planned to see that recovery in the u.s. and in europe, in certain asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. i'd say, probably a little bit better even than what we thought.
i don't think what you're seeing here with relating to like increase in covid cases. i don't think that you'll see the same -- at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, etc. i think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year. even though, if you look at the case -- global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were october last year. we've got therapeutics, we've got vaccines, we've got testing. so we're not seeing that.
on the device side, listen, our business has done very well overall. as i said in my comments, we're up double-digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter 2019, largely driven by ep, heart failure, structural heart, diabetes, as i said. and our -- and actually if you look at the cardiovascular specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus march of 2019. and then if you look at the second quarter, our june growth rate was around about 7% versus june of 2019. so we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures.
and we're looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of july are showing that same trajectory whether it's in the u.s. and/or whether it's outside the u.s. generally. obviously there are some markets that have different kinds of trends and paces. but i'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. and that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. thank you. and then my second question for bob. i'd love you to comment on two things, if ok. one is just you had a nice eps beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys were describing the quarter, but your leading guidance is same. i just wanted to understand that dynamic. why not boost the eps a little bit?
and then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit or kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now, obviously, i'm specifically talking about next year. so any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? and wondering just about the eps guidance for this year. thank you.
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, bob. i'll take the first question on the guidance for this year. clearly, about a third of that beat was due to a little higher covid sales than we had projected. obviously, forecasting covid is quite challenging. and so that was about a third of the beat. about two-third really was better performance in the base business versus how the street had modeled that. and so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at -- beginning of june. and that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the covid testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. so we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around covid testing.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, i mean i think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. obviously, from a top-line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our covid sales that we had in q3 and q4. obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp up in covid sales. but the underlying business, excluding covid sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. so we're looking at our base underlying business growing low-double-digits for the rest of the year.
from a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in q2. there is obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, etc. the team works hard to kind of offset those. so we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. and we'll continue to make the ramp up of investments that we talked about from an r&d and sg&a perspective.
some of those investments have a faster and more, i'd say, kind of more immediate return. so for example, direct consumer advertising in nutrition or libre, for example. and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's r&d programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches. so the real, i'd say, kind of factor here becomes covid testing. and we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. after the two quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. so we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next six months.
and i think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year? whether it's variance, whether it's vaccination rates, etc. so that's just something that we're paying attention. and as bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is believed to account for that.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robbie marcus from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a good quarter. bob, maybe to follow-up on the last question, there is a lot of moving pieces down the p&l. right now, you had a really good operating margin in the quarter. i was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of covid testing revenues? how that's flowing through the p&l? and if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
in terms of investment, robbie, if you look at our sg&a and r&d combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year, and we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. so we haven't, as you know, reinvested some of those covid testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward. as you say, we had really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. we're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step down in those covid testing sales in the back half of this year. that's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment in particular in the r&d and sg&a spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and maybe just a quick follow-up. we have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets, we have two interesting ones coming at esc later in august with cardiomems and with amulet. i was just hoping if we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches given the covid environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. on amulet, we talked about this right, robbie? we've filed with the fda late last year. right now we plan to present the data at esc. so that's kind of in the late august timeframe. we think it's again an attractive market. great opportunity for growth for us. the product is available in europe, in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the u.s. we have a 50% market share. so we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have.
regarding timing, it's one of those -- i can't give you an exact timing. it's definitely, we think a kind of in this second half. and then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year, obviously, the impact next year is larger, and that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. obviously, if it's more toward the back end of the year then we'll see a less of an impact. if it's sooner, there will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.
on cardiomems, i guess, similar. we think this is another great opportunity. i mean, both these products were products -- when we began the st. jude integration, both these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and drive the clinical evidence of these two products. so it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together.
we filed our label expansion with the fda on cardiomems this second quarter, more toward the end of the second quarter. and again, we think it's a great opportunity also. and probably, in terms of an approval there, i'm not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open. please check that you're not on mute.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. apologies. congrats on this strong print this morning. robert, maybe one high level question on the base business here. i think there was some confusion this morning on the base ex-covid rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. i think, you did 11% in 2q and that was maybe perhaps low-double-digits in q1. so the question i think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is the 11% versus 10% that seems a little light, but i think that kind of ignores the business mix. maybe perhaps, can you talk about what's happening to device business? what was the sequential acceleration? and what is baked in for back half? should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think the med device kind of grew -- again, q2 versus 2021, that growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as i said in the first question. obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. so if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in neuromodulation where i'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. and we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a structural heart, an ep or a diabetes business.
similar to diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business that's growing high-single-digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter 2019 and that's an improvement versus where we were in q1. one of the issues that we see in our diagnostics business is, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations, and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. so kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostics side, seeing a bit of slower recovery. but i'd say, those businesses that were more impacted by covid in q2 last year, i'd say, they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe one on the product side, on the cardiomems. we did some work. it looks like it's an interesting trial. it's a pretty large trial, i think 3,600 patients enrolled. that's fairly large. i guess, assuming some of these results if they were to mimic champion, the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, i think mortality is an endpoint here. should cardiomems be a multi-billion dollar product for abbott? and the reason i'm asking is, historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism. so i'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer term opportunity?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. i think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. and when we looked at cardiomems at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in cms, certainly the max kind of work reimbursing, etc. and you had positive champion's data, i'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there was also plenty of real world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in champion.
so we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. we believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of champion and/or augment the dataset. so i'm hesitant to put a number around here, vijay, but i think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our heart failure portfolio together with our lvad portfolio and even with mitraclip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it.
and i think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. we think the opportunity to expand the label to a class 2 and a class 4 presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include cardiomems with elevated levels of bnp. so i think that this is a great opportunity.
i guess, your comment on mortality, i think that's important. but i also know in talking to health systems that hospitalization and reduction of hospitalization is still is very important. some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. but i think that if you look at and have conversation with the healthcare systems, they'll see this is an important reduction. any reduction in hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. so bottom line, yeah, i think this is a great opportunity for us. and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger.

that's helpful. thanks, guys.

thank you. our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question. just two for me, i'll start with libre. robert, just maybe at a high level your thoughts on kind of the roadmap for libre from here given that you're closing in on $1 billion a quarter in sales? and more specifically, any update on the launch of libre 3 in europe? and how delays at fda might impact the timing of libre 3 in the u.s.? and i had one follow-up.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw and as you mentioned, approaching at $1 billion mark on a quarterly run rate -- on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. i think really important here, larry, is the user base. and this is a different kind of device business. it's a different -- we've talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little more, i'd say, call it nichey versus the size of libre. but the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80 and 90% plus globally.
it really looks more like a subscription like model. and when you're in that subscription like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. and i think that's a lot of our focus right here as we talked about this mass market is building the user base, and i think we've done a really good job internationally and in the u.s. but as we've talked about, ok, we've got 3.5 million users. i've talked about numbers only up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, etc. so i think there is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings.
as i've said, from a roadmap perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. so that's all gone very well and that will continue to go very well.
libre 3, we launched it in, i'd say, in germany at the beginning of the year here. a lot of our focus in that launch, larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how others -- users from other cgms kind of reacted to it. and it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. and so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of libre 3 where we've got approval.
specifically in the u.s., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the fda regarding diabetes products. and i'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring libre 3 to the u.s. also and augment our portfolio with the product.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's helpful, robert. and just lastly for me. i know i've asked about this on a few earnings calls, but i'm just curious how your thoughts on capital allocation are evolving given your strong balance sheet? we know valuations are relatively high, are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? and historically, the sweet spot for abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range, is that still the case? i mean, obviously st. jude was an exception to that. but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on m&a? thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
well, specific to m&a, there is no change in thoughts there. i mean, i think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about, does it strategically fit, do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it, and that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of a dollar amount there? we're obviously actively looking. we constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. what i can't say is that we've been probably actively monitoring much more than where we were back in 2017. but there are some pretty elevated valuations right now and i'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, etc. and key driver here is it being strategic.
i actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was, we got a lot of opportunity internally. a lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of -- manufacturing kind of ramp up in capacity whether it's libre, whether it's mitraclip, seeing an opportunity here with adult nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in nutrition. so i think we've got great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, robert.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt taylor from ubs. your line is open.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking the question. so i just want to ask one about covid testing, and we know your guidance for the year implies lower sales in the last two quarters. i was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing, especially outside of the u.s. where we have less visibility so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about covid testing here, and i don't think over the last 30 days we've seen anything materially different. i would say, we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the u.s. whether it's pcr, but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. we did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side, but we did see higher international sales, and i'd say, yes, probably driven by delta variant.
a lot of those international sales are more, i'd say, kind of tender-driven. and we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets as a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. and all i could say is we've become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing.
so the question here is going to be even with surges, are you going to see testing increase. i think we will. i think we will see some of that. the question will be geographically where we're going to see it more. and i think geographically, we'll see more internationally than at least what i think right now than what we'll see in the united states from a back half perspective.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. and maybe i could just ask one follow-up on recovery in diagnostics versus med tech. so i know you called out this issue with blood donations. and i guess, excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business ex-covid similar to med techs should go in lockstep or is there going to be a difference there for some reason? could you flesh out the blood donation headwind? how much is that?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. at a high level, i would say, yeah. we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend again within its own kind of segment. our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high-single-digits in q2 versus q2 of 2019. so we are seeing that recovery on the core lab.
there are some assays that haven't recovered as much. what we've seen here in the u.s. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. so when you're doing that you're getting a little bit less of that. but i'd say, that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of alinity. so we're seeing that kind of high-single-digit.
and as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business which we've got 65%, 60% plus market share. so we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because obviously there is inventory of blood, but if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the u.s. so hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get toward the end of the year.
matthew taylor -- ubs -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joanne wuensch from citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi research -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking the question. it's really two questions. the first one is the follow-up on what bob was asking earlier on. is there anything that you can give us on 2022? i'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, covid, double-digit eps. so anything on a framework basis that would be helpful. i'd appreciate it.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and i just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there is so many different kinds of moving parts. we're starting our process right now, but i don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding covid testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top-line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. so our underlying base business will clearly be setup for very strong top and bottom line growth.
we've obviously got to look at covid testing, and that's a factor here. we talked about it last call. it will be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of covid testing. now if there is going to be demand of covid testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. as i said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in q3 and q4 of this year. we've obviously had a real strong q1 also. so that obviously has an impact.
and then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. so we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity. and i want to make sure that i capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon.
joanne wuensch -- citi research -- analyst
thanks. and then i've heard pipeline investment couple of times there other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on such as amulet, cardiomems, libre 3. are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. listen, if you look at structural heart, i think there's two kind of really good opportunities for us over here; tavr with bringing the product to the u.s. and the launch of our second-generation product in navitor in europe. i mean, these are two opportunities that we have. we know our position. we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the u.s. i think it's great. it will be a great opportunity for us.
and then the second product on structural heart is our tricuspid repair system. it's a great opportunity. it's got a potential kind of billion dollar market opportunity for it. we've done very well with it actually. right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on $100 million basis and we launched this in the middle of the pandemic last year. so i think that's a great near-term opportunity.
and then on crm, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber, and i think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our crm. so we're targeted to enter this market next year, again with a single chamber and then build off there. so i think we've got great opportunity in the device space.
and then the diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. we're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the placements that we've made for id now with covid to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. but i think those are probably more than near-term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that.
joanne wuensch -- citi research -- analyst
thank you very much.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
operator, we'll take one more question.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from josh jennings from cowen. your line is open.
joshua jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks a lot for taking the question. robert, i just wanted to ask a multi-part question on duopolies in the u.s. market. you're about to create one with the entrance of amulet, and then down the line you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market. i was hoping you could just give us your views on u.s. duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, cannibalizing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue, and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those could play out? thanks for taking the question.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. so one can kind of make the analysis here that when you are -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you will do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. so i think on one side, i do believe in that, and i think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. definitely when we came into the u.s. with libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and etc.
so the flip side of that is, competition is -- you could potentially see i guess price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. we've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring. and so i think you've got these two parts of kind of competition in markets. i'd say, that's probably true for two player market or a three player market. but listen, we're excited to come into the laa market share in the u.s. we're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. so for example, we've already began our investment in market expansion in laa with our catalyst trial, which is comparing our products to noac, which is the standard of care. and i know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical vaccine. i think that's good. i think that's positive.
joshua jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks a lot.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so that being said, i'd say here, if i just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrate here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, diagnostics, our established pharmaceutical business and our nutrition. and as i said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business, i think joanne's question, maybe to bob's question also.
optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, i'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in covid testing during the pandemic. but i don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long-term. and i think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. our pipeline is highly productive. we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity, and there is even more on the way here. so we're very excited about that and we're investing across our key growth platform. so we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got. so thanks for joining us today.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisitions.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing and acquisitions
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, president and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we'll take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements, as a result of subsequent events or development, except as required by law.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available at our website at abbott.com. unless otherwise noted, our commentary for sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. ongoing earnings per share were $1.17 reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. given the significant negative impact covid had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. on this comparison, excluding sales from our covid testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter driven by strong sales growth across all four of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals, nutrition and medical devices.
i'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to bob, and i'll start with nutrition where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in adult nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally. since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen two factors positively impact adult nutrition demand. new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. and as a global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our ensure and glucerna brands.
in pediatric nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter led by growth of nearly 9% in the u.s. where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. sales of pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double-digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.
turning to diagnostics. sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of covid testing-related sales. excluding covid testing-related sales, underlying diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. strong sales growth in our underlying diagnostics business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as healthcare systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our alinity platforms. excluding covid testing-related sales, second quarter sales in core laboratory and molecular diagnostics grew mid-single-digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019.
moving to established pharmaceuticals where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in india, china, russia and brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. while we continue to see covid cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in india, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.
and lastly, i'll cover medical devices where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. strong growth in the quarter was led by structural heart, electrophysiology, heart failure and diabetes care, all of which grew double-digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. in structural heart, we achieved the highest number of mitraclip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of june.
now i'll wrap up with diabetes care where strong growth was led by freestyle libre sales of more than $900 million. the global user base for libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the u.s., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.
so in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all four of our major businesses. particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. and our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months.
i'll now turn over the call to bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. bob?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
turning to our results. sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. excluding covid testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter.
regarding other aspects of the p&l for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted r&d investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense was 25.8% of sales. our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. the revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in january due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.
turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. we continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in covid testing-related sales for the full year 2021. and based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales.
turning to the outlook for the third quarter. we forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step down in covid testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. and based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from robbie marcus from jpmorgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and congrats on a really nice quarter.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so, maybe after such a good quarter led by covid testing, i feel like you have a unique perspective looking at both sides of the coin, from covid test, volumes and also device procedure volumes. so, robert, i'd love to get your sense of where you think we are here in fourth quarter and heading into 2022 and any early thoughts you could give us on sort of how to think about the progression of covid testing sales and the recovery and durability of medtech volumes.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think, regarding covid testing, we've obviously, since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. and i think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. and i think we were pretty right there.
i'd say, the key thing that -- and i made this in the comments -- in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the virus. it's had a huge impact on public health around the world. but alone it's not enough. we know that it dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality, but i think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus.
obviously, you're not heading to a hospital. i think we've all heard or seen stories of that. so i think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into q4 and as we go into next year is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. and even with therapeutics, it's still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus. and i think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. and we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. and we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases, cases going up, cases going down. what we don't see that correlation is on screenings. so even as cases have started to come down a little bit in the us, actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. so, i think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into q4 and thinking about going into next year also.
the other, i'd say, key distinction we started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing of tests versus kind of private. and i'd say, in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the us, state governments also. and that continues to be pretty strong. but what we've seen now grow pretty significantly and i think it's aligned to the screening piece is the private side of the market, whether it's otc, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies, we've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here sign contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees.
so, while we're not seeing -- while we see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy tests to give to their employees. so, i think, all of this is basically saying, listen, i don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. so i think that's going to be an important part.
our base business has done very well. it continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, robbie, started in q2. we saw that in devices. we saw that in diagnostics. yeah, there was some softness during q3 as delta and cases increased here in the us. that was probably more in august and throughout half of september. we started to see it kind of repick back up again toward the end of the quarter, first couple weeks. we like what we're seeing here in terms of some pick-up, but these were pockets. i wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown. there were pockets here in the us, some pockets in some countries, but generally speaking that base business is doing very well.
so when you think about 2022, i expect our base business, our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches. and the question here is going to be covid. and i think it's going to be very difficult as we go into next year to be able to forecast a full number -- a full year number of covid next year. i think we'll probably -- we're probably thinking about, ok, well, there's probably a covid number that we're comfortable going into 2022. and then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how covid's going to play out throughout next year. so that's kind of how i see it.
covid testing will be there. we'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. and our base business continues to accelerate. there was a little bit of softness in q3, but i like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. and i like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our epd business, our nutrition business, our diagnostic business, so that's all good.

great. great. that was really helpful. and then, maybe robert, to build on that, i know it's still very early in your planning process. but as you just said, there is a lot of variables, a lot of moving pieces. you've had a great year in devices so far, a bumper year in testing. any early thoughts on how investors should be thinking about 2022 versus 2021 from a top and bottom line perspective? thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think, like i said, we're still in our process. we'll give our guidance of 2022 in january, like we always do, robbie. and i want to see a little bit more in terms of how this pandemic's unfolding here, especially on the covid side but on the base business side. i think our base business, i would say, is -- we've been pretty good at forecasting our business both from a top line, from a margin on our base business.
so, i think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. and then, the question here really is going to be kind of covid testing. and like i said, we'll have a portion of it that i think we'll feel good about putting it in. and then, we'll have to be updating on a rolling basis. and i think that's kind of how to think about it. the base business, which is probably the more sustainable piece, is building momentum and it will go into 2022 with a lot of growth opportunity. and then we'll have to kind of look at covid on a more rolling basis.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.

thank you. our next question comes from bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much. and good morning and congrats on such solid execution. i just have two questions. and in the interest of time, i'll just mention them both upfront because the first one's pretty straightforward. the first question is just on amulet. and i realize it's very early in the launch, but just would love your sort of top-down comments on how things are going and maybe any metrics you can share in terms of perhaps like the percentage of your us coronary counts that are now active with amulet, so would love some just color there.
and then, the second question is more of a broad-based question. i was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on inflation and supply chain because the headlines are obviously, they're just constant. but the message from abbott and other companies we follow just seems to be that it's sort of generally manageable. so just wondering if the you can kind of talk to that a little bit, if you can quantify the headwinds or just give us a better understanding of why it's manageable and just put some perspective around it for us. thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, i'll take the amulet. and then i'll let bob kind of talk through the inflation and supply chain. i mean, i would just say, it is manageable but we have a great team. so -- and i'll let bob cover that.
on amulet, listen, we received approval in august. we've already initiated the launch. i know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last two calls about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we were going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. and so we released that data really close to our approval. and i think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that.
i will say regarding the data, i mean, you saw when we released the data. the product's got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. we've got pretty broad portfolio of sizes. and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. the steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement. and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies.
and then, you saw the data, superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- following right after the procedure. and ultimately that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. so i think we've got a great product here. i think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. right now, i would say, we have a goal of certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. and in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them -- of that target. so i think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, our accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we can start to build the usage and familiarity with the system.
we've got a really strong commercial presence here. and i think that's a key aspect in the rollout. the implants of these devices, the electrophysiologists or the interventional cardiologists. i mean, we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call points. so that's worked out very well too. there's always certain amount of coordination that's required there and that coordination has been fantastic. i'm really pleased to see that.
initial feedback has been super positive. so, very happy with the initial signs. like you said, it's about a month, month-and-a-half into it. all the signs that i'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish amulet as another product in the category. and then on top of that, we're making the investments, like i said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials, catalyst is one of them that's important also. so, i'd say, first month-and-a-half, very, very pleased with what i'm seeing.
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
okay. thanks. i'll take the inflation comments. so, i think, inflation and supply chain are really linked together. the global supply chains have not been able to keep up with strong demand out there. and so, like others, we're seeing some increased input cost across areas of our business. we're experiencing some higher shipping costs and, in some cases, higher commodity costs. i'd say, the commodity costs are more kind of in the nutrition area of the business. in some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit and we plan to do that. in other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist. and so, we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs.
as robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization, supply chain organizations and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. and our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. and so, we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from josh jennings from cowen. your line is open.
josh jennings -- cowen -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. and congratulations on the strong 3q results. hopefully can you just hear maybe some puts and takes or help us understand some of the puts and takes of 2022 operating margin? clearly covid testing is going to be a factor, but any other drivers of operating margin expansion that you would highlight as we move into 2022 and any other levers that abbott's able to pull to drive earnings next year depending on how the covid testing environment plays out?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'd say, like i said in the beginning, i mean, think 2022, our base business, our underlying base business is going to grow very strong both on the top and the bottom. so we'll see margin expansion in that business. and that's a combination, like bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs. so that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion.
and then, just the nature of the mix, as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, i'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. so, i think, a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line and the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022.
and like i said, the covid piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. we'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with, but those -- i would say, those are the kind of key drivers here. our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. i want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, r&d and sg&a so those profiles we want to maintain. obviously, if you look at our profiles right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the covid piece. but if you look historically where we've been in the low-7%s in r&d and sg&a between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land.
josh jennings -- cowen -- analyst
thanks for that. and then, just quick follow-up on libre. we've had some consultants talk about potential for abbott to add other analytes onto the platform and particularly the addition of ketone monitoring as a potential competitive advantage. any updates just in terms of how the 3.0 on tap here, but any updates in terms of the future development trends for libre and how you continue to maintain your competitive edge here? thanks for taking the questions.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i've always -- we've always said that libre was a platform. we always -- i know -- every time you put out a number, it becomes like the next, what is that and what's after that that. and so, we've launched -- libre 2 is doing very well in the us. we launched libre 3 in europe. and we'll obviously be rolling libre 3 out.
regarding your question on analytes, yeah, i mean, that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of libre, the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. you mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. we have a blood ketone system so that we believe it's an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. we think that that's a real important kind of feature. if you look at -- going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding dka and we think that that might also be an opportunity too.
but that's only one analyte and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. and as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market. but i'm really excited about using the libre platform here to be able to kind of expand even beyond diabetes.
josh jennings -- cowen -- analyst
great. thanks so much.

thank you. our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the questions. robert, i wanted to focus on the device side and the pipeline. just starting with amulet, to ask bob's earlier question another way, the surveys seem to be coming back suggesting amulet can take about a third of the us market and maybe even 20% next year. it's not easy for a second to market to become market leader, but amulet has a nice profile. what's your reaction to some of these consensus estimates for share? do you think you can do better? and i had a follow-up.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i mean, amulet is new to the us, but it's not new to the international markets. when you look at the international market, amulet's got a 50% market share. i've seen some of the reports, not all of them, but i'm aware of some of these surveys that are done with different physicians. and what i read and what i see of them is, it's similar what i see here in the us versus what we actually see in europe, which is, it's a great product. its size portfolio is an advantage. its closure rate is also an advantage. and yeah, as i said, this is a multi-billion dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also.
but at the same time, invest to develop it. i think that's an important part here also of, larry. so, as i mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. we're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant but also to develop the patient referral network. and we're going to be investing in clinical trials. i think the catalyst trial is going to be comparing it to noac. i think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also. so i think it's a combination of kind of market expansion. and yeah, we're competitive with our offering. we're competitive with our team. and i think 50% internationally is a good aspiration to have here in the us.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, wanted to ask about portico and cardiomems. so, with portico, you have navitor outside the us. do you think you need that in the us to really drive share? and do you think you can compete without an intermediate and low risk indication, which i don't think you'll have till about 2024. just lastly on cardiomems, how are you feeling about the label expansion and the commercial opportunity given the covid impact you mentioned on the guide-hf trial? thanks for taking the questions.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure, larry. let me talk about portico and tavi here more broadly. this is a hugely important segment in structural heart. we want to be a structural heart leader. we had that vision when we put the businesses together with st. jude. and we know that we need to be a true player here in the tavi space. so i'm really looking at this for us as a long game. and what a i mean by that is, we're launching portico in the us. navitor to your question is a great second-generation device. we got it ce marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device. its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. and yeah, i want to bring it to the us also, but not because i feel we need to because portico is not competitive. portico is very competitive. but in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the tavi space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second-generation here to the us. we'll have to also look about how do we develop further on navitor.
so i think that we've got about 5 share in europe. that's not my aspiration for the tavi space. to your point, there's two pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. and -- but we have a higher aspiration and just kind of 5 share, which is what we have in europe. so i think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline, in the clinical data, you're right, our kind of low risk -- intermediate low risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on but it's there, we're investing in it. because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. so, i'm excited about it. and i know the team is too to be able to kind of be a real go-to full service player in the field of structural heart.
regarding cardiomems, listen, i think the data, i think, was pretty compelling. i mean, this is the second, and you know this, larry, this is the second rct trial that we've done. and i'm a big believer in rct trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence. we filed for the label expansion at the end of june. i think the data was very compelling. and part of it is expansion to class 2 and class 4 and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated bmp, which is today just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. so, i think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second rct that we've done, a very large one also on of top of champions, the champions trial, i think this is a great opportunity here for us to the develop this market.
one of the things that we did in the quarter here also is, we now have a more dedicated business unit for heart failure, where both the lvad and cardiomems team are going to be combined under one gm, very similar to the what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. so, i think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond.
i'm not going to comment on when, all i can tell you is we filed it at the end of q2. and i think the data is very strong and we'll just leave it like that. and i'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, robert.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from cecilia furlong from morgan stanley. your line is open.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for taking the questions. i wanted to ask about just your neuromod business, sds as well as other deferrable procedures and can you walk through just sequential trends in the quarter, if you started to see recovery in some of your more deferrable procedures trending ahead of others and also how you're thinking about the ability to recapture deferred procedures, if the majority of recapture procedure recapture kind of occurring 4q or staffing shortages, do some of this recovering procedure recapture flow into 2022?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i would say, this is probably out of our device businesses, the business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post-covid. it's probably more elective, like you said, cecilia. so it has been lagging a bit. it's been pretty flat, i would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory, if we look at our trials and our implants, so -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. we have visibility to the pipeline of patients. we work closely with the surgery centers and we've got visibility to that. we're not expecting a big bolus to come into q4 and then we'll have to kind of see how q1 and q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there.
but what we can control, and that's what i focus -- we focus the team on, is on our pipeline. and i think the team here has done a really good job. i'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. neurosphere, which is this novel remote care platform, we've launched it. it's the first kind of system that was approved by the fda. we did a full market release at the end of june. and i really like the numbers we're seeing. we've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. and not only is it a remote programmer, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. so using adoption of that tool is great, because i think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exist in this business. so that's gone very well. and i think that will help get better visibility.
another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable segment which is about half of the market. we really don't have a competitive system in there and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. so, we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year.
and then, we've also made investments in trials. i think probably the most notable one is distinct, which is an indication for non-surgical lower back. we've completed enrollment in that study. so i think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. and then, if we see the bolus of patients come back in q1 and q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. and i wanted to ask as well about your recent acquisition of walk vascular. really at a high level, can you talk about your outlook just for the underlying market growth in the peripheral space over the next several years versus some of your other high growth target end markets, including diabetes and ep? and are there other areas you would look to build out around your vascular business? and beyond that too, just what's your current outlook for pursuing a pe indication for the thrombectomy system? and thank you.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we've been looking at this area for quite a bit. as i always said, we're always looking, we're always studying and this was an opportunity that we saw, we think it's an attractive segment. we see it about $700 million, growing double-digits. and this kind of fell right into that sweet spot of kind of strategic, makes sense strategically for us. we've got a commercial footprint out there with an endovascular sales and service team. we know the customers. we have the call point. and we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. so, this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio and that integration is going pretty well.
i don't expect any significant contributions in q4. but as we go into next year, i think it will have an impact on our vascular business. and yes, i mean, like i said, there are plenty of segments in the endo space, i would say, that we continue to study, we continue to look at, areas that we're interested in. and if we find the right moment for us to be able to add those opportunities, we will.
regarding your question on the key indication, yes, absolutely we know that is very important in the peripheral space. so we're investing. that's one of the key aspects in the integration is to invest to be able to get that indication established. so, yes, we are working on that.
cecilia furlong -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. robert, my first one was going back to testing, i think your q4 assumptions of $1 billion to $1.4 billion, that's a substantial step down versus 2q. i'm curious -- where are we on capacity right now and what is the demand for these testing products right now? are we seeing any sequential step-down in demand right now? and i think you guys did win about $600 million of dod contracts. is that baked into the q4 number or is that a fiscal '22 contributor?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so, regarding the q4 forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion here, our capacity is, we can do significantly more than that, vijay, especially as we've -- q3, we didn't have the full ramp-up, but now we're finishing this month here, we'll be in full ramp-up mode. so we can do more than the $1.4 billion. i think the factor here that we're looking at is, as i said in the opening comments here in the first question, i continue to see the surveillance and the screening market to continue to increase. and that's with kind of binax and id now also. so we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here.
i'd say, the only question we've got here, a little bit, is on the symptomatic. and that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the us that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. so that's one part of the factor. the other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. we've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in otc. if you look at nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share for the month of september. we dropped to about 60% just because of supply and now we're back up to 75% share. and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. so in that number, i baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. but if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number too.
so those are the drivers and the thinking there, vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
the dod contract, $600 million, is that assumed in q4 or is that a fiscal '22 contributor?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're going to have to -- yeah. so the dod contract is actually -- i think you're quoting the maximum amount of the contract, which i know is kind of what got a lot of the news headlines, but the contract actually has a minimum amount which is significantly lower than that, less than $100 million. so it's really going to depend here on the dod and the federal government in terms of their purchasing. we factored in a little bit of that minimum piece in q4. and as i talk about going into next year, that will be a portion of the part that we will feel comfortable with adding on. so -- but it's a pretty big range, vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is. so...
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and just one on your earlier comments, robert, on the sg&a, looking back at historical trends of 29% to 30%, r&d at 7% of revenues, was that comment referring to fiscal '22, what the opex as a percentage of revenue should look like for your base business, and then the variable over and beyond that should be covid, is that the right way to think about fiscal '22?
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
the comment was more about ensuring that you don't see that there's a drop in investment when you look at our profile in q3. in terms of r&d, it's down to 6%, our sg&a is down to 25%. so that comment was more about there's a little bit of a distortion factor here because of covid and we're going to make sure that we continue to invest in the business.
if you look at the investment we've made, vijay, this year, we've added about $1 billion between r&d and sg&a to the business so that we can continue to drive the top line and at the same time drive the long-term sustainability of the business with the r&d investments. i talked about how we could pulsate that spend not only this year but as we go into next year. a portion of that spend is a little bit more discretionary on the sg&a side and we'll be looking at that. but -- so the comment there was more about ensuring that there wasn't a distortion, we at least understood the distortion of covid in terms of our profiles.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt miksic from credit suisse. your line is open.
matt miksic -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. and congrats on the strong results. so, maybe just a follow-up on some of the things you were just talking about, sort of this concept of reinvesting the proceeds of this very strong covid business. so there's a perception out there, i think, because covid testing is maybe not permanent and hard to predict, that it's somehow less important or harder to value than the rest of your businesses.
but the last few months obviously and this quarter $1.5 billion of upside in q3 is, by our estimates, more than $0.5 billion in operating cash and that goes up against your $2 billion or $2.5 billion operating cash run rate. so, the question is, in addition to kind of being part of the solution as you've talked about to the pandemic, maybe drill down a little bit into some of the things you were just describing, opportunities to invest behind, which ones of your growth programs do you see an opportunity to sort of dial things up and how, if at all, does this change maybe the way you think about m&a and your activity on that front? thanks.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think you captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at covid. as i said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of covid. and that strategy has been in place and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond covid that even goes beyond flu and rsv and respiratory viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. so that's one investment for sure.
you can see the impact on investment on some of the business. you see it in nutrition. so we have been putting more discretionary advertising and direct consumer promotion in that business and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. we've obviously put investment into libre both on the sg&a side. we've rolled out a new tv commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. increased our sales force in the us and other key markets for libre so that we can call on more physicians and you see the impact there on libre.
i mean, we did almost $1 billion of sales of libre this quarter in the us, it's about 65%. we're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. we've got about a 90% market share of non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. we've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. so that growth is also being supported. and we've got all these new product launches that i've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists and we're funding that also. so, i think that that's very clearly where we're putting our investments.
we talked about r&d investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23. and that's predominantly been in the diagnostics and device areas also. so, it's been pretty broad-based. that $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. and if i ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go too. so there's no shortage of opportunity.
and then, the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation as a result of the covid business. and yes, it has generated a lot of cash. we have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the us for covid, for mitraclip, for libre. so we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. and you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year. we increased our dividend by 25%. you saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in q2 and we've stepped that up even further in q3.
and we got capacity to do more of that in q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. so, we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. and on the m&a side, i mean, i've talked about this. we think there is a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us, that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for shareholders, we'll do that also. right now, i'd say, i think the medtech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially the ones that we would be interested in and high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. so, we're in the mode of studying and paying attention.
i think the good news here is that we don't really need m&a to be able to support what i think is pretty top-tier performance here. so that's -- it's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at covid. and both funds are internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends and if there's a growth vehicle out there, i think makes sense, we won't be shy for that also.
so i'll just close here a little bit and just say, our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. i'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. we've historically really focused on our organic pipelines and that continues to be highly productive. we're entering to very new and attractive gross segments across our portfolio and there's more products along the way there. so, we're investing in our key platforms, as i've said.
covid testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. at what level? i can't say right now for next year. i've given a range on what i think is going to look like in q4. and there could be opportunities there for us to -- first to do better than that. but i think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year. and we're a leader in that segment.
we built scale, we built manufacturing and we know how to operate in this environment, whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumer. so, our focus right now is, we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum and i think we're well placed strategically here as we go into next year.
so, with that, i'll thank you all for joining us today.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] this call is being recorded by abbott. with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by abbott. it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission.
i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisition.
scott leinenweber -- vice president, investor relations, licensing & acquisitions
good morning. and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, president and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we'll take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including expected financial results for 2021. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1-a, risk
factors, to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory findings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert.
robert b. ford -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. excluding covid testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year.
as we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of healthcare businesses continues to prove highly resilient. even as covid case rates surged in the us and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals and diabetes care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital base businesses.
this has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding covid tests, of 11% on an organic basis through the first nine months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year.
as a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year.
i'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to bob. and i'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. strong growth in the quarter was led by us pediatric and international adult nutrition. in pediatric nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the us from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. sales of pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double-digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.
in adult nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally, as we continue to see strong demand for our ensure and glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage.
turning to diagnostics. sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding covid testing-related sales. during the quarter, as the delta variant spread and covid cases surged, particularly in the us, demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. in total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million covid tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic.
over the of last several months, we've learned that covid vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable, and easy to use, is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month.
moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in china, russia and india, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.
and lastly, i'll cover medical devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in rhythm management, structural heart, heart failure and diabetes care.
in structural heart, we continued to enhance our portfolio in large, fast growing markets with the recent us fda approvals of amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
in heart failure, we announced results from the guide-hf trial of our cardiomems system. as with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the healthcare industry, a portion of the cardiomems trial overlapped with the covid-19 pandemic. after adjusting for this impact, cardiomems demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. and we filed with the us fda for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year.
during the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of walk vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called jeti that removes peripheral blood clots. peripheral thrombectomy is a large high growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence.
and i'll wrap up with diabetes care, where strong growth was led by freestyle libre sales of nearly $1 billion. during the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for libre to well over 3.5 million users.
so in summary, we continued to achieve strong well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. covid testing, particularly covid testing, remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics and abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. and based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our eps guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year.
i'll now turn over the call to bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. bob?
robert e. funck -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
turning to our results. sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, you along with global covid testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. excluding covid testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter.
regarding other aspects of the p&l for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted r&d investment was 6% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense was 25% of sales. our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. the revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in july due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.
turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. we forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of covid testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding covid testing-related sales, in the low double-digits versus last year. and based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around one-half of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong finish to a strong year. robert, can you talk about how you thought about the 2022 guidance? why is $2.5 billion for covid testing the right starting point? and how are you thinking about reinvesting the upside from covid testing, implied in the 470 -- $4.70 eps guidance? and i had one follow up. thank you.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, larry. i'd say the beginning of the year, you're coming into the year and you're trying to find the right balance, right, you're trying to find the right balance on your long-term growth opportunities that abbott has, which i think are pretty unique, and balancing that with, i'd say, probably some uncertainty. and i'd say every year there's a little bit of uncertainty the beginning of of the year. but i'd say this year is probably a little bit more than usual.
so you're trying to find that balance and i'm pretty sure we'll talk about some of the long-term growth opportunities. but if you think about some of the challenges in forecasting right now, and there's a lot of dynamics that are existing from a macroeconomic standpoint that are out there that, quite frankly, aren't necessarily unique to abbott, but that are out there, whether it's the pandemic and the duration of the current surge, potential new waves and how long they will last, staffing shortages that we've seen for the hospital-based kind of part of our business, quite frankly, patients willingness to go in, to do a procedure during the surges. so that's probably one kind of big bucket to look at. another area, obviously, on the macro side is supply chain and inflation challenges that every company is facing and obviously kind of currency headwinds.
so i'd say those are all challenges that are facing a lot of medtech companies, companies and healthcare and quite frankly, a lot of companies outside of our sector. probably what's a little bit different for us, another fact to consider in our forecast is just covid testing and and how is that going to play out throughout the rest of the year, given the magnitude of what the testing could look like between it completely going away or it staying or increasing at this level. so factoring all those kind of elements over here, i think this was the right starting point for us just to start off like that. and i think this initial full year guidance is contemplating not only some of those challenges, but also contemplating on the flip side, a very strong underlying kind of abbott-based business, as i said in my comments, high single digit growth.
so there are definitely acceleration in a lot of our portfolio versus where we were pre-pandemic. we've got investment in this guidance to be able to support not only all of our launches that we engaged in toward the end of last year. beginning of this year, we've got launches and opportunities. and that's all been contemplated and fully funded.
and the initial covid testing forecast of 2.5 -- i don't expect covid to simply go to zero starting the second quarter. but the challenge of forecasting the magnitude, i felt, is the right way to -- and quite frankly, i talked about this in october. we will be updating it as we go along. we've got a lot -- we built a lot of capacity.
you've seen that over this, like, last year and a half, especially in rapid testing. so we have that capacity and we will be updating it. so if we had we had typically done our $0.10 range guide here, larry, our consensus -- we would have been right in the middle of where you guys are at. but i didn't want to cap the upside, which is why we're at the least $4.70.
so if i kind of sum it up, i look at our guidance now and i say, ok, we've contemplated as much as we can of some of the challenges that a lot of companies are facing, whether it's supply chain, duration of pandemic, medical device procedures, etc. i've fully funded our growth platforms that we're very excited about. and there's potential for the upside of more covid testing because i don't think it goes away, which would then fall through at a good click and provide that upside. so i think that's probably the best way to summarize.
it's de-risk, it's fully funded for long-term growth opportunities, and we've got potential upside as we go into the remainder of the year.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
that's super helpful. robert, just for my follow up, libre had another remarkable year. how are you thinking about libre growth in 2022 and what are the drivers of that growth this year? thanks for taking the questions.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, yeah, i mean, you saw it. it continues to grow at a very strong rate and a very large base, 35 -- over 35% this year, 4 million users now. we've initiated geographic expansion of libre 3, and that'll start in the next couple of weeks, moving out of germany into u.k.
and france. those are probably kind of key markets that we're expanding over there for the next couple of weeks. and if i think about 2022, larry, i mean, i'm looking at here strong double-digit growth. we've been growing about a billion dollars of incremental sales per year, and i expect i expect that growth to be at least in that range.
so that probably translates into 25% growth. i think the biggest driver for us is, quite frankly, not just this year, but as we look forward, it's still very under-penetrated range. and i'm talking about being a leader in terms of patients with 4 million users, where we've talked about numbers between 60 million, 70 million, 80 million people around the world that could be benefiting from continuous glucose monitoring and sensor-based monitoring. so i'd say biggest opportunities we've got continue to be international.
the cgm penetration internationally is still much lower than in the u.s. and then moving into -- more aggressively into patient segments that historically have been under penetrated, kind of look at the type 2s on single-injection therapy. so we've got great opportunity there. u.s., i would say, is another good opportunity for us.
we have very good year this year, close to like 60% growth. i think that's the number. now over a million users. we've made the investments that we need to make last year in terms of sales force and advertising, and that's paying dividends in terms of new users.
we continue to have a high share of new user growth. so as a combined what we're doing internationally, expansion of libre 3, continued growth in the u.s., expanding into pretty under-penetrated population of type 2s, and i think we've still got -- like i've kind of said, still in the early innings of the libre story here.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks so much, robert.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robbie marcus from jpmorgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
oh, great. and i'll also add my congratulations on a nice quarter. two for me. i'll ask them both up front.
first question, maybe you could spend a minute on cadence throughout the year. first quarter has a lot more covid testing sales than we had thought, but also implies somewhat of a different cadence than we had been thinking. so just top and bottom line, what are the impacts there? how's inflation, fx hitting throughout? and then second question, it's probably tied into it. if you could just touch on what you're seeing in current device and procedure trends as we sit here today and how you're thinking about the evolution of that over the course of '22.
thanks.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, your first questions got multiple sub questions there. robbie. so let me take the first one and then i'll go back -- so i'm going to take the second one and then i'll go back to your first one because it does contemplate some of the challenges on inflation that might be worthwhile spending some time. just talk a little bit about also.
but in terms of demand dynamics, especially in the more hospital-based business here, robbie, we saw a real nice trajectory recovery in the beginning of q4. we were -- and i always like to compare versus 2019, at least for 2021, to avoid some of the comp pieces. so we were improving our growth rates in our probably more cardio-like businesses. let's use that as a proxy to be in that kind of 3% to 4% range and improving as the quarter has progressed.
and q4 was looking like, again, a continuation of that progression until probably december, where we saw a pretty big drop because of omicron in most of the device -- of our device businesses. probably only two that we didn't see that drop was heart failure. that was probably up in the mid-20s in december versus 2019 and obviously libre, which was up probably like in the 70s percent versus 2019. so we did have an impact in these parts of the business again, is probably driven by omicron impact of not only staffing, i'd say, but also even just patients basically postponing a little bit and not wanting to go to hospital.
and i think that's continued a little bit here into january. i'd say geographically seeing a little bit more of that impact in the u.s. compared to other geographies, at least for us. europe and asia, as have held up a little bit better than the u.s.
and then we've contemplated as best as we can what that recovery curve is going to look like. we'll see some pressure of that, i'd say, probably january, february going into march. we expect it to get better and then q2 will be better. and if you look at the second half of this year, we expect to -- for these businesses to be more at their normal run rate.
so i think i'd say that's what we're seeing and that's kind of how we're forecasting the rest of the year. actually i was pretty pleased that some of the new product launches that we had during the quarter, we were always cautious about ok do we launch the product during -- in this environment. and they did pretty well both in europe and in the u.s., too. so i think that speaks well about still the need for the products and the technologies and the innovation.
so the consumer side of -- the consumer-facing part of our business, i mentioned libre, but you saw it in nutrition and epd. they've done pretty well. the pandemic, they did pretty well in q4. so i didn't necessarily see the impact of omicron to those businesses, like we didn't see it in delta either.
so. so we would expect those businesses to be pretty resilient. and the key driver there, as i talk a little bit about libre, is just kind of innovation. on your first question regarding cadence, i mean, part of it is this combination that i said recovering device and core testing procedures that we see going into q2 and into q3 and q4.
and then, as we have more, let's say, call it, confidence and precision regarding our covid testing, we'll see that kind of flow through and then we'll be able to update you. i think when we're here in april, we'll have a better sense of what q2 is going to going to look like, not only for the u.s., but also internationally. and as i said, having that ability to then kind of update the forecast with that covid number, we will -- we'll let it flow through. so i think you also had a question about inflation.
i mean, that is another area that we're working on and focused on and probably ask bob to give you some color on that.
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
ok. yeah, robbie, you actually kind of asked about currency and inflation. i'll cover currency first. i mean, we saw u.s.
dollar kind of strengthen since the middle of last year, in particular over the last few months. and so as i said in my opening remarks, at the current rate, that's about 2% headwind on the top line for the year. we're going to see that a greater impact in the first quarter, around 3% in kind of -- and in the second quarter, and you don't get the impact would be a little bit less severe as we kind of go through the course of the year into the back half of the year. in terms of inflation, inflation of supply chain challenges are really kind of linked together as supply chains have not been able to catch up to the strong demand that's out there.
and so we're seeing some impacts here, certainly not unique to us or our industry. and we're seeing those impacts across transportation, cost, manufacturing inputs, commodities, etc. from a pricing standpoint, we have the flexibility to just price a bit in some areas of the business, and we're doing so. that's really more in the consumer-facing businesses like nutrition.
in other areas of the business, that flexibility doesn't exist. so i'd say in aggregate kind of across those headwinds, we're seeing impacts on gross margin of roughly half a billion dollars and that's contemplated in our guidance. and i think as supply chains start to normalize over time, we would expect to see improving cost in some areas. for example, in commodities for nutrition.
those costs have kind of moved up and down historically over time. but currently our kind of outlook doesn't assume any significant changes kind of versus the current dynamics that we're seeing in the market.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for all the answers.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. good morning, robert. i've got two questions. maybe my first one was on the new product side.
robert, you made some comments on perhaps a consumer kind of product [inaudible]. i'm just curious, how do you see the opportunity here? it's slightly different, perhaps from our perspective. but for abbott, i mean, you guys have played in consumer markets. how big is this opportunity? perhaps some sense for when u.s.
launch, timing could be and should we expect more analysts, right? i thank you, guys. i had four analysts at cbs, but i'm curious, is there are there other products expected to come down the pipeline?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, vijay. so we made a decision to put a stake in the ground here and start talking about what we've always believed to be another opportunity, a sizable opportunity for abbott. and that was really using the libre platform that we had developed to look into other analytes, other areas. i talked about this recently.
quite frankly, we talked about it several years ago also. and you referenced some of the some of the analytes that we have been working on ketones, lactate, alcohol, glucose for not people with non-diabetes, and those are big opportunities. as i've said, the model is a little bit different. it is probably a much larger tam in terms of people, but the usage of the sensors is probably more intermittent than you would kind of get on a person, for example, diabetes today, where we're very clear whether you're a type i on a pump or a type i injector or type ii.
like we know through the data we've covered here in terms of the usage patterns. so the use is kind of a little bit different, but the sample size is significant. if you think about like a keto sensor and the opportunity to be able to provide real time feedback for somebody who's trying to manage their very keto diet, i think there's a large amount of people, large consumer pool that whether it's more disciplined keto diets or kind of more on an on/off basis, there's a very large amount of people. and we'll have to just think about how to market it a little bit differently.
and our go-to-market strategy will be a little bit differently. but i'd say we've always seen this as a big opportunity and we funded it. we have a separate team that is obviously leveraging the platform, but they're managed differently. they have a completely different organizational structure, and they're just focused on developing not only the technical side of the analytes, but obviously doing all the market development work.
so we're really, really in the early innings stages here. but i think the numbers can be pretty significant and pretty large and why not? over a good period of time, maybe it's even bigger than diabetes once you lined these up. the first phase of analytes, we announced at ces that this was our intention that we were designing these. timing, we expect to launch our first products outside of the united states toward the second half of this year.
in the united states, we'll obviously be having the conversations with the agency in terms of how that regulatory path is going to shape up. probably a little bit too early right now to talk about that. but we're very excited about this opportunity because we've seen this opportunity many, many years back and made the moves. on your question about other analytes, yeah, i would say part one or phase i, i would say is what i would call these more consumer-facing more consumer-driven opportunities.
but we are looking at other analytes that would probably have, i would say, more of a medical clinical application, whether it's in the hospital or for discharges, etc. so there is opportunity there that we're also working on. so i think it's very large and we're just in the beginning right now in terms of market creation.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, robert, and maybe my second question in the balance sheet, i think you guys probably have over $40 billion of capacity right now, conservatively. with valuations coming down, what kind of opportunities do you see? and one of the things that always strikes me is abbott is very large and diagnostics, number one and number two in most of your end markets. if you look at diagnostics, liquid biopsy, cancer screening, diagnostics, that's a massive opportunity but i don't see abbott having a stake in the ground in that area. is that an area that would interest abbott?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i answer that specifically, i'm not going to necessarily show all my cards here, but i guess what i will say regarding the m&a question here is, yeah, there's -- there seems to be some dislocation now, and i think this could make sense. if there's anything out there that looks strategic for us and that makes financial sense, then yeah, we'll be -- we've got plenty of capacity, as you said. we've generated a lot of strong cash flow and, quite frankly, it's been a meaningful step up in that cash flow over the last couple of year and a half or so. so, yeah, strategically financial fits, as i've always said, we're in a great position now to be able to look at that.
device and diagnostics, i will say, are the areas that we're looking at more carefully. scott's team is always looking at everything, but he's got a more special lens here in devices and diagnostics. the areas that you referenced are areas that are in the list of things that we would be interested in looking at. tuck-in and medium-sized deals probably are more likely if, again, if those situations present themselves.
but again, we're always looking at everything. so i would say, yeah, nothing has changed regarding what i've said about m&a. if it's strategic and it makes financial sense and can, deliver value for our shareholders, we are now in a great position as a result of all the efforts that we've had, quite frankly, on cash flow conversion and now with kind of covid cash, that also helps.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from josh jennings from cowen. your line is open.
josh jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, gentlemen, thanks for taking the questions. rob, just first wanted to ask a question on 2022 guidance and understand you don't want to put a top end of the range there and cap the upside. clearly, there's potential upside with the increased covid testing outside of that $2.5 billion revenue stream that you're expecting the early part of the year. but just in a scenario where covid testing does fall off and that guidance for the revenue from that franchise turns into reality, can you just refresh this on some of the other levers you have that you can pull to drive eps growth? i think last year in june, when you -- when covid testing fell off, your team talked about share repurchase, accretive m&a, some cost reductions.
but just wanted to get a refresh there and then see if you could help us think through those levers. and then second question is just on the diabetes franchise, and clearly, libre has a long runway, you're looking over the years talked about one of your answers about the consumer opportunity. but how should we be thinking about the diabetes franchise and abbott's desire to kind of leverage the positioning there with other products, either insulin delivery devices or other portfolio ads as we move into 2022 and beyond? thanks for taking the questions.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. on your first one, i mean, like i said, we de-risk, we fully funded and we've got potential upside for the covid testing. if covid testing in that scenario, which i think is highly likely, kind of falls off, then we'll have to obviously look at kind of the investments we're making and kind of make the adjustments that we have to make, especially as we start to move into 2023. i don't think that is the case.
i think that covid testing is going to be still around. i think omicron has catalyzed a pretty significant shift in global rapid testing and screening. and the question here is just going to be how does it evolve over the next couple of nine months, 12 months here. so but that being said, to your question on that scenario, you'd have to make adjustments, as i've said we would.
but right now, i'm managing. we're managing the enterprise as a whole and we're obviously got profits that are coming from covid that we're reinvesting into the business. if that turns out to not be the case this year, then -- like i said, we're fully funded on our growth platforms. and then we'd have to kind of make adjustments or look at that investment level as we go into 2023.
buybacks is another opportunity that we've got. we've got a lot of flexibility here also. last year, we bought i think it was about $2 billion in 2021. and i anticipate being active in the market again this year since we do have that capacity.
so and your second question, i think, was on diabetes, right? and growth opportunities, is that -- could you just --""
josh jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. absolutely. just thinking about any anything you can share just in terms of internal development programs outside of advancing libre in diabetes and on the consumer channel on the sensing side, any other products within the diabetes device realm that you could add to the portfolio or we should be thinking about the diabetes franchise. just sticking, sticking with the playbook that you have, it's been so successful the last number of years and has as a long runway.
thanks.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
got it. got it. so listen, yeah, we're in the beginning here. there's still a lot of opportunity, still a lot of under penetration, whether it's internationally or type iis.
as i've said, the key aspect here is to ensure your pipeline is relevant and is advancing. we've launched libre 3 in europe and will be expanding that launch now globally. i expect it to be able to bring libre 3 here into the u.s. i won't necessarily get into the specifics, but i figured you guys would eventually ask this.
we have filed libre 3 here in the u.s. as [inaudible] to the fda last year. i won't get into specifics about timing there, but it's -- the review process happens in the same agency that reviews diagnostic tests. so as you can imagine, there's a lot of busy work going on with that area of the agency.
so we've obviously seen our data that we've submitted to the agency, we've obviously seen now data from a competitive system, and i'd say we're feeling pretty good about where we stand, so. so i think that's a key component there as they expand the portfolio. i've talked about libre 4, not necessarily what exactly is that, but we do have that as an active program. connecting to insulin delivery systems is also part of that strategy.
and we've got active programs with all pump suppliers and pen delivery systems also to be able to connect libre on to that. so i think we'll stay focused on making the best sensor, sticking to our strategy of consumer friendly, showing outcomes, price for access and affordability and continue to innovate with our sensor platform and then look at opportunities to use those sensors to not only expand into other platforms, but also to connect to other devices.

great. thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joanne wuensch from citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking the questions. i have a big picture one and a specific one. big picture, one of the themes of your keynote address at ces was the marriage of tech and medtech. and i'm curious if you could highlight how you sort of take that lens in terms of your product pipeline.
and then my specific question has to do with your structural heart franchise. portico is out in the market, amulet is out in the market, and i would love just a little bit of an update on how those products are doing. thanks.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so, yeah, i've talked about this convergence. and quite frankly, we've seen this convergence occurring probably when we are doing the st. jude acquisition and integration.
and we started to set a lot of our portfolios to be able to connect to whether it's consumer electronics or clouds or other elements like that to ultimately be able to empower the consumer and just provide better solutions to ultimately improve outcomes. so i think you saw the device portfolio has been going down that path for quite some time now as very pleasantly -- very pleasant to see that start to look not only the cardiovascular side, also in the neuromodulation side. like i said in my opening comments on our virtual clinic, i think that's got an opportunity to change the business model of that business and at the same time provide better outcomes for not only dbs, but also spinal cord stimulation, too. so, you've seen that in devices.
we then started to see diagnostics and you saw a little bit of that thinking as we develop binax. we wanted to make sure that we were kind of integrating not just our expertise in developing an accurate test to be able to detect covid, but also integrate it into an app where you can kind of have your pass in your phone, etc., and working with partners to be able to kind of do that, so. so i think you're seeing it across all of the portfolio. in our pharma business, we're using digital tools to be able to ensure that patients are taking their medications.
so that's pretty, i'd say, a strategic element going across all of our businesses and how we're thinking about it, so. i wouldn't say it's just one part of the portfolio, but i think it's a convergence that is happening and we want to be leaders in that convergence across all of our portfolio. regarding your question on structural heart, so i think you mentioned portico and amulet. so listen amulets, we received approval in q3 last year, moved quickly to launch.
i'd say initial feedback has been very strong, especially in the areas of superior closure rates, the need to be able to need to be able to leave the hospital without blood thinners. and also we've heard a lot of broader sizes to better fit more anatomies and give them more of that flexibility. so that's done very well. as part of the launch, we wanted to make sure that we had good proctor and good peer-to-peer proctoring.
so obviously that that became a little bit of a challenge in november and december after thanksgiving and into december. but i think despite all of that, i think we've done pretty well and i think we did about 500 procedures last year, mostly happening -- mostly in q4. and if you look at what we did in december, that would put us at about a 10% market share, which is i think is pretty good. obviously, we're not satisfied with that, given what we know we can do what we've done in europe, but i think it's very much aligned to where we want it to be regarding the end of the year and as we enter into 2022.
so i think that's going very well. portico, we're -- as i've said, this is an important area for structural heart. we know that there are two entrenched competitors in there. we think we've got great technology also, and we're going about it very systematically, very methodically to build our position.
we launched our generation two product in europe, our navitor product, and again, that's received great feedback also. and there's pretty competitive clinical profile here for high risk surgery patients. so we're making the investments that we know we need to make. to be able to expand our position here, so i feel good about our structural heart portfolio.
i've talked about how this is a big opportunity for us. we've made the investments and i think we're in a great position as we go into 2022.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt taylor from ubs. your line is open.
matt taylor -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking the question. so i just had two margin questions i wanted to ask. the first one, i guess i'll frame it as if we take the 150 from q1, that implies about $1.6 to $1.7 for the remaining three quarters of the year. so is that how we should view your base business earnings power or are you still spending more through the year from some of the covid testing profits or being conservative? would love just any additional color on the base business earnings power ex testing?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yeah, matt, i'll take that. this is bob. so we don't really think about earnings or at the bottom line base versus covid. we manage the whole company.
obviously the first quarter is benefiting from the majority of the global sales that we've got forecasted at this point in time, kind of our starting point. but we funded our growth throughout the rest of the quarter. so what you have is covid testing, initial covid testing sales in that for first quarter, but our investments throughout the entire year. and so as we update our covid testing each quarter, kind of, as robert robert talked about, that will fall through certainly at a higher level than our overall margin profile.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd just add on to that, matt, we absolutely expect there to be covid testing after the first quarter. the question is at what level? and as i said in the beginning, to be able to kind of forecast a full year out like that, given the magnitude of how this can shift, it's just prudent to do it a quarter at a time. so when we're here in april, we'll have a better sense of what q2 is going to look like in terms of covid testing, and we'll be able to kind of update you there.
matt taylor -- ubs -- analyst
can i just ask one follow up? so on gross margin, you mentioned that it was about $500 million headwind from inflation supply chain. and so i guess if we add that back in to getting to gross margins closer to 60%, ex that. i was just wondering if you could talk about expectations for gross margins going forward longer term, if things normalize and if you could kind of see those levels in 2023, if things improve or just pluses and minuses on gross margins longer term.
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
matt, i think the ad-back hits you a little bit below that. but the way we think about gross margin every year is looking for ways to expand that. every one of our businesses has dedicated teams focused on gross margin initiatives, and you're seeing some of that benefit actually in our 2022 forecast, helping to offset the impact of the inflation that we're seeing. we continue those programs that are not a one year program.
we do them every year and we'll continue to those into next year. the other thing we're seeing is a benefit of kind of the business mix. so as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing recovers, that benefits our overall gross margin for the business. obviously, robert talked about a lot of the opportunity, some of the opportunities, even more that we have to drive growth in our medical device business as well as in diagnostics.
and as we grow those businesses that will have a positive impact overall on our gross margin profile.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. let me let me wrap up here then. thanks, bob. listen, i'll finish by saying a little bit how i started.
acknowledge that there's a lot of uncertainties in the macro environment right now and the challenges that creates in terms of, you know, in terms of forecasting for investors, at least in the short term, the pandemic, how long will it last, phases, transition to endemic, recovery curves of procedures. i get some of the challenges of that forecast. but if i look at the market here at the start of the year and look at healthcare sectors, specifically medtech and diagnostics, definitely been disproportionately hit by some of those uncertainties. and i think if you take a step back, i think it's important to remind ourselves the healthcare still remains a very, very important need and a great long-term growth area because i think none of the long-term market fundamentals have changed in the pandemic.
if anything, some of them have gotten even better and accelerated. so i think the demographic trends are are still very favorable and procedures and routine routine testing, they're going to come back, whether it's a month, two months, etc. it's just difficult to predict with perfect degree of precision, but they'll come back. and if you look at the innovation pipelines across the entire industry, they have never been stronger.
and within that context, i think abbott's pretty uniquely positioned here. we're in great markets, leading positions in several large, fast-growing segments diabetes devices, diagnostics, including covid testing, nutrition, emerging market pharma. we have strong positions, brands, franchises across all of these, so. and it's one of the questions i think we're leading in the digital transformation that's going to be more patient-centric care, whether it's with by wearables, whether it's connected devices, remote monitoring, etc.
and and then you layer that diversification that i talked about in my opening comments, which i think is very unique, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and it does provide a natural hedge to some of these macro environment impacts that we're going to see from time to time. and that diversity is not just on the business mix, but customers, payor types, obviously geographic footprint, and a very strong and resilient supply chain. so you translate all that into real strong, sustainable strategic financial health, whether it's growing revenues, cash flows, dividends, we've got a rock solid balance sheet. i talked about the opportunities that we have with it.
so i think we're in a really good position strategically, financially, and i'm excited about all the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us. so with that, i'll wrap it up and i'll thank everybody for joining us today.

good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [operator instructions] with the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by abbott.
it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission. i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing and acquisition.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, chairman and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we will take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1-a, risk factors, to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. with that, i will now turn the call over to robert. 
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, we reported another strong quarter and highly successful year for abbott. for the year, we reported organic sales growth of 23% and ongoing earnings per share of $5.21, which reflects more than 40% growth compared to the prior year, and exceeded the original eps guidance we set last january.
these last couple of years have truly been unique on many levels. the challenge throughout the pandemic has been the sheer breadth of its impacts, and for abbott, it's reinforced the value of our diversified business model, which is uniquely balanced across multiple dimensions, including our business mix, customer, and peer types, innovation cycles across our businesses, and geographic footprint. we've always said that our business model allows us more opportunities to win during the good times, and makes us more resilient during the tough times. never has this been put to the test more so than over the past couple of years.
it's been tested by a major global pandemic. it was proven to be highly resilient, delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders. covid testing has been a big part of this, of course. we delivered a billion test last year and approximately 300 million in the fourth quarter alone, and continue to play a significant role in the world's response to the pandemic.
but just as importantly, we demonstrated abbott's strength across our company, delivering strong growth across our businesses while we continue to expand our portfolio with innovations that will fuel our success for years to come regardless of the pandemic situation. turning to our outlook for 2022, as we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $4.70 cents, which reflects nearly 50% growth compared to our pre-pandemic baseline in 2019. we forecast organic sales growth for our base business, excluding covid tests, in the high single digits. and our guidance includes an initial covid testing sales forecast of $2.5 billion.
we're seeing very strong demand for testing to start the year with the recent emergence of the omicron variant. and as you know, forecasting covid testing demand for more than a few months at a time has been challenging. therefore, our initial forecasts compromise a sales that we expect to occur in the early part of the year, and we'll update this forecast one quarter at a time over the remainder of the year. i'll now provide more details on our 2021 results before turning the call over to bob.
and i'll start with nutrition, where sales grew nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 7.5% for the year. adult nutrition delivered 9% growth for the quarter and double-digit growth for the year, led once again by ensure, our market leading, complete and balanced nutrition brand, and glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand. in pediatric nutrition, u.s. sales growth of more than 10% for the year was led by strong growth of pedialyte, our oral rehydration brand, and market share gains for similac, our market-leading infant formula brand.
during the past year, we continue to expand our nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the launch of similac 360 total care in the u.s. and continued global expansion of our pediasure, glucerna and ensure brands with line extensions such as plant-based, lower sugar, and high-protein products. turning to medical devices. our continued recovery from the impacts of the pandemic and strong growth in diabetes care drove sales growth of 16% in the quarter and nearly 20% for the year.
in diabetes care, sales growth of nearly 30% for both the fourth quarter and full year was led by freestyle libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. libre's sales grew over 35%, which translates to year-over-year growth of $1 billion to a total of $3.7 billion in 2021. this past year, we continue to strengthen our medical device portfolio with several pipeline advancements and launches. in the u.s., expanded medicare reimbursement coverage for mitraclip will make it possible for more people to benefit from this life-changing technology.
we launch new neurosphere virtual clinic, a first of its kind technology that lets patients communicate with physicians and receive new treatment settings remotely. we received u.s. fda approval for our amplatzer or amulet heart device, which treats people with atrial fibrillation, who are who are at risk of ischemic stroke. and we received u.s.
fda approval of our [inaudible] heart valve replacement system for people with severe aortic stenosis, and ce mark for navitor, our latest generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement system. moving to established pharmaceuticals, or epd, where sales increased nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. strong performance was broad based across several countries, led by india, russia, and china. epd has performed well throughout the pandemic, fueled by strong execution and a steady flow of new product introductions in our core therapeutic areas.
i'll wrap up with diagnostics, where covid testing was a big part of the story, but far from all of it. covid testing sales were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including binaxnow in the u.s., panbio internationally, and id now globally, compromising approximately 90% of those sales. demand for testing continues to remain strong, and we remain committed to help ensure broad access. since the start of the pandemic, we've invested significantly to build both u.s.
and international manufacturing supply chains, and we're working to expand our capacity further to meet global demand. excluding covid testing sales, worldwide diagnostic sales grew over 8% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. we continue to roll out alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across our platforms. during the year, we placed more than 3,000 alinity instruments for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing, with approximately two-thirds of those placements coming from share capture.
and in molecular diagnostics, excluding covid testing, sales grew double digits in both u.s. and internationally as we continue the rollout of our alinity instrument for molecular testing. so in summary, 2021 was another highly successful year for abbott. we continue to play a vital role in combating covid-19 as a result of our massive scale we built in rapid testing capacity.
all four of our major businesses delivered strong performance this past year and are well positioned for continued success going forward. and we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of important new products from our pipeline and several attractive growth areas. i'll now turn over the call to bob. bob?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. turning to our results. sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global covid testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter.
excluding covid testing sales, organic sales growth was 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 10.8% compared to our pre-pandemic baseline in the fourth quarter of 2019. foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on fourth quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter. regarding other aspects of the p&l for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.7% of sales, adjusted r&d investment was 6.3% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense was 26.2% of sales. our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 16.9%, which reflects an adjustment to align our tax rate for the first three quarters of last year with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15.5%, which is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in october due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.
turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. today, we issued guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $4.7. for the year, we forecast organic sales growth, excluding the impact of covid testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. we forecast covid testing-related sales of approximately $2.5 billion, with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the early part of the year.
we'll update our covid testing sales forecast one quarter at a time throughout the year. based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our reported sales. we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 58.5% of sales for the year, which reflects our forecasted business mix, underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses, along with the impact of inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution cost. for the year, we forecast r&d investment of around $2.7 billion and sg&a expense of around $10.8 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives.
we forecast net interest expense of around $500 million, non-operating income of around $375 million, and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14.5% for the year. turning to our outlook for the first quarter. we forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50 and organic sales growth, excluding the impact of covid testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. lastly, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from robbie marcus from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. and congrats on a good quarter. maybe to start for robert or bob, you guys put up a good first quarter being on covid testing sales had double-digit growth in most of the businesses.
i was hoping maybe you can reconcile the strong 1q and the reiterated guidance and walk us through some of the puts and takes and how to think about bridging the difference?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, robbie. i think you've been on these calls for a while. we rarely raised in q1, i would say. and despite that, i mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out.
and there's a lot of good things going on at the company. we talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments. we've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there. . epd execution is going very well, like i said in the comments, three out of four quarters, double digit, strong covid sales, both in the us and internationally.
i think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too. talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products. bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow. we're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business.
so there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening. first of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the fda. and we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, etc. so it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts.
we're working closely with the fda, but i see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the fda then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share. probably the second other part here, which is i think is a little bit not unique to abbott. and i think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in january, and it's gotten a little bit more challenging. and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, etc., to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year.
so that being said, i wanted to see how these -- probably these two points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after q2. but like i said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business. devices performing very well. diagnostics performing very well.
the parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well. i'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but i think in the context of how the business is performing, i mean if you exclude the covid piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11%. and i think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution. so in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as bob said, more fx headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall.
so i think it's the right eps guide right now in terms of where we are after q1.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. really good color. and maybe as a follow-up, i think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that january and february weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated omicron levels. so we heard johnson & johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-covid volume levels in april.
it sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter. i was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? and how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? thanks a lot.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think the storyline here was very similar, as i said in my comments. i mean, it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in january, obviously, given omicron and the surges there and the pressure that that put-on staff at hospitals. but definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, march was very strong.
i've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist. if you look at our q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 7.3%. so well ahead of where we were in 2019. and that was pretty broad-based.
geographically, the us was up 6%, again versus 2019. and international was up over 8% versus 2019, too. so i think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter. the cardiovascular side has done very well as i've kind of given those numbers, and march was really strong, too.
i think it's -- part of it is recovery, robbie, that we're seeing. but also -- i would also put in those numbers, i made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year. it's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that covid environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's amulet, navitor in europe, cardiomems, the rollout of ensite x that began in q4 of last year, our triclip product. so i think all of that, it's the combination, i would say, of both recovery as the covid cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, i'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
appreciate the color. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right. the testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right? that's perhaps $0.40 of upside and reiteration of the eps, like what is offsetting the incremental tailwind from covid rate? like how much of this is fx, was this macro-russia versus the recall or inflationary pressures, i think, a little bit more granularity will be helpful.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, i mean, i think you hit on the key points there. i mean, inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that. we've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution.
the recall -- well, let me take a step back, the fx is probably about another about $0.05 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly. we've got a couple of different scenarios, as i said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve. so we are seeing more covid tests and more covid sales. and that, like i said, is absorbing some of these challenges.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then, one on libre. sequentially, your revenue has declined. and i guess my question is you've been adding, i think, a couple of hundred thousand new patients starts.
is that new patient starts changing at all? how should we think about the incremental reimbursement in japan? and was the seasonality or what drove the sequential libre revenue trends?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think we see some of that from time to time here, especially as you go from q4 to q1, vijay. we've seen that a couple of times. i'd say internationally, the biggest driver of that is actually fx that created that.
we've seen good growth internationally from libre getting close to 20% on a very large base. and in the us, you're going to see some timing patterns there in terms of wholesaler ordering. i like to look at scripts, both new-to-brand scripts and total rx scripts here in the us and the sequential q1 to q4, there's definitely growth there. so i think we've done a really good job in the us we've grown our business in this quarter by 50%.
users now well over 1 million users. we've made the investments in the us, whether it's salesforce, dtc advertising. i think the team is beginning to hit its stride over there. they know that i'm not satisfied.
we always want to see more and believe that we can do more. but i think the us is starting to kind of really hit its stride with those investments as the sales force gets deployed and establishes the relationships with what is new physicians that are getting introduced to cgm. so i think that's worked out very well. if i take a step back, though, and move away a little bit from the rxs and the sequential, i think one of the key things here to really take a look at is the evolution of the cgm market.
and i'm starting to really see now what we had always envisioned this market to start to be, which is a market that is shifting from what traditionally was more of a type one, more of a pumper -- insulin pump kind of connectivity play, which is an important segment, but really start to move and expand beyond that. and we're starting to see signs of that. and i think libre is a big driver. the value proposition of libre is a big driver, whether it's physicians and payers, quite frankly, starting to see the value of the sensing technology across a much broader set of patients.
if you look at a us base of patients, and we get to see this because we get to see the rx data in terms of what medications the patients are using. and over 40% of our user base, which is pretty large in the us, is already type two non-intensive. and that, as i said, is really kind of an opportunity to expand this market and become a really strong growth driver. the japan reimbursement that you just referenced, again, this goes back to a comment i made about.
we see this as a mass market opportunity. so counter to maybe how we think about reimbursement in different segments of devices where you're thinking about price of reimbursement versus patient tam, we're looking at patient tam much more than we are on the pricing side. we've got great reimbursement in japan, but to be able to have access to all insulin users in japan with our product is a great opportunity for us. and then, you're seeing the value proposition, again, really strong.
there was a study that was published by uk nice. and i think that, for me, is the ultimate validation of our strategy and the value proposition we offer where it was clearly shown to be extremely cost effective, whether you look at icers or qualys in the uk by nice and their view here of how this can benefit a lot of patients. so that for me is the real exciting part of libre is we're really starting to see that evolution from the cgm market to become much more than kind of a niche play and much more mass-market play. and i think we're starting to see evidence of that, whether it's new studies or reimbursement access or even seeing physicians primary care docs start to really embrace the prescription of cgm for type twos, so.

thank you. our next question comes from josh jennings from cowen. your line is open.
josh jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a strong start to the year. rob and bob, i just wanted to start with just a question on gross margins.
the 1q performance was the highest since 20 -- quarters in 2019. just wanted to better understand the sustainability of this profile? 59.1% despite all the challenges in place in 1q, and then -- and should investors be thinking that return to 2019 gross margin levels in that 59% range plus is achievable in the out years? and follow-up is on mitraclip. i just wanted to hear -- and amulet, what have you learned in the early days, the amulet launched as the no. 2 player in the us left atrial appendage closure market that you can apply to your defense strategy starting this year, maybe carrying into next year when you're defending your mitraclip turf as the no.
1 player, assuming the u.s past the launch occurs in 2023?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
ok. josh, i'll take the kind of the gross margin question. in the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high covid testing sales. as i mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that.
so our first quarter definitely benefited from that. as we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that robert mentioned. obviously, inflation is not unique to us. as we said back in january, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time.
and what we've seen, and i think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds. and so, we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year. when i think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, i mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly. we've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements.
i mean, a lot's going to depend, i think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component. and then, obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company. and so, that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. on your question on mitraclip and amulet, so i'll talk a little bit about mitraclip. i'd say the progression of mitraclip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? so we obviously had high covid case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth toward the end of february and into march. so as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate.
but i'll tell you, i mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, josh, i don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the fmr indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of covid. and as part of that, and i talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from coapt, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks. and we began doing that when covid took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when delta and omicron served. so i'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while.
relating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead. we've got to keep on investing in the product. so we've done that with mitraclip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product. we're investing in new trials.
i talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients. that will be a great opportunity for us. and we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position. so not discounting the fact that we'll have competition.
we've had competition in europe for a couple of years already. germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share. so i acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market. so that's what i would talk about mitraclip.
i still think the best is still to come because i don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the fmr indication. regarding amulet, listen, i think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter. and that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored. so difficult to move proctors throughout the us and travel international, etc.
so that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year. but i'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in february and march. and the team has definitely had a really strong exit to q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in q1. so i think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product.
and once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure. and that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism. so there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the aacc, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter. and even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events.
so i think we're in a good position now with amulet. i'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow. i think momentum is building with amulet.
josh jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks so much for all that color. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so robert, two high-level questions for me. one, i'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023.
you're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year. so how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? and i have one follow-up.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, larry. and i think to answer your question, i think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the us and internationally. in the us, we saw cases decline pretty significantly in february.
but i think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available. so i think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state. and as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking. so -- and i think our product has done really well here.
it's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the us, even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, etc. so i think that that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue? and i would say, yes, it does continue. one portion that doesn't get a lot of attention is our international testing business. 50% of our sales in march of covid tests came from the international markets.
and i'd say, similar sense there of governments investing in testing and coming to abbott as one of the preferred suppliers. so i think that to answer your question, obviously, there's a certain amount that you can't overcome, right? but i do think that as we go into next year, we'll have a portion of our testing business that will look more like a flu kind of respiratory kind of endemic state. and i think that's going to be important as we continue to grow earnings. and then, on top of that, like i said, the focus of our medical device business, the investments we've made in our diagnostic systems and increasing the test menus over there.
so i expect our base business to continue to grow very strongly. yes, it's a little bit early regarding 2023, but we are planning. we are looking. we are looking at where we're going to be able to kind of grow and i'd say there will be some covid business next year.
i think we're in probably the strongest position to be able to kind of capitalize and lead in that market. and then, our base business is going to do very strongly next year with all the investments we've made and new product pipeline that we've got.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's super helpful. and robert, you're in a unique position with your strong balance sheet. i saw you mentioned on the call, you bought back, i think, $2.5 billion in stock this quarter. what are your updated thoughts on m&a? and if you can't find attractive assets, are you going to continue to return cash to shareholders like we saw this past quarter? thank you.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. on the m&a side, yeah. i mean, i'll sound like a broken record here, larry. i mean, we're always looking.
we're always studying. we're always looking at ways to be able to add to the company and add to our business, but it needs to be strategic. and from that perspective, i don't want to dilute our growth rate. i don't want to dilute our profiles.
we need to make sure that we're looking at assets that will be additive to our growth into our profile. so at least the top line. so that's always there, and we're always looking. regarding the approach, listen, it's always a balanced approach, larry.
we're generating strong cash flow. we got a lot of financial flexibility here. we'll return $3 billion when you -- in terms of dividend this year, bob talked about what we've done regarding buybacks. and we're always going to look at this kind of balanced approach.
we've made investments in our organic opportunities for growth because i believe that those are great returns for our shareholders, whether it's libre, mitraclip, expansion of our medical devices, diagnostics, those are all opportunities that deliver great returns for our shareholders, and we'll take that balanced approach. and if there is an opportunity for more, we'll do more.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks so much, robert.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joanne wuensch from citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good morning and thank you very much for taking the question. i'd like to circle back a little bit to the nutritional business. a lot of the feedback that i get from investors is some level of concern regarding brand name, brand damage, if you will. and i'm curious your thoughts on what it would take to sort of revamp this business up? thank you.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sorry, you're referring to nutrition business?
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
yes.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. listen, we've got a very robust manufacturing network and a robust quality system. obviously, there's a shortage of product in the market. i highlighted some of the things that we're doing to be able to kind of resupply the market.
a key aspect of that is going to be the restart, and we're in that process. we've got a strong brand with similac. we've maintained a lot of contracts. we've been able to supply those contracts even with a little bit of this shortage.
so i feel confident in our team's ability here to look at once we get restarted to be able to resupply the market and build back our share. we had just launched a new product last year -- end of last year with a blend of five hmos and that's a significant advancement. and we were expecting that based on everything that we had studied and seen was going to be a big growth driver for us and kind of brand enhancers. so i think that's going to be important.
and yes, we'll have to make some investments as we go back to the market. but i'd say historically, when some of these issues have happened in the past, whether it's abbott or other manufacturers, share does recover. the question is just kind of the timing and the curve of that recovery, but share do come to recover, and you can look at past situations with other competitors and even with us.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you. and as a follow-up, forgive me for asking it this way. what's next? i mean, i don't think we're going to be talking about covid testing in a year. i hope we're not going to be talking about it.
but how do you see the sort of forward momentum of the company, big picture? thanks.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, yeah, i don't think we're going to be talking about covid testing the way we're talking about it today or how we talked about it in the past year. but like i told larry, i mean, i do think that there's going to be an opportunity for covid testing to play a role in this kind of endemic state. and as i've said in the past also, what covid has allowed us to do is to further accelerate what we believe was a key trend in diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics, which is the expansion and the decentralization of that testing outside of the lab into pharmacies, into people's homes and it being connected.
so i think that -- covid has accelerated that, i guess, i would say. and we're obviously building menus where we'll be able to add to the id now instrument, more panels, more different tests. remember, when we started the pandemic, we had about 20,000 kind of instruments that's now fivefold in terms of the opportunity that we have to be able to expand menu into basically an asset that's been capitalized and deployed into the market. so that's what we've been working on from that perspective on the, i guess, i would say, on the rapid testing side on the decentralized testing side.
i'd say going back to the device portfolio, i mean there's still a lot of what next in our pipeline of products that we've just launched that are still in the early innings here. one of them that we got approved this quarter, which i'm really excited about, is aveir and our leadless pacemaker. i think this is going to be a great opportunity to kind of reignite growth back in our crm business. i mean, we've seen an improvement already with the existing portfolio and had a 4% growth this quarter.
but i think aveir is a real kind of game changer for our crm portfolio. obviously, the single chamber is a smaller part of the market. we know that it's about 15%. but i think when you're coming second to the market, you get to observe what needs to -- what could be addressed that maybe the first generation didn't do.
and i think that our product whether it's retrievability, its ability to be retrieved, it's longer-lasting battery. right now, it's about two times product that's on the market. but i think what's really exciting about this is its ability to upgrade to a dual chamber device. so it's upgradability is what we're hearing extremely big interest from the physician community.
so i think that's a great opportunity for us that i think is really going to start to show as we evolve our trial for dual chamber and begin to collect data there. i think that's going to be a great opportunity for our crm portfolio. i look at cardiomems as another great opportunity that we have just really just started. the expanded indication is going to really open up the market.
i've seen some of the implant trends that we've seen post-expansion indication, and that gives me a lot of excitement about what this product can be. we talked about amulet. i think that the tavr piece is one that, as i've said in the past, we're investing. i think navitor is an extremely competitive product, and we're seeing that in europe as we've launched it and been six months in the market now.
so there's great opportunities over there. libre 3 is an opportunity for us, not only in the us, but in europe to continue to expand the market. i think lingo, as i said in the last call, is another great opportunity that is really in the early stages. but look at using our bio-wearable sensors outside of diabetes and looking at opportunities there.
so i think we have a lot of what next that are truly early in their early stages. and then, on top of all the products that we've been talking about right now also. so i'm excited about the what next.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from travis steed from bank of america. your line is open.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the questions. curious on the inflation supply chain, sounds like it's gotten about $200 million worse than the $500 million you had built into the p&l, just to confirm that. i'm curious what you're seeing the biggest pain points? is it wages, raw materials, shipping costs and expectations on when that could start to ease to some degree? or how you're thinking for a potential offset with price?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
yes. travis, i'll take the question. this is bob. so as we said back in january, we did incorporate a sizable impact into our 2022 guidance, which was about $500 million on the gross margin line.
and as robert mentioned, we've now incorporated an additional $200 million in gross margin impact in our current guidance. the biggest impact we're seeing is really on logistics and commodities and some other manufacturing inputs. it's not so much on the labor front. labor is a smaller portion of our total product cost.
so it's really on the commodities. in terms of when this will ease and change, i mean, that's a very -- i think there's a lot of things that affect that and where the -- where inflation may go. we do know that historically, on commodities, we do see cycles. we do see commodity costs go up, but they also come down.
and we would expect at some point, and it's very difficult to kind of call exactly when that will be, we will see some of the inflationary pressures subside.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then given your presence in china, i would just kind of love to hear your thoughts on both china from a procedure standpoint and also a supply chain standpoint, just given how much of the business you have there? and any thoughts on the progress you're making with libre 3 and the fda would be great too. thank you.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i think regarding china, i saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where it started off pretty well in the quarter. and then, as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in shanghai toward the end of february and into march, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures. we look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy.
so we saw those go down also during the month of april -- during the month of march. and i'd say, over the last two weeks in april, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing. so i think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of pcr testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing. but we're starting to see that now probably two solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction.
still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there. so i would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures. and not all procedures are the same. some of them return faster.
some of them have a different kind of recovery curve. but i do expect kind of the impact that we saw in march and a little bit in the beginning of april and devices start to kind of improve. sorry, you had a question on libre 3?
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, libre 3. any update on how the progress is working with the fda or what the label might look like? just any additional color would be great. thank you.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. like i mentioned in the call, we filed as an icgm. i don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that. i will say that we have moved libre 3 in europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from libre 2 to libre 3.
and i think the process started really well in germany. we got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also. and that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in libre 3. we did that in libre 2 also when we moved from libre 1 to libre 2 in germany.
that took us about a year. i think it's going to be faster than that with libre 3. and we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for libre 3 in germany. so that's now moved into high gear, not only in germany, but for the rest of the year.
so i'm focused a lot on what we can do with libre in the countries that we do have it approved. and right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
ok. operator, we'll take one more question.
operator
thank you. our last question will come from matt miksic from credit suisse. your line is open.
matt miksic -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. thanks so much. just in the context of some of these new products, i did want to maybe follow up with just a level set expectation, for example, the avidity rollout and menu expansion, very strong growth in the quarter. robert, if you could maybe talk about what's the duration of this rollout? i know it started into the pandemic.
and what does that look like through this year and potentially through next year? and then i know you touched this a few times here about amulet. just love to get your updated thoughts on where you think share could go in the next year, 18 months? you've made some comments in q4. i know the pace is picking up here in the us? any numbers you could put around your thoughts there would be super helpful.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, alinity is a multiyear strategy and rollout here, matt. we're doing it not only with immunoassay, we're doing with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology. we're doing it with transfusion.
this has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems. so i think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between seven to 10 years. so on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an rfp. so regarding its legs like you're asking, i mean, i still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here.
the covid pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the covid. but i guess what i would say is there's plenty more to come. the key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for rfp, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain. and i think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well.
so i'd say, nine out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain. and then, if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, i'd say our win rate here is over 50%. so when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth. and then, once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? you've got the capital deployed; you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there.
so everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, etc., is accretive from both the top and the bottom line. so that's a big focus of the team on the r&d side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what i would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems. so amulet -- on your question on amulet, listen, i think we continue to capture share. we estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the us longer term, i would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position.
the european market is much smaller than the us market. in that market, we have a 50 share. so i think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology. we believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted.
so you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system. and from there, you build off there. so i think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts. and that's the piece that i'm actually getting very excited about it.
as we've looked at the accounts that we started back in september and october, we're starting to see nice share movement over there. so that's very exciting for us. so let me just close here. i think we've had a very strong start to the year, like i said in my prepared comments.
we've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in january, absorbing, i would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart. other parts and attrition are doing very well, and i expect them to continue to do very well. we're absorbing, as bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies i know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on fx side. that being said, there's a lot of great things that are going on at abbott in the company, a lot of positives.
i talked about them in the beginning of the call. and i expect all of that positive to continue and to that momentum to continue to build on that business. like i said, excluding covid, excluding some of the recall products, our base business grew 11% in the quarter and the team is focused on building off that and building off that momentum. so, thanks.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] this call is being recorded by abbott. with the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by abbott.
it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbot's expressed written permission. i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing, and acquisitions.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
good morning and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, chairman and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we will take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a risk factors to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with the comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. note that abbott has not provided the gaap financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis, because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert.

thanks, scott. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, we reported results of another strong quarter. earnings per share were $1.73, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year.
sales increased 17.5% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in medical devices, established pharmaceuticals as well as diagnostics, both with and without covid testing-related sales. in addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas. i'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to bob. and i'll start with established pharmaceuticals, or epd, where sales increased 13.5% in the quarter.
epd has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in three of the last four quarters. strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries and core therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, respiratory and cns pain management. turning to nutrition, where our performance was mixed. our adult nutrition business continues to perform at a high level with global organic sales growth of 11.5%, led by our ensure and glucerna brands.
and we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market leading pediasure and pedialyte brands. as you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in february of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our us facilities. it's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers. testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both abbott and the fda have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses.
importantly, the fda and cdc found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in non-product contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination. and lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the fda ruled out any link to our facility. we hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products. we know the situation has further exacerbated industrywide infant formula supply shortages.
that's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our fda-registered facility in europe and ramping up production at our other us plants. and of course, we're working very closely with the fda on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility. moving to diagnostics, where sales grew 35%. covid test sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, more than 90% of which came from our rapid test, including binaxnow in the us, panbio internationally and id now globally.
excluding covid-related -- covid testing-related sales, our global diagnostics sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the continued rollout of alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms. and i'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 11.5% in the quarter. this strong performance was led by double-digit growth in diabetes care, structural heart, heart failure and electrophysiology. in diabetes care, sales of freestyle libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally.
in cardiovascular devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated covid case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into april. in addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline. in the us, we received fda approval for aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms. in japan, expanded reimbursement for libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day.
cardiomems received an expanded indication in the us to treat more patients suffering from earlier stages of heart failure. and we received us fda clearance for the latest generation of our ensite x system, which provides a 360-degree view of the heart for improved cardiac mapping. so in summary, we're achieving strong growth overall and across several areas of our business. as the first quarter progressed and covid levels decreased, we saw a steady improvement in the hospital-based procedure trends, which has continued into april.
and we continue to advance our pipeline with new products, indications and reimbursement coverage in several attractive growth areas. i'll now turn over the call to bob. bob?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. turning to our results. sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% on an organic basis, which was led by double-digit growth in diagnostics, medical devices and established pharmaceuticals along with global covid testing-related sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter.
excluding covid testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 7.7% versus the prior year. foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on first quarter sales. during the quarter, we saw the us dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in january. regarding other aspects of the p&l, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.1% of sales, which reflects higher than normal fall-through on covid testing sales as a result of significant production volumes during the first quarter, partially offset by the impacts of the nutrition recall and somewhat higher-than-expected inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter.
adjusted research and development investment was 5.6% of sales and adjusted sg&a investment was 23.1% of sales in the first quarter. lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%. before discussing our outlook for the full year, i want to provide an update on our strategic capital deployment initiatives completed in the first quarter, which included approximately $2.3 billion of share repurchases, $800 million of dividends, scheduled debt repayment of $750 million and $300 million of capital expenditures, which support future organic growth opportunities. we continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the flexibility required to execute a well-balanced capital allocation strategy.
turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. our adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $4.70 remains unchanged. we now forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of covid testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits, which is somewhat lower than our prior forecast of high single digits due to the recent recall event in nutrition. it is important to note, excluding sales impacted by the recall, we continue to forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, excluding the impact of testing-related sales and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the recall.
we forecast covid testing-related sales of approximately $4.5 billion with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the first half of the year. we continue to -- we'll continue to update our covid testing-related sales forecast one quarter at a time throughout the year as appropriate. lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 3% on our full year reported sales. with that, we'll now open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from robbie marcus from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. robert, maybe to start -- maybe i'll get a little greedy here since we're only sitting in july, and half of '22 is done. but i think the focus for investors is quickly shifting to next year, and there's a lot of moving pieces going on in 2022, a lot of assumptions we have to make in the go forward of 2023.
where is covid testing? how fast does nutrition come back? and how steady can the device business be going forward? so there's a lot of uncertainty out there of where numbers should sit and how to start thinking about the business for next year. any thoughts you have at this point would be really helpful.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, i think there's a lot of uncertainty for everybody regarding 2023. i think you've kind of highlighted some of the aspects as it relates to our business here. but the macro environment still is pretty challenging, and i don't think it's unique to us.
obviously, there's significant inflation, and seems like there's a pretty significant, call it, a commodity super cycle for us. there's healthcare staffing challenges, you hear about that. and then, obviously, a strong u.s. dollar.
so all those kind of combinations are the challenges that a lot of companies are going to face. and if you look at a lot of the financial and consumer indicators, retail, housing, auto, etc., those tend to point toward an increased risk here of recession. so what i would say is, historically, in that macro environment, healthcare has proven to be pretty resilient. and whether it's the durability of these essential procedures and products, i mean, you can only defer them somewhat.
a large portion of the healthcare spend is government-funded, and we've got a diversified model that's proved itself to be very resilient in this kind of environment. so at a macro level, i think those are the headwinds that we're all facing and we'll all be facing. you mentioned covid as a factor here. it's interesting.
last year at this time, we were talking about how covid would -- covid testing would move away, but we've actually shipped just as an amount of tests in the first six months of this year compared to all of last year. so i think that we're going to need to see how the cases evolve, robbie, especially during the winter and fall months over here. and obviously, i don't think it's prudent to forecast a winter surge. but like i said, we've got capacity to be able to deal with that.
so those are some of the key factors here that we're looking at. nutrition that you mentioned, we're recovering pretty nicely, i would say, versus where we originally thought we were going to be back in april. a lot of focus on restarting the manufacturing site. we've recovered already a good portion of the share that we lost.
and obviously, we continue to see that moving forward positively. so on the flip side, though, what i would say is that we're not going to just sit still over the next couple of months and wait for these macro kind of factors here to play out, right? we're taking a very proactive approach on the elements that we can control and that we can impact. we're taking price where we can, and we've seen that in our consumer base businesses. these are businesses, because of the strength of our brands, that we've been able to do that and pass it on.
we're also looking at other areas that we can -- or that historically, we haven't necessarily looked at in terms of price. we're looking at our cost structure. i talked about this in previous calls, too, and we've got a program in place now where we're looking at our cost structure. the hurdles in terms of investment have obviously increased given this macro environment.
we're not going to put any risk to our long-term growth platforms, but we're definitely looking at our cost structure and see where we can improve. and the inventory is important, as we move into this inflationary period here. so we're ensuring that we've got the right amount of inventory. so i put all that together, robbie.
we've got macro headwinds that everybody else has. regarding nutrition, i think our performance is well aligned to where we planned and where i see us ending up end of the year is ultimately where our forecast -- the forecast that we laid out. covid testing is one that, to simply assume, that there won't be any covid testing next year. we've never believed that.
the question is just your ability to forecast beyond three to six months, that's the challenge. so fundamentally, i think our business remains very strong. we've got leading positions in attractive long-term growth markets, strong pipeline, and i'm sure we'll talk about some of that today also. we've got a lot of ongoing, upcoming launch activity and a strong balance sheet that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility.
so it's difficult to pin a number on it right now, robbie. but at a high level, those are the elements that we're working with and, ultimately, like to see some of these elements play out over the next couple of months here.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. maybe just as a follow-up to that, robert. you were talking about the cost structure at abbott, and this is something we're hearing from basically everyone, that inflation, supply chain, etc. you're in this enviable position where you've probably grown operating margins more than anyone else in medtech since the start of covid.
a lot of that has been from the benefit of covid testing sales, which are at healthy margins and still healthy reinvestment against that. so as we think about your operating margins going forward and you reevaluating your cost base here, i just -- it's a difficult question and it's been a while for medtech investors to see anything but just margins going straight up. so how do you want investors to start thinking about where your base operating margin is maybe potentially of covid testing sales slowdown in the future?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i always appreciate you like to get at the next year's number in a couple of different ways, robbie. i guess, i would say on the cost structure piece, i don't necessarily fully agree with you, the way you characterized it in terms of covid being the ultimate driver here. i think we made a lot of progress on our gross margins historically, whether it was in devices and in nutrition.
so as the device business continues to grow, that profile of that business is accretive, and you've seen our growth rates in that business over these last couple of years. so that helps the margin. our biggest challenge, i would say, from a gross margin perspective is really on the inflation side. yes, we're seeing input cost go up probably more on the commodity side, so impacting epd, impacting nutrition, less so, i would say, in devices and diagnostics.
yes, there's some noise that happens here with one supplier -- another supplier, and we deal with it. but the real challenge we've had, i would say, over the last kind of six months here has been on the nutrition side. and part of that is -- some of it is commodities. so we're going to have to see how those look like over the next kind of couple of months, seeing some slowing down of some commodities, but that's the biggest kind of driver there.
but the other part of the nutrition is, i would say, cost that i don't anticipate to be there next year. so for example, we're paying wic rebates for competitive products since april -- actually, since march when we initiated the recall. and as we restart production in the facility, i don't assume that that will continue. i made statements in my opening comments about bringing product in from overseas.
we brought a lot of formula from overseas, and that's all airfreight. and you know the story on freight and distribution. so once that facility starts up and running, i don't anticipate to see those same kind of freight expenses from overseas shipments. and we put some money toward brand recovery.
and i think that that was an investment that's necessary to get our share back in position that we need as we go into next year. so that being said, as i said, we're going to look at our cost structure. we're going to look at areas that have a higher hurdle now for passing an investment hypothesis or thesis, and we're going to -- we'll take action where we need to take action. so that's how i'd characterize our margin.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. appreciate the thoughts. thanks a lot.
operator
and our next question comes from joshua jennings from cowen. your line is now open, sir.
joshua jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i was hoping to start with a follow-up on the raise of the 2022 eps guidance floor and just better understand the puts and takes.
i think there are some questions around the $0.30 beat in 2q and the $0.20 increase, again, realizing that it is a floor. but it seems like a lot of that kind of guess $0.10 delta is driven by the move in the u.s. dollar in july. but just wanted to better understand the puts and takes and how you guys arrived at the increase that you did.
i have one follow-up.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yes. i think you'll see -- i mean, we've seen a lot of companies kind of beat their q2 and either maintain their guidance for the full year or actually reduce it. and we looked at our numbers very carefully, and we basically looked at the strength of our base business.
so if you exclude an, our nutrition -- the parts of the nutrition business that was recalled, we're growing high single digits, and we continue to see that kind of growth rate going forward. so between the strength of the base business and the covid sales, we then felt that we had enough power here to navigate and push through some of these macro headwinds that are pretty significant, right? inflation is a big element there. we had some costs. when we gave initial guidance in january, we increased that in our april call.
and we've assumed another couple of hundred million dollars of inflation since that number that we provided in april. so that's one element that we're absorbing, i guess. the, what i would call, healthcare staffing challenges, covid cancellations, the lockdown issues that we saw in q2, especially, i'd say, on our core lab business and ep in china, for example, those are being absorbed also. and then currency, as you referenced, pretty dramatic strengthening here of the u.s.
dollar. so we've assumed all of that. and as i said also to robbie, we've had to factor in some additional costs on the nutrition side, whether it's the wic rebate, the freight, and distribution, some of the investments we're making to support share recovery. so you put those two together -- those two elements together on the macro on nutrition side and then you offset that with our base business and covid sales, and those -- that's really the element there, josh.
and as you said, since the beginning of the pandemic, we've gotten to at least floor-like guidance here, and that's what $4.90 is. it's a floor right now. could that be better? yes, it could. there could be elements that could make that number be better.
but on top of absorbing all these incremental headwinds here, inflation, currency, making some of the investments we need on nutrition, we're still able to raise our full-year guidance.
joshua jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
and just one follow-up on the medical devices business, and it's encouraging to hear you talk about kind of quick improvement in the back half, and you did have that tough comp in 2q. but are you able to share any high-level color just on elective procedure trends throughout the quarter in 2q, just a month-over-month improvement did you see? and then anything you can share on color in july? and just wondering, you caught a couple of the headwinds that you saw in 2q for hospitals and the challenges that they're facing to accelerate elective procedure volumes in the second half. but what do you think the biggest challenge is? and do you think the hospitals are well equipped to overcome those?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, sure. i think you mentioned there, i mean, q2 last year was a pretty significant revenue for a lot in medtech, so there is that comp aspect there. but second-quarter procedures and volumes, if i look at abbott's procedure volumes and sales, they're actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. and there was sequential growth from q2 to q1, over 7% in the u.s.
and a little bit lower internationally. so the aspect here is that we are seeing growth and -- but it was a little bit more modest than what we had anticipated back in april, right? and then i think there's really three factors there. one of them, as i said, in the u.s., specifically, i think the staffing challenges were a factor there. and as people tested positive, while they didn't have to go to the hospital and they could just stay at home, that had an impact in some of the procedures that there's a little bit more planning toward.
so the good news is we know what those procedures are, we know where they are, and we've got an opportunity to follow up on them like we did last year and following up on all the procedures that got pushed out. so internationally, i think you saw some similar headwinds there, but i think the biggest headwind for us was china and the lockdowns that occurred there. and then the third factor for us was we had some back order and that was really due to the timing of input material availability. so in terms of when you receive the materials to build the product, now we are building inventory, and i don't anticipate that to be the case going forward in the second half.
so those are really our fact -- those are really the facts that had our device business a little bit more modest than what we predicted in april. i think those get better. one, we've got launch activity. so -- and i'm sure we'll talk about some of those also, products that we've launched that will gain in momentum in the second half.
in talking to a lot of the u.s. systems, they've just got to figure out better how to staff and to do more planning, and that might involve maybe looking at having more procedures booked because you know that there's a certain amount of cancellations that will happen. so i think that will get better also as the hospitals understand these dynamics. so i'm excited about the device portfolio in terms of the second half, not only because of some of these issues, which i think will get better, but also because of our pipeline and the products we're launching and the execution.
joshua jennings -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks again.
operator
and our next question will come from larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is now open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
robert, can you hear me ok?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i can, larry.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
you'd cut out a little bit. so two for me, i wanted to start with libre. robert, just a multipart question here on libre. another nice quarter.
any -- how should we think about the libre 3 launch in the u.s.? should we expect it to be kind of a gradual rollout like we saw with libre 2? and how are you feeling about resolving the vitamin c interaction issue? it sounds like you guys have made some good progress there. and just lastly, international was a little softer than we expected. is this just kind of a law of large numbers? or is this just a timing issue in terms of the full rollout of libre 3? and i did have one follow-up.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i think libre 3, we're very excited. we've had very good success in germany in terms of upgrading the base and then with the benefits of libre 3 actually seeing some conversions from competitive systems. so the u.s.
launch is going to be exciting for the u.s. team. it will be the only cgm with a sub-8% mard. and that launch process is underway, but it is a little bit more gradual.
so we're going to work to get on to pharmacy contracts, pbm contracts, managed care contracts, etc. so we're building inventory. we're familiarizing the physicians with the product. but given what i've seen in europe, i think this is a great opportunity for our u.s.
business, which, by the way, did really well this quarter, right, even without libre 3. we grew 53% in the second quarter, and i actually think that we can maintain that 30% to 40% growth rate in the u.s. even without libre 3. so i think that's going to be an important growth driver for us toward the end of the year and as we go into 2023.
i do think, larry, that cgm is a little different. i mean, we have it in devices, but the model, at least in the u.s., is very pharma-like and -- where patient out-of-pocket, coinsurance, co-pays, contracts, etc., they play a big role in understanding those, and the interdependencies of those are very important. i think in an environment where employers and consumers are going to be looking more closely at managing their expenses, i think the value proposition of libre is going to be even stronger. regarding your question on vitamin c, fixed, yes.
we have done the work to be able to address that. we've made very good progress. i'm going to provide further updates over time. but obviously, this relates only to the u.s.
we're actually going to be launching an aid system in europe with our partners in europe in q4 with libre 2. so -- but you'll get more updates on that. i think that the exciting piece on the pump connectivity, though, is what we announced in june at the ada with a dual sensor, a glucose-ketone sensor that's under development, that's received breakthrough designation from the fda. the scientific advisors that i've spoken to, both in the u.s.
and international, believe that this is going to become the go-to sensor for pump connectivity and -- just because of the ability to bring in the ketone measurement and perfect even more of those algorithms. so i think this is going to be an ideal sensor for existing pump companies and even for new pump manufacturers. regarding your question on international, there's a little bit of timing there, i would say. well, it's two parts, a little bit of timing from -- in germany as we convert to libre 3 and the mechanism is in place there.
and then there was some fx headwind that impacted a lot of our international businesses. so did that cover all for you, larry?
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that was very comprehensive. really appreciate it. just for my follow-up, robert, i know i've asked this a lot on recent calls, but you're sitting on a lot of cash. and we have seen a recent rerating of valuations.
so are you starting to see more opportunities? any color on deal size that you're looking at? and i think some investors are saying, when covid testing comes down, you might have a gap in terms of earnings that you need to fill. so how important is it to find an accretive deal to offset potential decline in covid testing?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, on the covid testing side, i mean, i guess, we'll have to kind of see how things play out right now. i mean, i guess, that was the same comment last year. and as i said, we're selling more. we're probably selling more what we sold more in the first six months here versus last year.
so regarding your comment, though, on the m&a side, yes, i don't think anything has really changed there. i mean, obviously, valuations have obviously come down somewhat. and we've got the capacity, as you said, in our balance sheet and that flexibility. but the macro environment is -- just because the valuation has come down, i mean, it's challenging and dynamic for all the companies, even the ones that have seen these valuations come significantly down.
so i think we -- while we do have cash, i still think we need to be strategically and financially disciplined here to be mindful of when we're assessing these potential targets and have they gotten to the right point given some of these macro environments that are going to be playing out. so i think the market needs to stabilize for a period of time here, larry, before i think a lot of management teams and their board to become a little more comfortable with the reset of their valuations and their financial outlook. that being said, yes, i'd say the level of study, the level of review, the level of analysis on potential targets has definitely increased over the past four, five months here. and i've been clear about the areas that we're looking at and the kind of types of transactions we would be interested of, but it always goes back to does it make sense strategically and does it make sense financially.
so nothing has changed yet.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks for that. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
and our next question will come from joanne wuensch from citi. your line is now open.
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. i'm going to put them all upfront. some questions regarding your structural heart franchise. could you give us sort of a state of the union or update on where you are on some key products, mitraclip, portico, and amulet? and then just as a follow-up to the previous question, could you remind us where you are on share repurchases and your view toward if you're not using the cash for m&a, what you will be using the cash for?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. on the structural heart side, i talked about how this is such an important division for us and the focus that we've had there. so i'd say on amulet, we've had a very good quarter in amulet aligned to the trends that we were hoping for. we've got an expansion of the amount of accounts that are using the product and also an expansion on the amount of implanters that are completing and performing this procedure.
one of the challenges we had in the beginning was just really to get the implanters trained. we needed proctors. and as you remember, in november, december, january, and february, there was a lot of challenge with travel. so that's actually looking really nice in terms of the ramp there.
what i'm very encouraged about is the traction we're seeing from the early adopters. so some of those that began the training and implanting in q4 of last year, their utilization is more than double that of the average user. so we're seeing both things in terms of driving the sales there, the increase of new accounts and then the increase in productivity and utilization of the existing implanters. on the portico side or on the tavr side, sales have been strong, especially in europe where we've introduced navitor, which is our next-generation tavr system.
it's a competitive device from a clinical profile in high-risk patients. i estimate right now -- we estimate right now that we're about a high single digit. but when we look at the centers that are using navitor, and navitor is probably in about 40%, 45% of the centers in europe, shares in the mid-teens. and that's very encouraging also because navitor being our second product has really been an improvement for portico.
and as you know, we filed that in the u.s. in october of last year at the pma. i expect that to be the case. i expect to see an approval and an opportunity for us to launch into the tavr market here in the u.s.
and on mitraclip, this was a tough comp for us this quarter. last quarter -- last year, it was the highest quarter we've ever had in terms of procedures, in terms of sales. so there's no doubt that this one here is probably a little bit more impacted by covid and some of the healthcare staffing challenges and the rescheduling of the procedures. so i expect these dynamics to steadily improve over time.
and as i said previously, i don't think we fully benefited yet from the indication expansion that we received for the functional mr. so the market still remains pretty underpenetrated, and there's a lot of opportunity for growth there. so a lot of activity in our structural heart business, a lot of good performance. and i just expect that to get better over the next couple of quarters.
and then what was your other question?
joanne wuensch -- citi -- analyst
it had to do on share repurchases, use of cash if you're not using it for m&a.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, listen, we've always kind of had a balanced approach for deploying our cash. we're mindful of our cash on hand. we're investing in the dividend, and we've been growing that dividend, and that's an important part of it.
we're investing in the capacity expansions in several of our areas, libre, electrophysiology, mitraclip, nutrition. and we bought back shares in the first half of the year and something that we'll continue to assess as we go through the second half year. so the approach toward our capital allocation is pretty balanced, and we're committed to the dividend. done some share buybacks in the first half.
we'll continue to assess in the second half. and there's great opportunities for us to continue to invest organically to be able to drive the organic part of the business.
operator
our next question will come from vijay kumar from evercore isi. your line is open.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, bob. thanks for taking my question. congrats on a strong 2q here. one on this guidance here, when you look at the base floor for fiscal '22, $4.90, you guys did close to $3.15 of earnings in first half, so the implied earnings for back half was -- the floor is $1.74.
that's annualizing to about $3.50-ish. is there -- i guess, that $1.74-ish for back half, that's below the back half of 2019. so i'm wondering, between fx, inflation, is there something else that's going on here where -- we still have covid revenues flowing through in the back half? it seems a little light on the eps guidance.
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
vijay, this is bob, i'll take that call -- question. i think it's -- i think using an implied kind of fourth quarter exit rate as an indicator kind of how we're thinking about '23 probably wouldn't be prudent at this point. there's obviously a lot going on in the macro environment that warrants further monitoring and assessment. and on top of that, there are a couple of swing factors that are specific to us.
strength of our covid testing business, that's provided us an awful lot of flexibility to reinvest back into our p&l over the last couple of years. and so as part of our -- and as robert kind of talked about, we'll see kind of how covid testing plays out. we continue to see very strong demand. and so there's some element of that that we fully expect to stick around.
and it's just difficult to pinpoint what that level is at this point in the year. but as part of our budgeting process for next year, we'll take a close look at the overall cost structure, which robert touched on, and our investment priorities. and as you know, we're also working through the nutrition recall and making good progress, incrementally investing, and robert talked about the fact that some of those investments will modulate over time or even go away. and so that, combined with recapturing share, we'll see the earnings power of that business ramp up over time.
so -- and then finally, our pipeline has been highly productive and especially in devices. and as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. so those are big moving parts. and as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements and especially in devices.
and as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. so those are big moving parts. and as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements in our forecast next year.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
i guess, i'll just add to that, vijay, also, i mean, we talk about the strength of the u.s. dollar and the impact that we're having on a full year basis. it's pretty significant, and a big portion of that impact is actually forecasted to happen in the second half of this year. so that also plays a role together with the inflation aspects that we're facing.
so that's really the challenge.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. and maybe one last one. with the second half base business guidance mid-single digit to high single digits, if i look at 2q ex china and ex nutrition, the base business did north of 7%, which is in line with the high single sort of trajectory that investors have baked in. the back half of mid-single to high single --
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
so like i said, i think we've got an opportunity here on the back half also. we've set a floor. and again, i'll just reiterate that this is where contemplating all these puts and takes that we've been discussing, we feel confident in that floor number. and we believe that there's opportunities here for upside to that.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
vijay, i would just say, as bob said in his prepared remarks, excluding nutrition, we expect high single digits for the kind of remainder of the businesses to your point. so the math you're doing there is right.
vijay kumar -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful, scott. so the guide is assuming some impact here in the back half. that's helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
and our next question will come from travis steed from bank of america. your line is now open.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. can you hear me ok?
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. just wanted to ask a couple more on the margin puts and takes, and i know these are related to robbie's question. you mentioned a lot of like onetime costs in nutrition with contracts on top of inflation and fx. so just wanted to think about the commitment and ability to grow operating margin off this year's base margins.
if the macro environment just remains stable, i assume most of those nutrition and onetime investments go away later this year as nutrition ramps back up. but i don't know if there's any other levers that you can pull on the margin line. and also not sure about this year's fx headwinds, how much of those naturally carry over into next year? that's something that j&j kind of flagged for people.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. listen, the commitment to grow the operating margin is always there. we've -- we always shoot for that growth. you had a big if there, and that's the big if, right, if the conditions remain the same.
so i don't know what currency is going to look like next year. bob can talk about that a little bit. but there are some of these costs that i mentioned that i don't anticipate having to fly in the amount formula that we flew in from overseas. i don't anticipate having to kind of pay those wic rebates on competitive product.
we have, what i would call, a steady investment profile on our nutrition business that, i would say, we're a little bit out of profile in the next quarter or so because we want to make sure that as products coming back that we can work to regain our share. and we've seen some of that share regain the last couple of months. i mean, from the start of the recall, we lost about half of our imf share. and of that half that we lost in the last couple of months, we've regained half of that back.
so some of these costs, like i said, are more onetime in nature. on the fx side, i don't know, bob, do you have a comment on there?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
well, i guess, i'd say history has taught us that rates rarely if ever hold for a long period of time. so trying to pinpoint kind of an accurate projection for next year at this point is pretty challenging. there's an awful lot of moving parts. as you know, different central banks taking different rate actions, different strengths of economies, etc.
that said, at a high level, based upon kind of where we're at today, a decent portion of the impact we're seeing this year will carry into next year. obviously, there's a long way to go, so we need to see how things play out. and as part of our planning process, we always look for opportunities to mitigate currency impacts as best we can.
travis steed -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's helpful. i do want to make sure i heard you right. it sounds like you're going to launch an aid insulin system in europe with libre 2 by q4. and i don't know if you'd be willing to say who that partner is or what that product might look like in any form or fashion.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think we made an announcement about the partnership several -- about a month, month and a half ago. so yes, that's with ypsomed, a local european manufacturer, and another partner. so yes, our target is to be able to launch that by the end of the year in europe.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
ok. no. great. thanks a lot for the questions.
operator, we'll take one more question.
operator
and our last question will come from jayson bedford from raymond james. your line is now open.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. just a couple. first, on the infant nutrition and the manufacturing ramp here, is there any way to frame where you are today and when you feel like you'll be back to full production levels? and obviously, i'm just thinking in the context of where you were last year and potential profit recapture in this segment.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, as i said, we restarted in july 1, and we began production of the specialty formulas. the production of the similac, which we call our more base formula, i mean, we're very close to that, jayson, is what i would say. i don't want to necessarily kind of put an exact date here, but we're not talking months, we're not talking weeks.
so we're very close there, and we obviously have a team that's ready to go and to ramp up. we know that we're going to have to work hard to shorten the time between manufacturer and on-shelf availability. so there's a team that's specifically dedicated to working on accelerated that time frame also. so i like where we're at.
and we'll continue to use our global network to be able to augment those efforts of share recapture.
jayson bedford -- raymond james -- analyst
so, robert, when we look at '23 for usp, is it -- the debate just around market share, and i'm assuming from a manufacturing standpoint, you should be clean in '23.
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. that's our expectation. i think the debate on '23 is predominantly market share and then there might be a little bit of market also in terms of understanding how much of the growth in today's market is inventory build. we have seen an increase in birth rates, so that's another opportunity also for -- to maybe to offset that.
so -- but yes, i think it's mostly about market share, market share recovery. and like i said, i think in the previous question, i think we've done pretty well about using our network to be able to regain the market share that we had lost in those first couple of months. so yes, it's really about looking at our share and share recovery, which is why, as i said, we've made some investments during -- over the next three, four, five months here to be able to put us in, in that right position in 2023. so i'll just close the call here.
obviously, a lot of your questions, so that there is, i guess, some uncertainty in the environment. it's pretty dynamic, and i think that's going to be the same for a lot of companies. for abbott specifically, our new product launches are performing very well. our r&d pipeline is strong.
and as i said, our financial health is also strong. we're making progress in nutrition to drive share recovery, and our adult business and international growth opportunities still remain very strong. the cardiovascular portfolio, device portfolio, there is growth. it continues to recover, albeit not at the same level that we had forecasted back in april, but i do expect that same recovery trend.
it's not as leaner as we would like or as what we've historically had. but ultimately, i do believe that the segment will continue to grow and recover. epd and libre continue to perform very well. and in diagnostics, i get that covid testing is a big portion of the equation here.
but i just remind ourselves to where we were last year and what we thought was going to happen last year. and right now, all the data shows that testing is still here. cases are up. our test sales are actually up, and our tests have done very well from a brand and become somewhat of a preferred format over here.
so as i look to the second half of the year, i anticipate some of the macro challenges to continue, in some cases, to be tough. and in other cases, hopefully, we'll see some easing on there. but our diversification is very unique, and that's what's held up very well. we're navigating the macro headwinds.
we're investing in our growth platforms. and we've raised our guidance for the full year. and i think that's a rarity in this environment, and i think it speaks to the strength of the portfolio and the execution and our ability to manage and leverage the portfolio. so with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us today.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to abbott second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] this call is being recorded by abbott. with the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by abbott.
it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without abbott's expressed written permission. i would now like to introduce mr. scott leinenweber, vice president, investor relations, licensing, and acquisitions.
scott leinenweber -- vice president of investor relations, licensing, and acquisition
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today are robert ford, chairman and chief executive officer; and bob funck, executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. robert and bob will provide opening remarks. following their comments, we'll take your questions.
before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a, risk factors, to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021. abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.
on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbott's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. note that abbott has not provided the gaap financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
with that, i will now turn the call over to robert. 
robert ford -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, we reported results of another strong quarter. earnings per share were $1.43, reflecting more than 20% growth compared to last year.
sales increased nearly 14.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by growth in established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and medical devices. based on our performance for the first six months, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $4.90 for the full year. this speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified healthcare model as well as strong execution in this challenging macro environment. we continue to advance our r&d pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several new product approvals.
our supply chain has remained resilient, and our financial health remains strong. i'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to bob, and i'll start with established pharmaceuticals, or epd, where sales increased more than 9% in the quarter. strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including china, brazil, colombia, mexico, and vietnam. epd continues to execute and perform at a very high level in a dynamic environment, achieving double-digit organic sales growth over the past year and a half, including more than 11% organic growth for the first half of this year.
moving to diagnostics, where sales grew over 35% in the quarter. covid test sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, more than 95% of which came from rapid tests, including binaxnow in the u.s., panbio internationally, and id now globally. as we had predicted some time ago, rapid testing has become widely accepted and has proven to be a very important tool in combating the virus due to its affordability and accessibility, including at-home testing. and while vaccines have been shown to play an important role in reducing severity of outcomes, with the emergence of new variants that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool we have to help people quickly and easily identify new cases and quarantine to help slow and prevent transmission.
as you know, forecasting covid testing demand beyond the near term has been challenging. as such, our forecast for the next few months contemplates a modest approaching endemic-like amount of testing sales. we are in regular discussions with governments around the world, including the u.s., for surveillance testing needs and to ensure capacity is available and ready, if we see another surge this winter. if that were to happen, we have a lot of manufacturing capacity in the u.s.
and internationally to help meet testing needs. i'll now turn to nutrition, where, as you know, we initiated a voluntary recall in february of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our u.s. facilities. earlier this month, we resumed partial production at that facility, starting with our specialty formula elecare and metabolic formulas.
we are in the final phases of testing to restart similac production. as a reminder, once we begin production, it takes several weeks for product to reach store shelves. that said, we will do everything possible to accelerate delivery of product to retailers, so families can have access to the formula they need as soon as possible. we've already started to see some share recovery at retail over the past couple of months, as we leveraged our global manufacturing network to increase supply to the u.s., including importing product from our fda registered plant in ireland.
we also began importing product from spain after receiving informed discretion from the fda that expanded the allowance for imports. as i said in april, it's important to note that the results of the investigation from the fda, cdc, and abbott concluded no evidence linked our formulas to any infant illnesses or deaths, and there is no new information to suggest otherwise. we take this matter very seriously, and we're making a number of enhancements to our operations at the impacted manufacturing plant. we're also taking steps across our manufacturing network to expand capacity and redundancy.
we're committed to set the standard in industry on quality and safety and to reearn the trust of the families that depend on us. across our broader nutrition business, global sales in adult nutrition increased 5% in the quarter, including more than 7.5% growth internationally led by our market-leading ensure and glucerna brands. and lastly, i'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. in cardiovascular devices, sales growth was led by structural heart and heart failure.
while cardiovascular procedure trends continued to improve, growth in the quarter was somewhat more modest than what we had anticipated back in april due to several factors, most notably healthcare staffing challenges, covid surges, and lockdowns in china that were implemented as part of their efforts to control the spread of the virus. we expect these dynamics to improve in the second half of the year. in diabetes care, sales of freestyle libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, and our user base now exceeds 4 million users globally. during the quarter, we continued to strengthen our medical device portfolio with innovative new products, most notably u.s.
fda clearance of our freestyle libre 3 continuous glucose monitoring system, which is the world's smallest and thinnest wearable glucose sensor that provides results with the highest level of accuracy in the industry. and u.s. approval of aveir, our leadless pacemaker for the management of slow heart rhythms, aveir was specifically designed to be retrievable if the device ever needs to be removed and expandable to a dual-chamber device, which is currently under development if the therapy needs to evolve over time. so in summary, our diversified healthcare model continues to prove highly resilient in a dynamic macro environment.
we're achieving strong growth across several areas of the portfolio and making good progress restarting our nutrition manufacturing facility. and as a result of our strong performance through the first six months, we're raising our eps guidance for the year. i'll now turn over the call to bob. bob?
bob funck -- executive vice president, finance, and chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. turning to our results. sales for the second quarter increased 14.3% on an organic basis, which was led by strong growth in diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, along with global covid testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter.
during the second quarter, sales were negatively impacted by a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown in february of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our u.s. plants. excluding covid testing-related sales and the u.s. sales associated with the recalled products, abbott sales increased 6.2% on an organic basis in the second quarter.
foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 4.2% on second-quarter sales. during the quarter, we saw the u.s. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in april. regarding other aspects of the p&l, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.7% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the recent nutrition recall and incremental inflation we saw in certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter.
adjusted r&d investment was 5.8% of sales, and adjusted sg&a investment was 24.4% of sales in the second quarter. lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%. turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. we forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of covid testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits.
it is important to note, excluding products impacted by the nutrition recall, we forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, excluding covid testing-related sales and areas of nutrition not impacted by the recall. we forecast covid testing-related sales of $6.1 billion, which includes year-to-date sales through june of $5.6 billion and projected sales of approximately $500 million over the next few months. we will continue to update our covid testing-related sales forecast one quarter at a time as appropriate. lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 5% on our full-year reported sales.
with that, we'll now open the call for questions.
