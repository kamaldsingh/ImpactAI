brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. wiley continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter based on the consistent execution of our customer-centric strategies in research and education. more than a year into the pandemic, it is clear that wiley is very well-positioned to help our core customers, researchers and learners to achieve their goals in a very different and sometimes very challenging world.
learners were settled into online and hybrid education like never before, and wiley has what they need to succeed on their personal career journeys. researchers are conducting their work in increasingly virtual and open ways, and wiley has what they need to get their discoveries out to the world as quickly as possible where they can drive understanding and innovation. without doubt, the covid pandemic has demonstrated yet again the enduring strength of the research and education markets. the demand for high-quality, peer-reviewed research continues to grow, and the need has never been more urgent for affordable education that connects people directly to good jobs.
wiley is committed to making the overall knowledge ecosystem more productive [inaudible] in all that we do, our goal is to increase the speed, volume and impact of research and education. by succeeding at this, we will achieve our company's mission, which is to unlock human potential. today, wiley is a digital company that draws 83% of its revenue from digital products and services, which grew at 7% in total over the past 12 months. overall, 55% of wiley's revenue today is recurring.
our digital research content and platforms generate billions of user sessions each year. and our digital courseware and online degree programs support greater affordability and impact in education, and thus, rapidly increasing unit volumes. beyond revenue growth, our digital revenue streams deliver strong profitability based on attractive, sustainable business models. in the past year, we've seen an acceleration of three long-standing trends that define our markets: the move toward open research in a more productive research ecosystem, the migration to online and hybrid education in university and corporate settings; and the increased adoption of digital tools and courseware needed to power online and hybrid education.
our strategies are organized around these trends, and they're paying off. we are capitalizing on the move to open research today. under the pay-to-publish oa model, revenue is a direct function of price and quantity of articles published. we are achieving significant volume growth based upon the draw of our strong brands and the execution of our publishing strategies, supported by the market's strong underlying article growth.
combined with strong pricing power, this volume growth is allowing us to achieve double-digit oa revenue growth. the recent acquisition of hindawi further strengthens our growth potential. i'll talk about this a bit later. the second positive trend, the growth of online degrees in hybrid education, has accelerated significantly in the past year, helped along by the pandemic.
wiley has long been a gold standard strategic partner for universities, helping them to design and deliver effective degree programs and demand for these services continues to rise, as schools plan their increasingly digital futures. this has translated into double-digit growth in online enrollment and new student starts, both key indicators for future growth. the third trend toward digital curriculum reflects the maturation of online content and courseware as the preferred media for effective learning. this trend, which has been ongoing for years, has benefited from the strong acceleration of online education.
happily, the growth of digital content and courseware is outpacing the decline of print over the past fiscal year. it seems that the world has figured out that our digital courseware is simply a more effective product that can be delivered at a lower price than legacy print products. from wiley's point of view, products like our zybooks win more adoptions and then gain significantly higher sell-through in each adoption by obsoleting substitutes, such as oer, used books and rentals. as you can see, our strategies are directly aligned with these core market trends, and we're confident in the direction that we're headed.
the wiley team delivered another strong quarter of execution and performance. revenue was up 2%, adjusted ebitda was up 7% and adjusted eps was up 6%. our q3 revenue performance was driven by research with hindawi contributing $2 million in inorganic revenue and strong organic growth in education services. solid adjusted eps growth in the quarter was the result of top-line revenue performance, lower costs from business optimization and covid-related savings, offsetting $0.12 of dilution related to the hindawi acquisition.
our gaap eps performance was impacted by a $21 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the reduction of our real estate footprint as we shift to more of a hybrid working model across wiley. for the first nine months of fiscal '21, revenue was up 3% over prior year to $1.4 billion, adjusted ebitda was up 16% to $309 million and adjusted eps was up 20% to $2.09. free cash flow year to date was $80 million or $74 million higher than prior year due to strong earnings performance and lower capex. our ebitda margin for the nine-month period was 22%, compared to 19% in the prior year.
so overall, we are pleased with where we are after three quarters. now let's take a look at our three segments. the key highlights for research publishing and platforms include our strong ongoing publishing output, the strategic momentum in our platforms and our corporate offerings and the acquisition of hindawi. revenue was up 1% in the quarter and 4% year to date.
research adjusted ebitda was even with prior year as we targeted additional investment and improving our publishing infrastructure and workflows. our research adjusted ebitda margin was, for the quarter, 34%. fully in line with our expectations, we've seen modest covid-related pressure on our calendar-year '21 journal subscription renewals. this pressure was offset by continued double-digit growth in open access publishing and corporate solutions.
research platforms continue to perform well with revenue up 4%. research article output continues to grow nicely, up 17% year to date. and research consumption, meaning usage of the wiley online library, was up over 20%. for context, our world-class literatum content platform has hosted over 4 billion user sessions in the past 12 months and maintains a 99% client retention rate.
notably, our strategic read and publish agreements are succeeding, generating publishing volumes from these deals that are exceeding expectations. in the quarter, we signed a multiyear read and publish agreement with italy, and we see a good pipeline ahead. we continue to see opportunities in asia. we recently entered a 10-year strategic partnership with the chinese medical association publishing house, one of china's leading health science publishers.
we will be providing the online home for the entire cma publishing portfolio, and we will also launch 10 co-published open access journals. this important deal leverages our global leadership in publishing and platforms and further extends wiley's unmatched global network of societies, universities and corporate partners. wiley's expanding research platforms offering includes the hosting and management of career centers for our partners that help researchers and other job seekers connect with great jobs. in the quarter, we added the american college of veterinary internal medicine and the american anthropological association, among others, to our growing list of career center clients.
as you can tell, career advancement is a consistent theme across wiley in both education and research, and here, we are helping the research community to connect directly with their next jobs. in the final months of the year, we are focused on closing our calendar-year '21 subscription renewals while continuing to advance our volume-based publishing strategies, and as always, improving our efficiency. for the nine months, research adjusted ebitda is up 11% for an ebitda margin of 36%, although we anticipate a ramp-up of investment in q4 related to enabling publishing growth and the integration of hindawi. now i want to give you some insight into this recent acquisition.
hindawi is one of the world's fastest-growing scientific research publishers and a true innovator in open access publishing. in fact, hindawi is the first subscription publisher to convert its entire portfolio of journals to oa nearly 15 years ago. this addition augments our strategy in three very important ways. first, hindawi brings a fast-growing portfolio of over 200 open access journals that complements wiley's journal portfolio extremely well.
by expanding our portfolio and strategic discipline, we can seamlessly provide a high-quality publishing home for more of the articles that are submitted to wiley, growing our output and increasing author satisfaction. second, as an early leader in open access, hindawi has built an innovative publishing platform and a publishing process that is highly efficient and very user-friendly. this has helped them to grow fast and profitably. when combined with wiley's strong platforms and services, the hindawi platform and their approach will enhance the efficiency, the productivity and the customer satisfaction of the publishing process across wiley.
today, hindawi provides its platform services to other publishers who are adapting to the oa transition. this can represent a real struggle for survival for many publishers and society. so the third way that hindawi augments our strategy is by enhancing wiley's research platforms business by increasing the breadth of the offerings that we can provide to our market-leading network of society and publishing partners. we're very excited about joining forces with the excellent team at hindawi and leveraging all that they bring for wiley.
third-quarter highlights for academic and professional learning include continued strong digital growth in education publishing and an improving outlook for professional learning as it rebounds from covid, along with the overall margin gain from optimization. revenue was down 4% for the quarter due to declines in printed course material, continued exam cancellations in test prep and delayed purchasing pattern for digital products when compared to print. the print decline offset 11% growth in digital content, including 45% growth in zybooks courseware. digital courseware activations were up over 20% in the quarter and year to date.
activations are a key performance metric for us, and i'm pleased to report that our core wileyplus platform recorded 1 million activations recently for the first time in its history, and zybooks has now surpassed 325,000 users at over 900 universities. professional learning saw a significant improvement this quarter results for trade publishing with growth in title output and e-book sales. our dummies franchise continued to be a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth, driven by timely publishing of new titles and hot topics, such as stock investing and remote learning. we also saw positive development in corporate learning with significant upsell growth at existing clients and a strong shift to virtual delivery and corporate training.
this is a very positive development for this increasingly digital business. adjusted ebitda for the quarter rose 2% for an ebitda margin of 29%. year-to-date revenue and adjusted ebitda were down 7% and 8%, mainly due to covid-related challenges. in the fourth quarter, we will continue to execute on our strategy to grow digital content in courseware with, as always, a particular focus on high-demand career discipline.
education services had a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in online enrollment, strong organic revenue growth and margin and the addition of new degree programs and university partnerships. revenue rose 24% or 13% organically, driven by 15% growth in student enrollment. new student enrollment in our existing programs grew 29%, an important leading indicator of future revenue growth. we signed full-service partnerships with tel aviv university in israel, lebanon american university in lebanon and in the u.s., new mexico highlands university in spring hill college.
we also added a partnership with new york university for unbundled services. wiley will support undergraduate, graduate and doctoral online programs at these schools in a variety of high-demand disciplines like healthcare and computer science. our focus on driving strong profitable growth continues to bear fruit with an adjusted ebitda margin of 19%. this achievement, coupled with accelerating revenue momentum, reflects our focus on building a strong growth business for the long term.
we are doing it through our broad partner reach and our relentless focus on excellent outcomes through the student journey, free application all the way through graduation and in fact, career success. wiley's mthree, our last-mile training service, is gaining momentum as corporate demand for tech talent returns to strength. as a reminder, mthree, one of the -- mthree addresses one of the global economy's greatest needs by finding, training and placing job-ready tech talent with leading corporation. placement growth is accelerating as companies continue to wrestle with the dearth of it and digital skills in the workforce.
we signed three new corporate clients this quarter, including two very important fortune 500 companies, and we see a growing pipeline ahead, as companies plan for the post-covid economy. in the fourth quarter in education services, we anticipate strong online enrollment growth to continue and the demand for online programs to remain high. so across wiley, our global team delivered another strong quarter of execution, efficiency and momentum. i'll now pass the call over to john.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. as brian noted, our team continues to effectively execute on our growth strategies and business optimization initiatives, delivering favorable results and building momentum. our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity enable us to confidently invest, acquire and return cash to shareholders. our improved year-to-date earnings reflect a 15% increase in adjusted ebitda, including a 240-basis-point improvement in our adjusted ebitda margin to nearly 22%.
adjusted eps growth of 22% contributed to cash flow performance well ahead of prior year with cash from operations and free cash flow favorable to prior year by $66 million and $75 million, respectively. capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, were $75 million for the nine-month period, running $8 million lower than prior year. we continue to expect full-year capital expenditures to be around $100 million with investment focused on developing and enhancing tech-enabled products and services in our core growth areas and optimizing workflows, particularly in research. we acquired hindawi this quarter for $298 million, funded by cash on hand and borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility.
as noted at the time of acquisition, hindawi's attractive financial profile includes strong revenue growth and ebitda margin in excess of 40%. in combining hindawi with wiley's research business, we are well-positioned to realize significant revenue and cost synergies, and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our adjusted eps in fiscal-year '23. our net debt-to-ebitda ratio inclusive of borrowings for hindawi was 2.2 at quarter end. with respect to acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic as we look to add scale and tech-enabled capabilities in research and online education.
our quarter-end debt balance was $163 million higher than the same time last year due to acquisitions, while our interest expense was down nearly $2 million given the benefit of the lower interest rate environment. in terms of liquidity, we reported $91 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn credit capacity of $529 million. our current dividend yield is roughly 2.7%. we resumed share repurchases in early january following our announcement of the hindawi acquisition.
within our brief open trading window in january, we spent $7 million on 147,000 shares at an average cost per share of $48.09. note, 660,000 shares remain in our 2016 share repurchase authorization and $200 million of authorized purchases remain in our 2020 program. we continue to design and implement material improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. in research, we continue to invest in optimizing our end-to-end publishing operation, driving improvements in publishing cycle time and cost per article.
as brian noted, we will gain scale advantage from the addition of the hindawi portfolio to our article cascade strategy. in addition, hindawi operates a low-cost publishing platform and efficient infrastructure, which we will leverage more broadly for open access publishing. in academic and professional learning, we're investing in our e-commerce capabilities for both education and trade publishing, and we are revitalizing our popular dummies.com website with an improved digital content platform. in education services, we're further improving our recruitment operations from lead generation through to student application and enrollment, driving ebitda margin performance in line with our profitable growth strategy.
as part of our overall business optimization program, we recorded a restructuring charge this quarter of $21 million related to our previously reported 12% real estate footprint reduction. we are permanently shifting to a virtual work environment for many of our smaller offices and implementing a hybrid working model at our larger facilities. as a result of these real estate actions, we anticipate annual run rate savings of approximately $8 million beginning in fiscal '22. and finally, as noted last quarter, we continued to generate significant covid-related savings on travel, events and facilities expenses.
we are taking actions to sustain much of these savings in our post-pandemic operations. turning to our full-year outlook. given our solid year-to-date performance and foreign exchange impacts, we are raising our guidance for revenue, ebitda, eps and cash flow. the raised outlook is inclusive of hindawi's impact.
for revenue, we now project a range of $1.9 billion to $1.92 billion, up from the previous range of $1.865 billion to $1.885 billion and up from $1.83 billion in fiscal '20. at the segment level, we continue to project low single-digit revenue growth in research and double-digit revenue growth in education services, although we're raising the organic growth projection for education services to mid- to high single digits. we continue to project a mid-single-digit decline in academic and professional learning. note, our revenue outlook includes approximately $10 million of additional revenue from hindawi.
revenue growth, business optimization gains and expense savings continue to fuel our strong profit growth. we now anticipate adjusted ebitda of $395 million to $410 million, up from the prior range of $380 million to $395 million and up from $356 million in fiscal '20. hindawi is roughly neutral to ebitda for the year. we are modestly raising our adjusted eps guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.75, up from the prior range of $2.50 to $2.70 and up from $2.40 in fiscal '20.
our adjusted eps outlook includes approximately $0.15 of dilution from hindawi, primarily related to transaction costs and purchase accounting impacts. and finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance from $175 million to $200 million -- i'm sorry, to $225 million, up from $173 million in the prior fiscal year. the anticipated year-over-year cash flow improvement reflects higher earnings and relatively flat cash tax payments, including the $21 million cash cares act tax refund, which we recorded last quarter. that cash refund was received in early february.
hindawi's operating impact is projected to be cash flow neutral for this fiscal year, but we anticipate it to be modestly cash flow accretive in fiscal '22. while delivering these results, we will continue to invest in market-driven growth opportunities in open research, online education and digital curriculum and in our optimization programs to generate sustained efficiencies. we will continue to fund these investments through those optimization savings and strong cash generation. i'll now pass the call back to brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. so let me recap the key takeaways from the third quarter. our business has remained strong through the year, thus far. in a challenging year for all, we have continued to execute our strategy, which builds on the core trends in our important markets, namely open research, online education and digital curriculum.
as a result, we're growing research output significantly and growing our digital platforms business. we're growing the adoption and consumption of high-impact affordable digital content and courseware. we're growing enrollment in our high-quality career-focused degree programs. we are expanding our unmatched network of leading universities, societies and corporate partners.
this unique asset supports wiley's success across research and education. we continue to selectively advance our core strategy through m&a, adding hindawi this quarter to accelerate our open research growth strategy, and we are consistently working to improve our efficiency and our profitability. the upshot is that the wiley team has delivered solid results for the quarter and year to date, and this is allowing us to raise our full-year outlook. as always, wiley's performance is a team effort.
year-in and year-out, our wonderful colleagues around the world demonstrate their dedication to each other, to our customers and to our important mission, which remains to unlock human potential through the advancement of research and education. i thank the team for its extraordinary efforts and its many accomplishments, and i will now open the floor to any comments and questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from daniel moore from cjs securities. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
brian, john, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to -- a lot of color on hindawi, but i did want to pick up there as well. can you, brian, maybe just give a little bit more color into the potential revenue synergies that you've described or alluded to over time, just how the two fit together and how you see that one plus one equaling a little bit more than two?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. so as a baseline, hindawi is, obviously, an extremely successful company in and of itself. it was growing very rapidly and was nicely profitable, as you know. but by becoming part of the wiley portfolio, it really is a one plus one equals three.
it's really critical as we move forward that we maintain scale and grow scale, but that we grow scale in the right ways. so the number one way that these two companies, wiley and hindawi, complement each other has to do with the exploitation of that scale, which we've talked about in a variety of calls. researchers want to get their research out to the world in the best possible journal as quickly as they can, in that order. and so what they do is they choose a journal, want to say, one of our leading health science journals, and they submit it to that journal.
sometimes that article gets accepted, sometimes it gets rejected. if it gets rejected, the author is forced to resubmit that journal somewhere else. to the extent that we, in our portfolio, have a high-quality journal that fits that article better, we can move the article from journal 1 to journal 2 or to journal 3 or to journal 4, and we can do it quickly and seamlessly. and this is an important part of our strategy, thereby allowing the researchers to get their article out faster.
so i think you know, dan, we today publish about 25% of the articles that we receive. we believe that there is the opportunity to publish that even more -- to publish even more, greater percentage, significantly greater percentage of those articles. we know this because those articles get published elsewhere, and so we track them, and we see that a large portion of the articles that we reject get published elsewhere. so if we have an apex or very high-quality title, and then we have an aligned set of journals, and that's what hindawi does, it aligns with our journals in these high-demand disciplines extremely well, and they're not just journals that are unrelated to our journal, that was one of the great pieces of synergy we identified, then we can run a higher percentage of the submissions through publication.
and as you know, in the oa p times q model, then we can monetize those even better. so scale really matters and high-quality scale matters. so you'll see a publisher like us with a high-quality portfolio of titles aligned with a good cascade mechanism, we do very well. the second way is that hindawi is also a very -- has a very strong process that was uniquely created and tailored to the open access experience.
that's a platform and its processes, whereby which they can process an open access article much faster than is typically the norm in the industry. and that process helps us at wiley to have greater author satisfaction because they want to get it out there quickly, they want to get their article there quickly. and so we can take those lessons and move them across wiley, both the platform and the processes that allow us to enhance the wiley platforms and processes. conversely, we have many platforms in content management that are far more advanced than what hindawi, as a small company, could possibly have invested in.
so we can bring those efficiencies in content management and so forth to hindawi. and then, of course, we have a very successful corporate -- a very successful research platforms business built on our literatum platform that is sold to publishers and societies around the world. and we have a very successful solutions business, where by which we support societies and publishers in their efforts. and we can take those great hindawi assets and we can add them to our assets to have an even more robust offering out there in the marketplace.
so this really is a case where we can take full advantage of hindawi, hindawi can take full advantage of us, and we can go forward into the open access world with really an unmatched set of capabilities. so very exciting. and as you know, as we move toward the oa p times q model, there's a lot of opportunity to the extent we can attach ourselves more closely to the consistent growing article submission rate that happens around the world every year, where the submissions grow in high single digits every year.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. and i just want to confirm. i think you did say dilutive for the year by $0.15, and that included $0.12 in fiscal q3. is that right, john?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
yes, that's correct, dan.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. and i don't want to push you, but do you see the potential at least for the deal to be maybe accretive on it a little faster than your fiscal '23 goal? or are there discrete investments that you intend to continue to make around it?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
i think it's a little early for us to call, dan. we've only had the team on board with us now for two months. we feel very good about the progress that we are making and the rate at which the business will grow. so we can give you an update on that when we come back around with our expectations for fiscal '22 in june.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
sounds good. switching gears, education services margins, once again, really strong, easily exceeding the 15% goal. i'm wondering if you don't see maybe a little bit of that goal as being modestly conservative? or do you see an opportunity to perhaps accelerate investment given the strong results we've seen?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, it's a great question, and i can certainly understand why you're asking. the answer is, we have a growth business here, a growth business in a changing market. we are a leader.
we intend to continue to be a leader, and we continue to treat it as a profitable growth business. at 15%, we are very comfortable at that 15%-plus number that we've put out there for a long time, and we're gonna continue to look for opportunities to invest to keep our growth rate good and higher. as you know, this is a business that is at a higher profitability rate than ever before, and we are very, very pleased with that. but we also recognize that the huge potential that exists in the transformation of education from traditional to hybrid and online, and in many ways, this is our moment to capitalize on that.
and we need to be targeting those opportunities to bring on new partners, to stand them up, to make them successful and to ultimately grow our enrollment and the breadth of our services that we provide to those people. so i think we're gonna stick with 15% plus is the answer.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
understood. certainly makes sense. and maybe one more, and i'll jump back in queue. academic and professional learning, i think, as we said, it looks like courseware is now offsetting the declines in print.
just talk maybe about your confidence in that on a go-forward basis. and similarly, in professional learning, with the vaccines accelerating, it sounds like your corporate professional partners are feeling a little bit better. any more color or commentary there would be really helpful.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
both good questions. so with respect to the education publishing side, we really are optimistic about the trajectory and what i called in my comments, the maturation of the digital courseware market. we're very pleased with our offerings. we feel very strongly about them, and we love the trajectory that we're on.
having said that, we still have a good portion of our business that's print, and print will continue to decline. the good news is that we are gaining units dramatically and unit share. so while we're not ready to call bottom in terms of that trajectory, we do like where it's going. we're exceeding -- we are increasingly optimistic.
and it's always a great temptation to say now is the moment, but i think what we can say is we have a business that is moving definitively in the right direction, where the price/value proposition has normalized to an extent that people are buying the products that we are selling instead of looking for alternatives or substitutes. and if the growth rate of zybooks isn't an example of that, i don't know what is. so we are feeling good about it. and so we're gonna avoid a specific statement about an inflection point per se, but the trends are going definitively in the right direction.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. and then, on the professional side, sounds like you're seeing some green shoots there as well.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, forgot it. sorry, i forgot part 2. the professional learning is most definitely rebounding. as you may recall, we were down up to 70% in our businesses that support in-person training in the beginning, and we were very worried about corporate budgets and the like.
and what we're seeing is that our retention rate and our upsell rate in our corporate e-learning business is very good. and so we're -- it's been a little troubling for companies as they've been trying to look out into the future. but we had some concern, as you know, about what happened when we cross into calendar-year '21. but in fact, our upsells and our retention have remained high, and our pipeline looks very good.
and in the parts of our business that support in-person training, that part that was down 70%, we are now back up to between 80% and 90% of where we were before, which is terrific given that we're still in a significant covid situation. and one of the main reasons that we're there is that 85% of our trainings are now done virtually. so yes, it's bouncing back on both sides. we like those businesses -- those parts of our business.
they're gonna continue to do well and come back, and i think we're really on the right trajectory. but also, this movement toward virtual team training and virtual professional development, which used to require an instructor in front of a classroom, that's a really optimistic development for those businesses. and frankly, it has far exceeded -- that transition has far exceeded my expectation spurred by covid. i don't think we would have moved anywhere near as fast there.
so once we get back -- obviously, we need to get back to where we were before and 85% in the 100%. but i'm really pleased because, obviously, when we go digital, we not only have a business that moves into more sustainable and recurring revenue models, but great profitability. and also, we can reach much larger audiences when you don't have to get a bunch of people together in classrooms. so again, we're not exactly where we want to be, and you can see by the segment financials.
but the trajectory, again, is where we want to go and consistent and aligned with the wiley strategy.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
really helpful. i'll pass it off and circle -- perhaps circle back if there are no others. thank you again.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from greg pendy from sidoti. your line is open.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. can you -- i guess, first off, can you help us understand a little bit around the swings in accounts receivable? they seem to have spiked in 2q and then came way down in 3q. can you give us a little color on that on a year-over-year basis, i'm talking?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
so you're looking at the comparison back to year-end april, is that what you're comparing?
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
correct, yeah, i'm just trying to gauge the seasonality of -- you had a large spike on a year-over-year basis in receivables in 2q. and on a year-over-year basis, it looks like it came way down. just kind of trying to triangulate that with where you might end up the year in receivables so that i understand your cash flow guidance a little bit better.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
so there is a good bit of seasonality to our receivables and a lot of that seasonality swings around the timing of our subscription renewal season, as well as we've introduced some other elements to our business, the addition of mthree and hindawi to our business. so there are some things that are gonna inorganically move around our receivable balances as well. what i would say is that you should be aware that from a collections perspective, our collections performance continues to be strong. we have not encountered any significant issues in terms of defaults.
we do have a little bit of upward pressure on receivables coming from some of our customers who are, particularly on the library side, struggling a bit with budget challenges and so have had challenges around payment schedules. so we've extended, in rare cases, the payment periods for our customers, try to be accommodating to their particular budget challenges. but overall, most of what you're seeing is seasonality, as i said. and what you're not seeing, i want to be really clear about, is any risks around collectibility.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
understood. and then, just switching gears, just trying to understand that new student growth and just kind of -- if you could give us a little bit more color behind why -- i think you said it was 29% up. and just trying to understand, is that reflective in addition of some of the new account wins? or -- and just trying to understand, do you think those will be full-time students, or is there gonna be maybe a lower retention rate given covid-19 on that new student spike?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, super question. the first thing i'll say is answer the last bit. we have exceedingly high retention rates through to graduation in our online programs. it has been consistent throughout the period leading up to covid and through covid.
we've see no evidence that there would be any increase in deterioration of our retention rate in the go-forward period. so we're very pleased. and by the way, we're really proud of that because we're in the business of getting people degrees, affordable degrees that get them jobs. and so to the extent that we, as a company, don't focus on impact first, we will lose and our clients will lose and the students will lose, and that's unacceptable.
so now where is it coming from? the answer is it's -- certainly, our new clients are -- will take a little while to stand up. there's always -- there are always new clients coming online. and inside new clients, we are always adding new programs. and then, most importantly, we're trying to grow those programs that we do have, the degree programs.
and that's where it's coming from, right? it's really coming from the existing clients and the existing programs. to be sure, we're always adding new ones, but that's not the core here. the core is endemic underlying growth in interest in online education and in the success with which we are finding students efficiently and effectively, which is what drives our terrific profitability. we find them efficiently, effectively.
we match them up with a program that works for them at a university that works for them, and we ensure that they are successful through to graduation. so this is not some cyclical or covid-related sort of move, this is the way we've been over time. having said that, of course, covid has accelerated the interest in online degrees, but we believe a large part of that is permanent and much remains to be seen. so there's -- that will be sorted out as we get toward next year and so forth.
but once you're in the program, we expect retention rates that are as outstanding as the retention rates we have always delivered to our clients and to students.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. and then, just one final one, just trying to understand the 25% published article percentage. and i appreciate all the color on hindawi. but also, if i'm not mistaken, some of the opportunities were missed in the past, was it due to not having the right systems in place to find where that article might land, and that's why you sort of lost that article opportunity? i don't want to throw the word ai, but i believe you're building a system that would hopefully identify a -- where some of these submissions could go.
is that correct? and where are you -- if so, where are you in the process?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the topic is a really important topic. i would not agree that we lost or missed opportunities. what i would say is that there is an unexploited opportunity that has always existed for all publishers and exists for us to do a better job.
we've been on a pathway from the old print world where you had a limited number of articles that you could squeeze between two pages and ship out the people to the digital world where there's sort of unlimited shelf space. and through that process, the editorial standards must remain high. but with the high editorial standards, we want to try to find a home for all those articles. i think 25% is just a fine rate, but it's not good enough.
it's not -- so i wouldn't characterize it as a deficit, which really, for us, it's an unexploited opportunity. and yeah, you're absolutely right, we are working very hard to make the process -- to organize ourselves develop the systems, including ai-driven submissions and editorial review systems, that allow us to process articles faster and to route them to the appropriate journal faster. and then, should they be rejected by that journal, send them on to their next journal and ask people -- the author's permission for submission to another journal. we're absolutely investing in that.
you're absolutely right to focus on. it's hugely important, and we do think that there's that big opportunity, and it's a source of significant investment for us. when we do it, we gain a higher return on investment because we publish a higher percentage of articles, but we also make the authors happy. this is what they want, right? they don't want to have to go to another multi-month process of submitting it to another journal where they have to get the review.
and i would also agree with you that in the past, we haven't been and all publishers haven't been as efficient as they could be. and we're also moving from a largely manual process to a very much automated process, which is the point that you very wisely underlined, and that automated process is a source of great focus for us and great opportunity going forward.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst

i'll now turn the call over to wiley's president and ceo, brian napack. 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. i want to start by acknowledging our colleagues, customers, and partners in india, sri lanka, and brazil, and elsewhere around the world where they are still struggling mightily with covid-19. we all look forward to a day when this terrible crisis is behind us. this past year's profound health economic and social challenges continue to remind us, wiley, of the importance of what we do.
we enable scientific and medical discovery, we power education, and we shape the workforce of tomorrow. to our work, wiley, as a business, is committed to unlocking human potential, which we need now more than ever. fiscal '21 was a good year for wiley. our consistent strategic focus on open research and career-connected education paid off, and we saw strong financial performance and increasing momentum.
our markets began to emerge from long periods of transition, and they demonstrated strong demand for fully differentiated digital products and services and for business models that work for both wiley and for our customers. long-term trends, such as open access and online education were pulled forward by the crisis, clarifying what the future of research and education will look like and strengthening our growth outlook. wiley's execution in this most challenging year was exceptional. our team around the world adapted well to a fully virtual work environment and very fast-changing market conditions.
they took good care of our customers during a time of great need, while continuing to drive our strategy forward and improve our operation. notably, our colleague engagement worldwide has risen significantly during this period. one reason for the high engagement is our people's deep belief and the unique impact that they have on society year in and year out. the more researchers and learners we help to succeed, the greater the impact.
and there was a lot of opportunity for impact this year. overall, fiscal '21 was a year in which we continued to execute on our strategy and in which the market told us that we were on the right track. long-term opportunities are expanding in open research and career-connected education, and we're going after them. during the year, we saw the acceleration of three long-standing trends that define our market.
the shift toward open research, the migration toward online and hybrid education in both university and corporate settings, and the increased adoption of digital tools and courseware for learners. as you know, wiley's strategies are tightly aligned with these trends. we're capitalizing strongly on the growth of open research, where revenue is a direct function of the quantity of articles published in the price we charge. we realized significant volume gains in fiscal '21 based on the quality and breadth of our journals and on the excellent performance of our strategic read and publish agreements.
these volume gains are driving double-digit oa revenue growth. the demand for online degrees and credentials accelerated significantly through the year, hastened by the pandemic. as it did, wiley's network of leading universities and corporate partners enabled learners to improve their career prospects through education. consequently, enrollment was up significantly.
wiley has long been a strategic partner for both universities and corporations and our services were in high demand as institutions plan for their hybrid futures. this move to digital education also drove an accelerated shift toward digital curriculum. our volumes were up significantly as digital courseware product, such as the highly effective zybooks line, emerged as the preferred learning toolset in today's world of anytime, anywhere education. wiley is the leader in digital courseware, and we continue to realize significant growth in adoptions and usage.
as the market goes increasingly nontraditional, new opportunities are opening up for companies like wiley that can deliver for learners, wherever and whenever they choose to learn. at wiley, we are highly motivated by our environmental and social responsibilities, both in our core lines of business and as a global corporate citizen. in february, we signed the un global compact, a pledge to drive business action in support of achieving specific sustainable development goals by 2030. as the company committed to research and education, wiley's growth strategies themselves have impact, and our success leads to ever greater societal benefit.
for example, the rapid growth of open research output means that more cutting-edge knowledge is being delivered to the world faster and more openly, so it can have more impact. the same can be said for our work in education, where the growing reach of our career-connected offerings leads directly to unlocking career potential from millions of learners, many of whom would not have otherwise had access to the opportunity. across wiley, we're always looking for ways to increase access and lower costs for those most in need. one example is our longtime partnership with research4life.
through which we provide free or low-cost access to our content in developing countries. more broadly, wiley's work to ensure a vibrant research ecosystem directly advances the un sustainable development goals in areas such as good health and well-being, in climate action. wiley is also finding ways to improve access to high-impact education from lowering the cost of courseware, which we've been doing, to delivering faster and more targeted career credentials, to extending our footprint in underserved markets. our mthree technology career program in india, for example, targets that risk population such as candidates who are the first in their family to access higher education.
and it targets those from households earning less than $500 a month. notably, over half of our candidates for credentials in india are women. by actively targeting impact in this way, wiley is helping to fulfill un sustainable development goals for quality education and reduced inequality. we're pleased to report that wiley achieved carbon-neutral certification for fiscal '20, and our fiscal '21 measurements are now getting under way.
as a predominantly digital company, we will continue to drive reductions in our carbon emissions by reducing the company's production of printed products, such as books and journals, and by pursuing a broad green plan. during the year, i signed the ceo action for diversity and inclusion. the ceo action is a significant commitment to sustained, concrete action that advances thinking, behavior, and business practices in the workplace. wiley also proudly received an a grade in the msci esg ratings report and a perfect score from the human rights foundation for lgbtq workplace equality.
at an industry level, as the chairman of the association of american publishers, i am personally advancing two ambitious initiatives industrywide, one on sustainability and the other on be&i. wiley will continue to drive impact, both as an enabler of discovery and learning and through corporate responsibility across our global footprint. now i'll review our results for the quarter and then for the year. the team delivered another quarter of strong execution and performance.
revenue rose by 10%, adjusted ebitda by 21% and eps -- adjusted eps by 41%. research revenue for the quarter was up 9%, 4% organically, driven by continued momentum in open access, corporate solutions, and research platforms. apl grew 12%, largely by strong demand for content and courseware across both education, publishing, and professional learning. this growth was helped by an accelerating recovery in corporate training.
education services rose 7%, driven by growth in degree program enrollment and three job placements. earnings growth was largely fueled by strong profit performance in apl and ed services, driven by both revenue growth and significant cost structure improvements. this offset a decline in research due to investments in editorial capacity to fuel our further growth and higher annual incentive compensation related to fiscal '21 performance. for the year, wiley reported strong growth across all financial metrics.
revenue was up 4%; adjusted ebitda up, 16%; and adjusted eps, up 27%. free cash flow for the year was up 48% to a historical high of $257 million. as you can see, it was a good year, especially in light of the considerable covid-related disruptions. john will walk you through the cash flow and capital allocation later in the presentation.
i'll now turn to our segment performance. wiley research delivered another strong year with revenue up 5% or 3% organically. this was fueled by consistent execution of our strategy to take advantage of the increasing global demand to publish and to access research. adjusted ebitda rose 6% for full-year ebitda margin of 35%.
research article output continues to grow nicely. this volume growth, supported by strong open-access pricing power, resulted in double-digit growth in our oa revenue. this oa growth more than offset modest pricing pressure that we saw in our subscription business due to covid's impact on library budgets. our strategic read and publish agreements, what we sometimes refer to as transitional agreements, continue to contribute to robust growth in publishing volume.
during fiscal '21, we signed multiyear agreements with consortia in italy, ireland, spain, and switzerland. in wiley, the innovative oa publisher we acquired in december is already adding significant value as we integrate its fast-growing collection of 200 journals. as noted, we anticipate significant revenue synergies from the expansion of our journal portfolio and by offering a broader range of platforms and services to our existing society and publishing partners. we are well along in the integration of hindawi, and it is going very well.
wiley research is also seeing continued strong momentum from our platform, corporate solutions, and society publishing partners. of note is the success we're seeing in the career centers that we manage for corporate and society partners. we recently signed up glaxosmithkline and pfizer, among others. we're also seeing continued success in the addition of the new society publishing business with net wins for calendar year '21 were over $10 million annually.
other noteworthy developments in research from the past year include the following. in just 12 months, literatum usage grew by 31% to 4.6 billion user sessions, while the platform maintained a 98% client retention rate. we're increasingly leveraging our broad product offering in publishing and platforms to build expansive new partnerships with major societies such as the chinese medical association publishing house and the american association for the advancement of science or the aaas. during the year, we continue to build our proprietary journal portfolio, including launching a major new flagship journal called natural sciences, which we created in partnership with the influential projekt deal consortium out of germany.
we're very excited about the potential of this journal. internally, it's critical that we don't take our eye off the optimization ball. through fiscal '21, we continued to make significant gains in the efficiency of our publishing operations while supporting our unprecedented volume growth. over the past few years, wiley took a strong position to stand as a strong ally to the evolving research sector.
we chose to be bold and to move deliberately toward new publishing models and platforms, actively pursuing strategies that align us with the market and that put the researcher first. the result has been a steady upward revenue trajectory, from 2% organic in fiscal '20 to mid-single growth outlook for fiscal '22. from where we set, market trends remain favorable. scientific research investment and output continue to grow nicely, and research is increasingly integrated into both corporate strategy and government policy around the world.
the most important macro indicator, global r&d spending, is forecast to rise by 5% in calendar '21. demand to publish peer-reviewed research will continue to be very strong and access to that research is essential. looking forward, wiley is in a great position to meet the growing needs of the global research ecosystem. now on to academic and professional learning.
i'm pleased to report that our education publishing business returned to modest growth this year. it did so due to the combination of a winning publishing platform, favorable market dynamics, and consistent customer-centric strategies, which include the multiyear build-out of our courseware portfolio and a tight focus on high-demand disciplines and careers such as tech education. in professional learning, we continue to see steady recovery from the impact of covid, driven by strong momentum in our professional publishing program, and by the continuing recovery of corporate training. that said, covid was highly disruptive to in-person corporate training and test prep, and we had to navigate through that.
though the year, apl revenue was down 2%, although the fourth quarter saw a growth of 12% compared to the covid impact in the fourth quarter of last year. adjusted ebitda accelerated in the second half of the year, driven by revenue performance and gains from optimization. we finished at 4% and a full-year ebitda margin of 25%. other apl highlights from the year include the following.
our wileyplus platform recorded 1 million activations for the first time and revenue from our zybooks program increased by over 50%, now with over 400,000 subscribers. we launched a partnership with southern new hampshire university, the largest nonprofit provider of higher education in the united states with 175,000 students. together, we are redesigning their mba program to allow learners to complete their degree in one year at a materially lower cost. this is a good example of wiley's broad ability to help universities succeed by supporting their evolution with great content, great services, and leading-edge innovation.
finally, i'm happy to say that our well-known dummies franchise grew 9%, confirming the long-standing appeal of this customer -- of this consumer-focused brand for many millions of learners. we've been quite deliberate in our strategy to grow and optimize economic and professional learning. and i'm pleased to say that we expect a return to growth in fiscal '22. it's too early to comment on fall enrollment, except to say that we don't anticipate the same undergraduate enrollment headwinds that we saw last year despite some covid-induced uncertainty that remains in the system.
we expect to have a better view of enrollment as we get closer to the start of the school year in the fall. while it is hard to predict the post-covid future, it is clear that the transition to online learning will continue to drive the increasing adoption of digital content in courseware in both academic and corporate settings. professors and students alike are now beyond the tipping point and are readily adopting and implementing fairly priced digital programs to support their learning journey. and corporate leaders are increasingly focused on the real-time development of their teams to fill skill gaps, which is similarly driving demand for digital content and platforms.
all this bodes well for our apl offerings as the labor market drives an increasing need for wiley's career-connected content and services. fiscal '21 was also a good year for ed services segment, with covid as a contributor to online enrollment. for the year, revenue rose 21%, 7% organically, powered by 14% growth in student enrollment and 20% growth in new student starts. adjusted ebitda more than doubled this year as our focus on optimizing the student journey from lead to graduation began to pay off.
we finished with a full-year ebitda margin of 18%, up from 9% last year. beyond our strong financial performance, we saw a number of other notable achievements during the year. the team signed eight full-service institutional partnerships, including the university of montana, la trobe university in australia, tel aviv university in israel, in this quarter, norwich university in vermont. we also added important partnerships for unbundled services with new york university and the university of wyoming.
building the online catalogs of our existing partners is always a top priority, and we added over 40 new degree programs at existing partner schools in areas ranging from business and healthcare to computer science and public administration. despite covid headwinds in the early stages of the pandemic, we've gained momentum with mthree through the year as corporate demand for tech talent accelerated. in the fourth quarter, we signed four major global corporations following three that we signed in the third quarter. we also delivered record placements with existing fortune 100 customers.
we head into fiscal '22 with great momentum here. the pipeline is strong and we're expanding in new markets as a global player. around the world, demand continues to grow for high-quality, career-focused online degrees and job-ready talent. over the past few years, we've been focused on meeting the needs -- these needs by building a solid foundation for durable profitable growth and services.
this begins with delivering an exceptional value proposition to our university and corporate partners. it also means serving them efficiently and profitably, which is what we are doing. we've raised our ebitda margin from 3% in fiscal '19 to 18% in fiscal '21, while also achieving significant revenue growth. with this foundation in place, we can set our sights on meeting demand with low teens organic revenue growth expected in fiscal '22, up from 7% this year.
looking ahead, we expect universities to continue to actively transition to hybrid online degree delivery and we will continue to enable their success by delivering high-impact learning experiences. we expect demand to remain strong for academic credentials as students and professionals look to differentiate themselves in a competitive labor market. this will include increasing demands for new forms of targeted credentials that are quicker to get, more affordable, and that give workers the precise skills they need to succeed. the pandemic has only accelerated the need to close the talent gap, whether by helping our university partners deliver graduates that can hit the ground running or by helping corporations to identify, train, and place great talent.
wiley will play a major role in creating the labor force for the post-pandemic economy. i'll now pass the call over to john for more detail on our financial results.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. as brian noted, the wiley team has made significant progress in refining and executing our growth strategies while also driving important gains in operational efficiency and effectiveness. our improved revenue and profitability in the fiscal year 2021 are clear evidence of our strong momentum. following an extended period of limited revenue growth, we now anticipate organic revenue growth of 5% or more in the coming year.
we will continue to invest in the expanding opportunities in our markets. in research, we will publish more to meet global demand, leveraging hindawi to drive open-access revenue synergies, and we will go broader publishing and platform offerings for societies and corporations. in career-connected education, we will continue to expand our online degree programs and drive online enrollment, scale our digital courseware portfolio, and expand the it talent development pipeline along with our base of corporate clients. finally, in our relentless pursuit of operational excellence, we will continue to expand publishing capacity and workflow automation, drive student acquisition improvements, and enhance our direct-to-consumer capabilities, including our e-commerce experience.
looking ahead now to fiscal '22' total wiley revenue is expected to exceed $2 billion for the first time in our history, growing by mid-to-high single digits to a range of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion. for the year, we anticipate revenue growth in all three segments, including mid-to-high single-digit growth for research, low single-digit growth for academic and professional learning, and low teens growth for education services. adjusted ebitda is expected to range between $415 million and $435 million, with profit gains on higher revenue tempered by investments to accelerate growth in research and education services accompanied by higher t&e expenses due to the resumption of in-person business activities. adjusted eps is anticipated to range between $2.80 and $3.05, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to investments and acquisitions, along with a higher effective tax rate.
capital expenditures, including technology, property, and equipment, and product development spending are expected to range between $120 million and $130 million, compared to $103 million in fiscal '21 as we invest in the previously noted growth initiatives. wiley's free cash flow generation will remain strong although we will continue to see some variances from year to year. wiley generated $173 million of free cash flow in fiscal '20 and $257 million in fiscal '21. fiscal '21 performance was driven by strong cash earnings, lower capex, and a $21 million cares act-related tax refund reported in q2 and received in q3.
looking ahead to fiscal '22, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $200 million to $220 million. while cash earnings are again expected to be strong, we see certain headwinds as compared to fiscal '21, including $20 million to $30 million higher capex in fiscal '22, higher net cash taxes in fiscal '22 due to the cares act-related tax refund received in fiscal '21, and higher annual incentive compensation payments to be issued in the first quarter of fiscal '22 for our both target performance in fiscal '21. our strong balance sheet and cash flows over time enable us to confidently invest, acquire, and return cash to shareholders. as previously noted, fiscal '21 free cash flow of $257 million was 48% higher than the prior year.
capex was $103 million for the year, $12 million lower than the prior year due to delayed investment in the early days of covid. as a reminder, we acquired oa publisher, hindawi, this year for $298 million. as we noted at the time of acquisition, hindawi's attractive financial profile includes strong double-digit revenue growth and ebitda margins in excess of 40%. our net debt-to-ebitda ratio, inclusive of the hindawi acquisition, was 1.7 at the end of april, compared to 1.6 last year.
our strong cash flow for the year complements a healthy balance sheet, with more than $90 million of cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit capacity in excess of $660 million at year-end. approximately 30% of our free cash flow was allocated to the dividend this year, and the dividend was raised for the 27th consecutive year. our current dividend yield is a little over 2%. and finally, share purchases were lower due to cash conservation in the early months of covid.
since resuming repurchases in january, we acquired approximately 310,000 shares at an average cost per share of $50.93. notwithstanding the reduced level of share repurchases this year, wiley maintained its strong track record of returning cash to shareholders with dividends and share repurchases totaling $93 million. i'll now turn the call back to brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. let me quickly summarize the key takeaways before i open it up to q&a. fiscal '21 was a good year overall for wiley as our growth strategies in open research and career-connected education took firm root. these growth strategies continue to benefit from long-term market trends, which have been pulled forward significantly in the past year.
so despite covid-related headwinds, these strategies and favorable market dynamics drove strong performance and increasing momentum across the company. we expect long-term opportunities to expand in open research, online education, and digital curriculum. nonetheless, we must remain focused and vigilant as we step forward into the uncharted post-pandemic world. that said, we play in fundamentally good markets.
and at our core, wiley remains a very strong company with exceptional brands, a solid financial position, and powerful growth engine. and as an impact company, we're powering discovery and learning worldwide, and through this, unlocking human potential. all of us at wiley are very proud of our purpose, and we're highly motivated to expand our impact by doing whatever we can to increase the success of our millions and millions of learners and researchers around the globe. in closing, i want to thank our wonderful wiley colleagues for their truly remarkable accomplishments this past year.
they demonstrated resilience and a dedication to each other and also to our mission. they delivered results for our customers and our shareholders, all in the face of significant disruption. i'm very proud to work with each and every one of them. i'll now open the floor to any comments and questions.Â

[operator instructions] your first question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities. your line is open. you may ask your question.Â 
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
brian, john, good morning. thanks for the color and thanks for taking the questions.Â 
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
good morning.Â 
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
start with the -- obviously, the top-line outlook is really encouraging generally across the board. start with research where you raised the outlook to mid to high single-digit growth. first, i guess, it looks like price -- any lingering pricing pressure from colleges and universities from covid seems to be abating. is that correct? and second, are you seeing -- is the increase largely from open access accelerating? and then i have a quick follow-up on publishing as well.Â 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. look, dan, it's a great question because, ultimately, our future is defined by the health of our publishing programs and the balance between our subscription businesses and our oa. i would not say that the pricing pressure has abated because the university ecosystems worldwide continue to be under significant financial pressure. having said that, what the last year has demonstrated is that our research or high-quality essential content are something that library and universities are simply not willing to go without.
so we expect to see some continued financial pressure. but again, what we've said many times is that that pressure will be modest, and it will continue to be more than offset by the second half item that you referenced, which is our oa growth, which we continue to see significant growth in, with submissions up in the, you know, in the upwards of 20% and output up in the mid-teens. and as that happens, we move, as you know, to a p times q environment, that continues to drive revenue growth in a very direct way, especially considering, as i've noted a number of times, the very solid pricing power that we have due to the high quality of our journal portfolio. so i wouldn't say that the tough times are over for universities.
and i think we're going to have to continue to work with them affirmatively like we did last year when we went out with a 0% price increase. you know, that's going through our p&l this year, 0% price increase. and certainly, certain institutions where research is somehow less essential, they might have been a little bit of a -- a little bit more pressure. but overall, our customer base and the renewal rates are extremely high, both on a gross and a net basis.
so we're very pleased with where we're coming out of this. and of course, as we move forward, it's all about the quality and the volume of our publishing program, which both undergirds our traditional subscription business and fuels the growth engine that oa has become for us.Â 
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
and that's great color. switching gears to academic and professional learning. you know, what kind of assumption are we -- or projection are we making for if you just sort of isolate textbook portion of the business in terms of the guide, and how much of rebound of recovery are you experiencing in corporate and professional learning? you touched on it, but any more color there would be great.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
sure. sure. so we have had this -- the academic content business, which is, you know, sort of rightly referred to as the textbook business, has been in a period of transition for a long time. but it really is no longer the textbook business.
it really is the digital content and courseware business now where well over 50% of our revenue comes from digital units. that's important to note. we are seeing significant growth in our digital units. we're seeing growth in our digital revenues.
and we'll continue to see some pressure in the print parts of the business which we never expect or at least not for the next few years to go away completely. but the uptake that we've seen in the digital content courseware, which is becoming the norm, it's becoming the standard, and this last year just proved that because it did not only force people to go digital, it actually proved to them the value of these powerful digital, interactive, personalized products where you can measure impact and you can learn wherever and whenever you want. i guess it's a long-winded way of saying we'd like the future of that business, and we'd like -- because the high-quality content that we produce is absolutely essential to what they do, and it has been proven over and over again. so now that we're through the transitions, we expect the business to behave like a, you know, like a modest -- low to modest growth business and to be, you know, nice and profitable along the way.
does that address your question, dan, on that part of it, on [inaudible] corporate part?
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
yes, absolutely. and maybe, you know, corporate reopening as covid abates.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so corporate is an interesting -- there's an interesting set of dynamics going on in corporate. and it's really driven more by the skill gap and by the need to get teams to be highly functioning and to get individuals to be highly performing. and what we saw in the last year was super interesting.
so when we had a business -- we have a business that supports in-person training very directly as you know. and needless to say, without any in-person, there was no in-person training. but what happened during the pandemic was quite fascinating in that there was a dramatic shift toward the virtualization of those in-person training. and at this point, well over 80% of our trainings remain virtual, even as we're going back because, again, people have realized, this is what we mean by when we say the trends are pulled forward.
they were trends. they were pulled forward. and now, people are realizing, wow, i can touch more people, have a more regular interaction, more regular trainings, upskilling as part of my day-to-day job. so that has come back quite nicely even as the in-person part of it has continued to be -- it's growing quite well, but it's growing well compared with covid load.
but we're seeing this virtual aspect to it and the digital aspect to it adding significant more tam if you will because there -- because now i can make learning part of more people's lives in their jobs and do that throughout the year as opposed to just on single days where i have in-person training. so it's starting to come back. it's not yet back at 100% that part of the business. but overall, this segment is an essential part of the economy that we're positioned very well to participate in.
operator
your next question comes from the line of greg pendy with sidoti. your line is open.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to make sure i understood that correctly. when you said the trend has pulled forward, but for the education and publishing and professional learning segment, is it fair to say that the low single-digit guidance, the cadence throughout the year will probably be front-end weighted just because of the test prep trends during covid? is that correct?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
not 100% i understood the question. the -- what we're seeing in the test. go ahead if you want to clarify.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah. the low single-digit guidance for that division, i'm assuming it's going to be front-end weighted. the revenues will be higher in the first half just given the trends during covid kind of pushed a lot of test prep out. is that fair?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
look, right, the -- i think i understand. the future of the businesses that were most affected by covid, test prep is one of them and our in-person training -- corporate training businesses was the other. we will -- our recovery will be a direct function of the recovery of those sectors. i just touched on the in-person corporate training piece to say that it's growing nicely back from prior year's levels, both within the traditional fees where we're getting back to our pre-pandemic levels and also in the more new digital opportunities that are created by it.
and those will develop over time. so, yeah, as we recover there, you'll see a direct function of that recovery show through in our growth rates compared to the year-on-year bad periods. in test prep, the same dynamic holds, but it's a little less clear -- it's a little less clear how that -- how and when that's coming back because we still don't have a full-scale resumption of testing and the delivery of tests in test prep centers. as that comes back, we will track with it and we're not going to predict that on a -- on an individual-product-line basis here.
we obviously believe it's going to come back, and it is coming back at some level, but we will track that and we're -- we don't have pure visibility into when that's going to happen because it's a function of, you know, health conditions and things outside of our control.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
understood. that's very helpful. and then i just wanted to dig into just the -- was the education -- editor capacity that kind of ramped up in the research division. can you just give us a little bit of color on that, because it seems like, you know, you have some positive moving parts but the 40% ebitda of the hindawi acquisition coming in.
so, can you maybe give us a little bit of color on how to think about that and is it going to continue throughout 2022?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely. so, i can give you color on that and john can add to the answer that i will give you with some color if he feels like there's more to add. so, yeah, we saw an unprecedented surge in demand from the very beginning of the pandemic from what are already pretty high levels of demand.
the demand in the research business presents itself in the form of increased submissions and the requirements to evaluate those submissions and process them through the pipeline and a significant portion of our -- of the investment was keeping up with that demand. naturally, what you want to see is what we're doing which is we're investing heavily in the automation to streamline those processes. so, while now we've brought on significant capacity in order to meet that demand, in the long run, you should see and expect to see increased productivity as we process that pipeline in a more streamlined and automated fashion. we saw a growth opportunity, we did what we needed to do to capitalize on it, and that's what it comes down to.
now, in the longer run -- we are investing in people now, but in the long run, we're investing in automation and streamlining the processes in order to make sure that the profitability translates straight through -- or directly through continue the revenue translates more directly through the profitability. and the hindawi acquisition, you rightly note, is a net contributor to our profitability because they have pioneered some very efficient streamlined processes through -- and great systems for processing increased volume of open-access articles. john, is there anything you would add to that?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
yeah. i just would add, greg, when you're looking at the fourth-quarter results which i'm sure you see the dip in the ebitda margin, that is significantly driven by the item i mentioned with respect to annual incentive compensation and it being above target in the fourth quarter. that's significantly weighing on research results in the quarter. so, you know, we expect to head back in the direction of our trend line around ebitda margin in that business as the fourth quarter was again significantly impacted by incentive compensation.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. got it. and then just one final one. the real estate, the $8 million and -- i think run-rate savings, has that started in this quarter, or is that going to take a little bit of time till it starts to work its way?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
greg, we're under way there. we've been running the last couple of quarters about let's call it around $2 million a quarter in savings.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. perfect. all right. well, thanks a lot.
that's all i got.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
great. thank you.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we have a follow-up question from daniel moore with cjs securities. your line is open.
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
thank you again. i just wanted to get to the profitability portion of the guide. so, on a go-forward basis, you know, ebitda and eps guidance implies fairly modest incremental margins you laid out in detail, you know, obviously, incremental investments in research, as well as t&e. is there any way to quantify each of those to get a little bit better sense for the magnitude of each? and then secondly, hindawi, you know, i believe we expect it to be accretive by fiscal '23 on a gaap basis.
what kind of dilution are we looking out for fiscal '22 from hindawi?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
sure. so, --Â 
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
for eps.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thanks, daniel. so, sure. so, let me first respond to your comment overall about flow through on profitability. so, we are investing substantially both in research and in education services, all right? so, it's not just research, but we see important opportunities for strategic revenue growth across the business, but we've closed -- significantly we are investing in research and in education services.
and then along with that, we do see some pressure on t&e, call it single-digit millions of dollars because we're going to ease our way back into this. but we are going to get back into a more in-person business activity environment and that will drive some spending not only around travel but also around hosting some events that add value to the business. so, a combination of factors there. i do also want to call out significantly impacting our growth in eps is that we do have higher depreciation and amortization associated with investments and acquisitions.
and we are anticipating an increase in our effective tax rate from what was roughly 20.5% in fiscal year '21 to something that will be in the 22% to 23% sort of range. so, somewhere in that direction. with regard to hindawi, we had said that hindawi would be about $0.15 dilutive to eps in our fiscal year '21, and that's about where we ended up. we expect that that level of dilution will decline significantly in fiscal '22 and then be accretive to our earnings in fiscal '23 as we said before.
from a -- from an ebitda and cash flow perspective though, hindawi will be significantly accretive to wiley in fiscal year '22. so, we're on the track we had expected.
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
very helpful and i'm going to take a quick stab, you know, probably not but fascinated by the automation and the investments that you are making longer term. you know, any kind of margin benefit that you might be willing to discuss? or is it a little early or premature for that?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
well, --Â 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
dan.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
it's too early. go ahead, brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
no, you could take it. go ahead, john.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
yeah, i was going to say we're making these investments now and with the expectation that they will both improve our top-line growth. again, we see some really strong opportunities and they're reflected already in our top-line growth projections for fiscal '22. but we certainly also expect to drive efficiency gains. i would say most notably as brian commented on the research side, where we're going to, you know, drive process efficiency and automation in research that will help us grow rapidly in open access while managing the associated costs of that and improving our margin over time.
and so, there's some work to be done, but yes, we do expect that these investments are going to improve our margin along with that.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, dan, so what i wanted to add to that is we are on a long-term path to two things. one is to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the marketplace today. this gets to your earlier question as well. and these opportunities exist in research, they exist across all of our segments.
as you know, we feel very good about where our markets are going. but we're also investing in making these better businesses. and the good thing is the two things go together, in almost every case the two things go together. i mean, i won't do a litany of how, i'll just give you one or two examples.
we -- if we continue our investment apart from the short-term investment that i talked about earlier in terms of capitalizing on short-term opportunities, demand opportunities, as we invest in the automation of our research publishing processes, a number of really good things happen. the first thing that happens is obvious, right? we sort of move from manual processes to digital and automated, and ai-driven processes. that's good, but there's a lot of stuff that goes along with that. the investment in that automation also makes the process by definition faster, which is what the market wants, and also what we want because we get to put more through the system.
it also allows us to move. you know, we've talked about this issue of the cascade and the importance of being able to find a publishing home in our 17 -- or 1,900 journals for all high-quality research that deserves to be published. and automation allows us, dan, to take a, you know, a number that's published via sort of call it a quarter of our articles that we've published today and move that up incrementally while maintaining quality. because now, we have the ability to not just sort them efficiently and process them efficiently and edit them efficiently and produce them efficiently, but also to -- in automated, also in manual ways.
but in automated ways, to get them as quickly as we can to a home inside the portfolio, which sounds like an easy thing to do but it's actually quite hard. my point is that we are investing significantly in this -- in the process, in the infrastructure in order to make sure that the business gets better and more profitable at the same time. meaning better for the customers, better for us, and also generate profitability. this is why we're confident in not just the top-line outlook as we pivot toward growth.
but by pivoting toward growth, we're also improving the bottom-line outlook. i hope that's clear, dan.
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
yep. that's very helpful. and as i said at the outset that the, you know, trajectory of the business is really encouraging. so, i appreciate the color and i look forward to hearing more.Â 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
great. thank you.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thanks, dan.

operator
good morning, and welcome to wiley's first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to introduce wiley's vice president of investor relations, mr. brian campbell.
please go ahead.
brian campbell -- vice president, investor relations
hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. with me are brian napack, president and chief executive officer; and john kritzmacher, executive vice president and chief financial officer. a few reminders to start. the call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements.
you shouldn't rely on these statements as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our sec filings. the company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. also, wiley provides non-gaap measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends. these measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by u.s.
gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under gaap. unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-gaap metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency. after the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. i'll now turn the call over to wiley's president and ceo, brian napack. 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to our q1 earnings call. today, wiley is reporting another quarter of solid revenue growth across all segments. we continue to take advantage of strong demand for scientific research and career-connected education throughout the global economy. our performance underscores the tight alignment of our strategy to prevailing trends in the market and now more than ever, the critical importance of the work we do in powering discovery and learning worldwide.
simply stated, the more researchers and learners that wiley can help to succeed, the greater the positive societal impact. one point of example of this is in our talent development business, where today, we are filling the critical technology skill gap while also actively targeting the acute lack of diversity in the technology space overall. in partnership with our clients, we target underrepresented populations and train them so that they can get great jobs and succeed in those high demand, high-paying jobs with leading corporations. as a result of this specific focus on diversity and equity, the representation of people of color in our tech career placement programs is far above the national average.
from ensuring equity and hiring to making education more accessible through facilitating breakthrough climate research, wiley continues to have an outsized impact on society. across wiley, we're making substantial progress on esg and sustainability. wiley's diversity disclosure in our annual report was cited as a top example by a leading corporate governance authority, we recently earned a silver rating from ecovadis a leading sustainability ratings firm. this placed wiley in the top 25% of all companies assessed.
after achieving carbon neutrality in fiscal '20, we've kicked off our fiscal '21 carbon measurement initiative and have engaged a third party to guide us through the process of committing to and achieving science-based targets. despite lots of progress, we've got a long way to go in this journey, and we look forward to updating you regularly. now on to our q1 results. the team continues to execute well, and our performance reflects that, with revenue up 9% overall and 7% organically.
this revenue growth drove a 12% increase in adjusted ebitda and a 17% increase in adjusted eps. revenue growth was strong across all segments, with research up 10%, academic & professional up 7% and ed services up 13%. as a reminder, all variances exclude currency impact. simply stated, our strategy is on the mark for where the market is headed, and this was reflected in our q1 performance.
the long-term trends that we're pursuing continue to advance. here, of course, i'm talking about the shift toward open research, hybrid and online education and digital learning tools and courseware. further, the drive of corporations to fill the talent gap continues to be a great -- excuse me, continues to create a significant demand for wiley's career connected learning products and programs. in fact, we're seeing great momentum in our corporate offerings across research and education.
corporations alone showed strong demand for our research products to fuel innovation and they rely on our learning products and platforms to upskill their teams. increasingly, corporate leaders are coming to wiley for their talent development needs. and in fact, for job-ready talent to fill their critical skill gaps. looking ahead, the corporate customer is a clear and compelling opportunity.
earnings growth this quarter was largely fueled by strong profit performance in research and apl, mainly driven by revenue growth. this performance offset a profit decline in ed services due to higher marketing costs and university services and investment to expand client relationships in talent development. overall, we're pleased with how we started the year. however, covid remains -- related uncertainty remains a reality for now, particularly as it relates to university enrollment and related customer buying behavior as students and schools adapt to changing market conditions.
that said, we're confident in the ongoing strength and expansion of our core markets. at its core, wiley does three things: we enable discovery, we power life-changing education and we shape workforces. these three important areas of impact are central to human advancement, and we're deriving strong growth from each. we're enabling discovery through our leadership in open research, where we're making record volumes of new research freely available to the public.
the rise of open research publishing has accelerated research revenue growth overall. our strong growth this year is based on both the enduring draw of our journal brand and the execution of our open research strategy, including our multiyear read and publish agreements. this performance has been augmented by strong growth in our corporate lines of business, which include career centers, science databases and advertising to our very valuable audiences. we're powering education by delivering high-impact learning experiences and online degree programs that connect education directly to career outcomes.
wiley is helping institutions plan and deliver career-connected education and this is driving growth in our university services and digital courseware lines of business. and wiley is shaping the workforce by working with leading corporations to find, train and develop the talent they need to overcome the widening skill gap. demand for our talent development services is particularly strong now as corporations remain challenged by the war for talent and the persistent shortage of critical tech skills. our professional learning lines of business that deliver corporate training and professional publishing are seeing a strong recovery as corporations and professionals alike focus on upskilling to differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market.
let's take a look at our q1 performance by segment. wiley research delivered another good quarter with revenue up 10%, 5% of which was organic. our performance was driven by open research publishing, research platforms and corporate sales. adjusted ebitda rose 12% for a q1 ebitda margin of 37%.
research article output continues to grow nicely, although as expected, article submissions have slowed a bit from last year's covid-related spike. notably, underlying oa revenue growth was over 50%, including hindawi, our oa revenue nearly doubled. our multiyear read and publish agreements, often referred to as transformational agreement, continued to drive incremental volume growth this quarter. the pipeline remains strong for these mixed model deals, which provide full access for a client community to read and publish wiley's journals.
we continue to expand our major society partnerships, delivering a broad range of products and services that help them succeed, including research publishing, research platforms, author services and career services for the society's constituents. in august, we announced a landmark agreement with the society of hospital medicine to publish its industry-leading publications and to grow its career center. shm has more than 15,000 hospitalists as members. we recently launched a knowledge hub for gilead sciences that targets hiv specialists.
we also signed new career center partnerships with lexisnexis and with the institute of physics among others. going forward, there is a significant opportunity to upsell additional products, platforms and services to our unmatched network of societies and corporations. in summary, for research, there continues to be very good momentum and lots of opportunity for growth as we drive the transition to open research and expand our portfolio of partner solutions. i'm very pleased to report 7% organic growth this quarter for the academic & professional learning segment.
this was driven by 13% growth in professional learning compared to a covid-impacted last year. adjusted ebitda for the quarter rose 37% for q1 ebitda margin of 19%. this is up from 15% in the prior-year period. education publishing revenue rose modestly with continued strong growth in digital courseware and modest growth in print and digital content, both offsetting ongoing covid-related challenges in test prep.
as noted, covid continues to hinder visibility on full enrollment and student buying behavior. industry projections for enrollment range from flat to modestly down. the data remains limited thus far as we drive through the busy back-to-school season. note that in june, we sold our world languages publishing list to vista higher learning, a specialist in language learning.
this sale, although a small one, is a reflection of our important strategy to focus on highly -- high-demand skills and careers such as stem in business. professional learning saw strong growth in both professional publishing and corporate training, benefiting from favorable comparisons to prior year. corporate training continued to see a very strong recovery through both virtual and class delivery with revenue growth of 46% against the locked down q1 last year. finally, our cloud-based crossknowledge corporate learning platform also grew this quarter, albeit modestly, while signing 10 new corporate clients.
in summary, we're encouraged by our return to growth in apl as we continue to scale our digital courseware offerings and leverage our strong corporate relationships and professional learning brands. ed services reported 13% growth for the quarter, with university services up 8% and talent development up 34%. as a reminder, university services was formerly reported as opm and talent development as mthree. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 21% due to higher marketing costs in university services as competition increased for student leads and increased investment in talent development to accelerate the expansion of client relationships.
in our smallest quarter of the year for university services, adjusted ebitda margin was 9%. university services growth was driven by eight new partners we added last year, along with student enrollment growth. while no new partners were signed this quarter, we recently signed important renewals and added 13 new degree programs with existing partners. online enrollment was up 9% for the quarter, down from 14% we saw for the full fiscal-year '21.
we are seeing slower online enrollment growth compared to last year's covid-related spike. over the summer term, for example, we saw a lower rate of reenrollment compared to historical patterns and expect some of that to continue into the fall. this variability in enrollment pattern is to be expected as the system adapts to the ongoing impact of covid. as expected, we are seeing great momentum in talent development, where, as you know, wiley helps corporations identify, train, place and retain hard-to-find talent.
in the quarter, we signed three more multinational clients, including a leading financial services firm, a leading industrial services -- service areas company and a global retailer. these new clients are on top of the seven we signed in the previous two quarters. we also delivered record talent placements to our existing fortune 100 customers, such as morgan stanley, bank of america and many others. in a great example of our business model having impact, we recently launched a program with amazon canada to reskill warehouse workers and truck drivers with software development skills.
the goal of this program is to provide great new career path opportunities for these workers, even if this means that they gain skills that allow them to leave amazon to pursue higher potential careers. amazon, like many leading companies, knows that they need to provide career development opportunities to both attract and retain high-quality workers. we truly appreciate this forward-thinking socially positive partnership, and we're seeing real impact already. this is another clear example of the significant corporate opportunity that wiley is now tapping into.
the pipeline in talent development is strong, and we're expanding our reach into international markets such as india and australia. we're also making great progress in industries outside of our core financial services vertical. in summary, we're pleased with the growth of ed services as we continue to drive online enrollment growth and launch new degree programs in university services and as we sign major corporations and deliver record placements in talent development. again, we do anticipate some moderation of online enrollment growth this year as students return to physical campus and focus on their personal career path.
overall, it was a good quarter in which all three segments of wiley contributed to our revenue growth and to the achievement of our mission to unlock human potential. i'll pass the call over to john to take you through our financial position and outlook.
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. as brian noted, the wiley team continues to make good progress in executing our growth strategies and driving operational gains. free cash flow for the quarter was 25% better than prior year, driven by higher cash earnings and favorable working capital timing, partly offset by higher annual incentive compensation payments for our fiscal-year '21 performance. capex was $24 million for the quarter, modestly lower than prior year, and there were no acquisitions of note this quarter.
we continue to be active on the m&a front as we seek our capabilities in key strategic areas of research and career-connected education. our improved cash flow for the quarter complements a healthy balance sheet with more than $82 million of cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit capacity of more than $518 million at quarter end. our net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.0 at the end of july, consistent with prior year, even after funding the $298 million acquisition of hindawi last january. we allocated $27 million to dividends and share repurchases this quarter, up from $19 million in the prior year.
in june, we raised our dividend payout for the 28th consecutive year and our current dividend yield is around 2.4%. after taking a pause on share repurchases in the year-ago quarter, we acquired 130,000 shares this quarter at an average cost per share of $56.88, for a total spend of $7.4 million. our fiscal-year '22 business plan provides for important investments in our growth strategies and business optimization initiatives. in research, we will publish more to meet global demand, taking full advantages of our hindawi acquisition to advance our leadership position in open research.
we will also broaden our research publishing platform and service offerings for societies and corporations. in career-connected education, we will continue to expand our online degree programs, drive online enrollment, scale our digital courseware portfolio and expand the reach of our talent development services for corporations. we are also investing to drive operational excellence across the organization. we will continue to streamline, standardize and automate our workflows, particularly for publishing and for our back office operations.
on the customer-facing side, we will drive improvements in student acquisition and enhance our direct-to-consumer capabilities, including our e-commerce experience. as we noted in our earnings release, we are modifying our adjusted eps metric to exclude the impact of certain noncash items directly related to acquisitions, particularly the amortization of acquired intangibles. we do not consider these noncash amortization charges to be indicative of our ongoing operating and underlying performance. amortization of acquired intangibles amounted to $22 million in the first quarter or $17 million on a tax-adjusted basis, resulting in the newly defined adjusted eps of $0.85 per share, compared to $0.54 as it was formerly defined.
for fiscal '21 and fiscal '20, wiley's adjusted eps as it is newly defined was $4 and $3.30, respectively. going forward, we will only report on and guide to this newly defined adjusted eps metric. and finally, now onto our outlook, given the first-quarter performance and leading indicators, we are reaffirming our fiscal '22 guidance. total wiley revenue is expected to be up by mid- to high single digits to a range of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion.
adjusted ebitda is expected to range between $415 million and $435 million, with profit gains on higher revenue tempered by investments to accelerate growth initiatives. adjusted eps, as it is newly defined, is anticipated to range between $4 and $4.25, reflecting investments and a higher effective tax rate. again, this is a reaffirmation of our eps guidance, but now excludes the noncash amortization of acquired intangibles totaling $1.20 per share. free cash flow is expected to range between $200 million and $220 million.
while cash earnings are expected to be strong, we see certain headwinds compared to fiscal '21, including higher capex, higher net cash taxes and higher annual incentive compensation payments for fiscal '21. and one final note, current fx rates are relatively unchanged from the prevailing rates when we issued our guidance in june. and now i'll pass the call back to brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. let me quickly summarize key takeaways, and then we'll open it up to q&a. q1 was a good quarter for wiley, with strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by good performance across all segments. the long-term favorable trends that have defined our markets continue to march forward, including the shift to open research, the migration to hybrid and online education in both university and corporate settings, and the increased adoption of digital tools and courseware for learners.
also, the ever-growing need of corporations to fill critical skill and talent gaps. wiley's growth strategies are tightly aligned with these trends, and this is reflected in our current performance and full-year outlook. some variability remains from the pandemic as our global markets adapt to the new realities. nonetheless, we remain confident in our expanding markets and in wiley's outlook as we continue to meet the growing global need for research and education.

thank you, brian. [operator instructions] and our first question coming from mr. daniel moore of cjs securities. please go ahead, sir.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you, brian. thank you, john. good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
i want to start with research. as we look to calendar '22, and i realize it gets blurred as you sort of expand, read and publish in oa, but maybe update us on renewal rates and pricing trends related to the core journal subscription business? any sense for what percentage of business is booked today and how we're looking for '22?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
sure. absolutely. you always have a good question, dan. thanks a lot.
so basically, as we look out through the year, our proportion of business in each of our segments has continued the pathway that they've been on. so oa is now in q1 up to 21% of our revenue in research. it was 13% last year. and i think that's a significant shift and a shift in the right direction.
our subs revenue has moderated from 62% last year down to 55% this year. and so you're seeing a continued shift. renewal rates remain strong. it is early in the year.
so we haven't really gotten into the renewal season yet. we'll get into that next quarter. but we continue -- we expect to continue to see a continued significant growth in oa and a slow moderation in the subscriptions business. i will note that our subscription business continues to be very strong and any moderation has been minor.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
understood. very helpful. and certainly --
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, dan, this is john.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
yup, go ahead, john.
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this is john. i just wanted to add, since you asked about pricing as well. i just wanted to add, as you know, traditionally, we've had relatively moderate price increases from year to year, and we took a pause on that in the last year given the impacts of covid and some of the budget challenges that our university customers were facing. so we took that pause.
but as we now make our way into the next season, we're expecting to resume the nominal increases that we've seen historically for those customers to our traditional subscription customers.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. and it certainly sounds like it, but how is hindawi performing relative to your expectations? and any concrete examples of that, how that's opening up growth opportunities faster for you?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. so look, hindawi is doing very, very well, growing strong double digits. we expect that to continue through the year. we just had our largest month of submissions and publishing ever at hindawi.
and i think in what is -- can only be described as a validation of our strategy and the reason for buying it, a material portion of hindawi's growth -- not most of it, still just a small part of it, but a material part of it is driven by the cascade of articles that we've been talking about for so long by that cascade of articles from the total wiley submission pool throughout the wiley empire, but also materially into hindawi. so all systems go. the integration has gone well, minimal disruption of any kind, and we're really honestly very pleased with how things are going. and hindawi is really leading the way in terms of growth.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. maybe one more and i'll jump back in queue. but thanks for the increased transparency into your cash flow with the new adjusted eps calculation. you started to buy back a few shares this quarter once again.
the stock kind of 13 times that this year's adjusted eps guide and leverage at two times, are you considering being more aggressive on that part of your capital allocation budget going forward? thanks for the color.
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
dan, i would say that we'll be up in terms of our share repurchases over prior year. as you'll recall, for the first half of last year, we stayed out of the market just conserving cash and observing the uncertain times that we're in, in hindawi and then we resumed purchases in the second half of the year. we're on a pace that we're comfortable with now, and we'll continue to buy throughout the year, we'll be opportunistic when the chances arise. but we're -- i would say we're at about the pace that we expect to be over the course of the year.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. all right. i'll jump back with any follow-ups. thank you.
operator
and our next question is coming from greg pendy of sidoti. please go ahead.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just two. one, can you just help us out, you maintain the free cash flow guidance.
it looks like it was pretty good. in this quarter, some of that was probably capex-related that has to catch up throughout the year. but are there any other puts and takes that kind of -- after a good quarter of free cash flow that kind of has you maintaining it that we should be aware of?
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
greg, i would say it's early on in the year. the quarter was favorable, partly driven by strong cash earnings, which we anticipated and significantly driven by working capital timing. so some of that may unwind later in the year. so we're comfortable for sure with the guidance level that we're at.
and to the extent that we need to adapt as we make our way through the year, we will. but i would say there's not a lot of evidence in the first quarter that we should change the position we've taken on the year.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and then just moving on, just education services. it seems like it might be getting a little bit more competitive there.
can you kind of elaborate? and maybe are you seeing possibly -- i know you sell services, maybe single services as well. is that becoming more favorable? can you just give us a little bit of color on what's going on as maybe enrollments start to normalize?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. well, i think the important thing is that the long-term trend that we've been talking about is continuing. the current period we're in is more of -- the performance in the current period is more a reflection of what happened last year than what's happening going forward. we do believe that -- and we're seeing tremendous interest from our clients, both for traditional rev share models and for fee-for-service models.
in fact, as the financial environment has gotten challenged, the rev share model continues to add a lot of legs because essentially, we're using our financial strength to help these schools achieve the goals that they want to achieve. so again, the longer term, we believe that the enrollment trends toward online and hybrid education will continue. we think there's enormous and global opportunity that is very, very -- has a lot of green space. it's not particularly highly penetrated right now.
you'll see evidence in this in our significant growth now in ed services coming out of australia, where we've opened up a partnership with a major university called la trobe, 36,000 students in order to deliver their programs online into new audiences. what we are seeing overall is a continued evolution of the space as the needs of the education market change. what we see is that demand for our traditional programs remains and there's increasing demand for nontraditional offerings that we're providing throughout our offering as well. so i wouldn't say -- i would say what's happening now is simply a natural result of a very high demand last year as everyone had to go online.
and what we're seeing now is students are -- some of them are migrating to on ground a little bit. some of them are returning to their careers and some of them are just taking a pause. but nonetheless, demand remains very strong.
greg pendy -- sidoti & company -- analyst
that's very helpful. i'll jump back in. thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] and to continue now, our next question is back from mr. daniel moore of cjs securities. go ahead, sir.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
yes. thanks again. you gave great detail around professional corporate learning and great to see the rebound. still not quite back to pre-covid levels.
just talk about the momentum you're seeing there and what type of growth is reasonable to expect from this, if this is a new base or run rate? or if we're still sort of in recovery mode right now?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
great question. well, we're -- it's a very interesting time because what we saw last year, which we were very pleased with, is as the professional and corporate learning businesses were adapting to covid, we saw a -- i wouldn't call a covid-related bounce, we certainly saw covid-related bounce in our digital offerings, but what we saw is a change in the behavior of our corporate clients toward things that are actually incredibly aligned with our strategy. so one of them, as we talked about last year, is this migration of corporate training to being digital versus in person. and even at this point with a lot of workplaces back, we're still above 70% proportion of digital trainings, which is pretty incredible and really positive as we've discussed, that opens up a lot of opportunities for us.
and so we're seeing that. and we're also seeing corporations, again, as we discussed, as i talked about in my prepared remarks, we're seeing corporations waging war for talent. and when they're waging war for talent, they got to do a bunch of things in order to find that talent. in the case of our offerings, we're actually helping build that talent.
so we really like what we see there. the-- what we've seen in the results in that segment is basically some hangover with regard to things like test prep, which are struggling to get back to normal. but overall, we think the performance in that segment is on the right track and getting back to, i should say, supportive of our longer-term strategies, and we're seeing growth in all the spaces we expect to see growth and need to see growth to empower our strategy or to realize the fruits of our strategy.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and if we see digital delivery remaining, the lion's share, is there a meaningful differential in terms of profitability versus those kind of legacy or historic in-person delivery models?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll ask john to comment on that in a second. but as we go forward, what happens is the digital delivery, which will allow us to tap into significantly greater audiences, because obviously, we can get to more places where there may be a training one day or two days, if it's in person, that same training is available to people 365 days a year when it's digital. and similarly, if we can only access -- if we're training new talent for companies, and we can only access them in person, there are certain physical limitations but the digital delivery allows us to access significantly larger audiences.
john, do you want to comment on profitability?
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would just add, dan, what this is really doing is it's helping to support the recovery of the revenue base and then grow it for the longer term. the fundamental product line is still, at the end of day, largely a digital product. and so it's essentially building more demand for our current product line, which is largely a digital product. i wouldn't expect it to materially change the margin performance of that business, but it certainly will help improve the volume of that business.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
makes sense. one last string i'd love to pull on, if i could. in the education services side, i'd love to drill down a little bit more into the profitability of each of the two businesses. in talent development, you're seeing really strong growth and obviously, reinvesting in that as you described.
what's the glide path toward a more normal -- whether it's double-digit, low teens sort of more normal margin achievements in that business over time?
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so dan, we usually don't get down too far deep into the performance of the individual product lines, but i will -- in this case, i'll say that the mthree business is definitely in a growth phase, right, and -- the talent development business, i should say. and in this early stage, it's essentially a breakeven basis on an ebitda level and growing. so it's dilutive to the segment overall relative to the margin rate inside of the opm business for scale. and so we're in a very deep growth phase.
it's an important part of our investment in that period -- this period and for the year. it's part of the downtick in profitability for the segment overall this year, but we fully expect that that's going to grow as we build that business globally.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and lastly, on the university services side, with reenrollment slowing somewhat, does it take a little bit longer to get back to those operating margins? or is this more of just a normalization as you described for this one-, two-, three-quarter period?
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'm expecting that we're going to get back to over the longer term and get back to the kind of rates that we've been talking about for long-term performance. so we said we expected to see ebitda margin in that business of 17% or greater, then we'll get there. this is -- i should though note, this is a year of investment for us in that business, as well as we are seeking to expand our capability to attract students at ever improving rates in terms of student acquisition costs and provide better services. so we will see lower margin in the opm business here.
we've been signaling that it's really driven by investment and some additional challenges that we've been seeing around marketing costs in the short term.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thanks for the color.
john kritzmacher -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, dan.

good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the wiley second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, wiley's vice president of investor relations, brian campbell.
please go ahead.
brian campbell -- vice president of investor relations
hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. a few reminders to start. the call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. you shouldn't rely on these statements as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our sec filings.
the company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. also, while we provide non-gaap measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying profitability and performance trends, these measures do not have standardized means prescribed by u.s. gaap, and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under gaap. unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-gaap metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency.
after the call, a copy of the presentation and playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. i'll now turn the call of to wiley's president and ceo, brian napack. 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, all. welcome to our q2 earnings call. wiley team has delivered another quarter of solid performance, underscoring wiley's leading position in the knowledge business and our strong performance in serving the ever-increasing demand for scientific research and for career connected education. as you know, wiley drives impacts in three areas: we enable scientific discovery, we power career connected education, and reshape workforces.
in a world hungry for innovation and opportunity, it's not surprising that we're finding strong growth in our research and education businesses. wiley reported good revenue growth of 9% this quarter, 5% of which was organic, driving a 7% increase in adjusted ebitda and a 6% increase in adjusted ebitda. revenue was up 9% in research, 3% in apl, and 15% in ed services. as a reminder, all variances exclude currency impact.
john will touch on our first half results but i will say upfront that we are very pleased with how the year is progressing and we continue to track well to our full year guidance for revenue, earnings, and cash flow. our growth strategies are largely on target and you can see that they are paying off. they remain well aligned with favorable and enduring market trends such as the shift toward open research, the focus on career connected education, and the drive of corporations to fill the widening talent gap. these trends are creating significant demand for our transformational open access research models for our career-focused learning programs and for the talent development services that we provide to corporations.
in the quarter, we continued to see a strong post-lockdown recovery in professional learning, which more than offset a decline in education publishing, which was driven by softness in u.s. fall enrollment and the easing of last year's covid-related tailwinds, along with the disposition of a wiley online, which is content portfolio. meanwhile accelerated growth in talent development more than offset the easing of last year's covid-related tailwinds in online education, where enrollment growth slowed to 3%. as announced in october, john kritzmacher will be retiring at the end of december.
for eight critical years, john has been an exceptional leader for wiley, helping to drive our strategic direction, expand our growth profile, and strengthen our financial position. he built an expanding finance organization and leaves us well positioned for a great future. on behalf of the board of directors and of all our colleagues worldwide, i want to thank john for his strong principled leadership. john, we all wish you the very best in all there is to come.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian. brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
also on the call today with us is christina van tassell, our new chief financial officer. christina joins us from dow jones, where she served as cfo and helped to grow leading digital information businesses like the wall street journal, barron's, marketwatch, and factiva. before that, she was cfo of xaxis, a wpp company. she brings to wiley over 30 years of broad financial leadership, strategic insight, and a proven ability to drive operational excellence.
i'm looking forward to partnering with her on our next phase of growth. welcome, christina.
christina van tassell -- incoming chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and hello, everyone. it's great to be here. i had long admired wiley for its remarkable legacy, its financial strength, and meaningful contributions to society. i believe our deep network of partnerships with the world's leading universities and corporations and our unique position as an advocate for researchers and learners will allow us to win in this dynamic global market, which continues to rapidly evolve.
i also want to take this opportunity to thank john for his example and for building a terrific finance organization. i look forward to working with the wiley team to further accelerate growth, to drive innovation, and to consistently deliver strong results and shareholder value. i also look forward to meeting all of you. thanks.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's just great to have you on the team, christina. so i want to start today by talking briefly about the large corporate opportunities that we are now tapping into across wiley. as you know, at its core, wiley is a knowledge and a learning company. and in a world where new information, new discoveries, and new capabilities are the engines that power innovation and growth, wiley is very well positioned, which you can see in our year-over-year growth of 17% for research corporate solutions, 15% for professional learning, and 67% for corporate talent development.
corporations need our research content, our platforms, and our databases to achieve their commercial objectives. wiley provides the cutting edge knowledge that companies need to develop new products, and our platforms and services help those companies to achieve their marketing goals. for example, we just kicked off an ambitious project with pharmaceutical giant eli lilly to build four educational resource hubs in critical disease areas. this helps them to educate and activate their healthcare community and increase their brand engagement.
through the wiley online library, our proprietary research content platform, we can provide direct access to over 15 million scientific medical and technical researchers. this results in 179 million extremely valuable impressions per month, so targeted media and advertising will be an increasingly attractive business for us as the wiley network of partners grows. wiley's expanding portfolio of partner solutions also includes digital career centers that help employers to fill their critical jobs with qualified candidates. for example, we just renewed an important partnership with our partner pfizer to manage its career center.
of course, any ceo will tell you that building a winning workforce with the right skills and capabilities is now both their biggest pain point and their biggest opportunity. for this reason, wiley is increasingly on the front lines with our corporate clients in the escalating war for talent. we've always played an important role in helping universities to supply career-ready talent in the labor market, and we continue to do so effectively in education publishing and in universities services. but today, the world's leading companies are increasingly turning to wiley to directly address their most urgent talent needs.
you can see this in the success that we're having with our professional learning and talent development solutions. here, wiley is playing an essential role in helping companies to attract trained, retain, upscale, and reskill their talent and teams. we're rapidly signing up new clients to create hard-to-find tech and digital business talent. we've secured six more major global corporations in this quarter and are seeing unprecedented growth in employee placement.
moreover, the opportunity to expand client relationships with additional skills-based training continues to expand. during the quarter, we expanded our relationship with one of our largest fortune 100 clients and we will now be reskilling their existing employees with critical digital skills. this will help them retain valued experienced colleagues and prepare them to contribute anew. the return on investment of these reskilling activities is very high for our partners, and of course, for wiley.
every day, we are talking to our multinational clients about similar value-added services. in another example of how the corporate opportunity is influencing all of wiley's activities, we are now delivering a customized self-serve platform to our clients that strategically connect their employees with career enhancing degree and certification programs while also managing the burdensome administration of tuition reimbursement. with that, let's move on to our segment performance. research again delivered strong revenue and profit growth with revenue up 9% or 4% on an organic basis and adjusted ebitda up 10% for a q2 ebitda margin of 37%.
our performance was driven by double-digit growth in open research publishing, corporate solutions, and research platforms. research article output rose 8% year over year driven by the hindawi acquisition. organically, article output was actually lower by comparison to last year's covid-driven surge when lockdowns caused an unprecedented 22% increase in output as millions of researchers exited the lab and focused on documenting their research. that said, the organic trend line continues to be very positive with a two-year average output growth of around 9% per year, very strong indeed.
demand to publish remains robust due first to the ever-increasing global investment in science and second due to the enduring draw of our wiley journal brands. in the quarter, we announced a multi-year transformational agreement with the council of australian university librarians. this is the largest read and publish agreement to-date in that region. the agreement provides subscription access to all of wiley's journals and it grants researchers at 52 participating institutions the ability to publish accepted articles by open access in wiley's journals.in early november, we announced a multi-year transformational agreement with the virginia library consortium involving over 70 libraries.
it was our 15th transformational agreement globally and seventh announced in 2021. we see a very strong pipeline ahead. as a reminder, these strategic agreements are great for our large customers and great for us. they drive significant incremental publishing volume and move us closer to a p times q ecosystem, where revenue is a direct function of the quantity of articles published in the price we charge.
and on the quantity side, the outlook looks very good for publishing output in the years to come. and on the pricing side, wiley continues to enjoy very solid pricing power due to the draw of our high quality journal portfolio. the result of this is a very healthy dynamic and continued revenue gains. as you know, wiley partners with over 900 of the world's leading academic societies and research publishers helping them all to succeed in an increasingly complex information ecosystem.
specifically our partners need support in crossing the chasm to an open access future, and wiley helps them adapt to the complexity while generating new revenue streams for them by leveraging our industry leading platforms and services. this area is what we refer to as partner solutions. we recently made two exciting new acquisitions to broaden our offering in this key growth area. the first j&j editorial provides world-class highly efficient production, copy editing, system support, and consulting support to 120 demanding societies and publishers.
the second, knowledge unlatched, helps our clients and partners address a critical pain point: the processing at scale of per article open access transaction. this is one of the most complex challenges in the open transition. knowledge unlatched had solved this problem for its rapidly growing client base through innovative, per article payment services, workflow tools, and data analytics. without these key links in the commercial value chain, many of the world's societies and publishers would simply not be able to participate in the open future.
in summary, we have strong momentum in research and this is reflected in our current operating performance and the success of our strategic initiatives, which will deliver even greater opportunity for growth in the future. academic and professional learning rose 3% this quarter driven by 15 percent growth in professional learning. adjusted ebitda rose 18% for a q2 ebitda margin of 33%. this is up from a 29% margin in the prior year period.
as noted, after last year's covid-related setback, we are seeing continued strong recovery in professional learning as corporations and professionals focus intensely on building the capabilities that they need to succeed in a post-pandemic environment. this is evident in our strong year-over-year growth in professional publishing and in corporate training. professional publishing continues to benefit from timely publication of titles in areas like investing, de&i, and leadership. corporate training continues to deliver strong performance through virtual and in-person delivery with revenue growth of 24%.
education publishing revenue was down 5% this quarter, the result of softer u.s. enrollment, the easing of pandemic related tailwinds for content and courseware and the sale of our world languages portfolio. u.s. fall undergraduate enrollment, an important driver for us, was down 3% as universities continued to manage through the challenging enrollment environment.
printed course materials was down 15%, offsetting modest growth in digital content. in the second quarter, printed course material represented only 7.5% of wiley's revenue, down from nearly 9% in the year ago period. we continue to see positive trends ahead for digital content in courseware in this market. we'll see continued declines in print resulting in a full year revenue outlook for education publishing that is roughly in line with prior year.
in summary, the strong recovery in professional learning this quarter from robust demand for professional content and skill-based training more than offset a year-over-year decline in education publishing. our education services segment reported 15% growth for the quarter with university services up 3% and m3 talent development, up 67%. adjusted ebitda for the segment was approximately $10 million, down 35% due to higher student acquisition costs and university services and investment in talent development to accelerate the expansion of client relationships. our adjusted ebitda margin for the segment was 12%.
unity -- university services growth was also impacted by software fall enrollment in the u.s. with graduate enrollment up 2%, compared to 6% last year, and undergraduate enrollment down 3%. enrollment in our online programs is up 3%, compared to 14% enrollment growth in fiscal '21 when covid shut down campuses and forced the sudden shift of enrollment online. if you normalize it out over a two-year period, enrollment in our online programs is up 8% on average.
so a very solid trend line overall for online education for us. we recently added new york-based adelphi university, a top 200 school, as a new full service partner and we signed an important renewal with georgetown university, along with adding 14 new degree programs with existing partners. we're seeing good momentum in markets like australia and with innovative short course programs in subject areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and crypto finance. in talent development, as i've talked about earlier, we're rapidly signing new corporate clients, upselling existing clients, and expanding into new verticals.
in today's economy, all industries are in dire need of tech and digital skills, and this is reflected in the multinational clients we've signed this quarter, which come from multiple sectors, including financial services, food services, and facilities management. we also grew talent placements with our existing fortune 100 customers by nearly 130%. as noted, we're also making very good progress in upselling additional reskilling services to our existing clients. momentum is clearly accelerating.
in summary, we continue to see strong growth in ed services as we expand our partnerships with leading universities and corporations to attract, to educate, to place, to retain, to upscale, and to reskill talent needed to succeed in the global digital economy. with that, i'll pass the call over to john to take you through our outlook and our financial position.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. as brian noted, the wiley team continues to execute on our growth strategies and drive operational improvements throughout the business. i'd like to briefly recap our first half performance, which clearly demonstrates that we are tracking well to our full year outlook. revenue was up 9% to $1.02 billion, or 6% organically, with research up 10%, apl up 5%, and ed services up 14%.
adjusted ebitda was up 9% to $222 million driven by first half profit contributions from research and apl, offsetting investment in ed services growth initiatives. our six-month adjusted ebitda margin was 22%, right in line with prior year and adjusted eps rose 10% to $2.14. as a reminder, our adjusted eps metric now excludes the non-cash memorization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions. i would also again note that all variances on this slide are shown at constant currency.
foreign exchange movement favorably contributed to our first half results by $19 million in revenue, $2 million in adjusted ebitda, and $0.03 in adjusted eps. given our first half performance in leading indicators, we are reaffirming our fiscal '22 guidance, which includes revenue growth of mid to high single digits to a range of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion. adjusted ebitda is expected to range between $415 million $435 million with profit gains on higher revenue tempered by investments to accelerate growth. adjusted eps is anticipated to range between $4 and $4.25.
and free cash flow is expected to range between $200 million and $220 million. as a reminder, while cash earnings are again expected to be strong in fiscal '22, we see certain headwinds compared to fiscal '21, including higher capex, higher net cash taxes due to the cares act-related tax refund received in fiscal '21 and higher annual incentive compensation payments related to fiscal '21 outperformance, which were issued in q1 of this year. one further note on these projections, i should point out that our year-to-date and projected fx rates are in line with the rates prevailing when we issued our guidance in june. turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, our net debt to ebitda ratio was 2.1 at the end of october, compared to 1.9 at the same time last year.
at quarter end, we had $101 million of cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit capacity of more than $435 million. free cash flow in the first half was in line with prior year driven by higher cash earnings, offset by higher annual incentive compensations for our fiscal year '21 performance. capex was $51 million, up $3 million over prior year, and we invested $14 million in acquisitions. we will continue to be active on the m&a front as we seek to add capabilities to our core strategic areas of focus in research and career connected education.
finally, $56 million was allocated to dividends and share repurchases, up from $38 million in the prior year period due to our covid-related pause and share repurchases last year. as a reminder, we raised our dividend payout in june for the 28th consecutive year and our current yield is roughly 2.5%. so far this year, we've repurchased 313,000 shares at an average cost per share of $55.51 for a total spend of $17.4 million. we have $200 million remaining in the current share repurchase authorization.
before i pass the call back to brian, i just want to thank all our wiley's stakeholders, including our investors, colleagues, and coverage analysts for your engagement and support over the years. i wish you and your families well. wiley is a great company with very capable leadership and a bright future ahead.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thanks very much, john. at our core, in everything we do, wiley is driving positive impact whether it's delivering more cutting-edge knowledge to the world faster and more openly or unlocking career potential for millions of learners and workers. as i've said before, the more researchers and learners that we help, the greater the positive societal impact. and with wiley, as is evident in our recent performance, positive impact is very good for business.
our colleagues are highly motivated by our ability to drive impact both within our walls and out in the world through our products and services. we are widely recognized for our impact and have been deemed a very low risk company from an esg perspective. in fact, we are rated in the fourth percentile globally for esg risk by sustainalitics and morningstar company. we're very proud of this rating but we also know that there is always more room for improvement.
improving the price value equation in education is one of our long-standing objectives. and as an education service provider, transparency about education outcomes is critical. to this end, we recently published a transparency report that highlights the affordability, accessibility, and outcome of our partner degree programs. the data is clear and it shows that graduation and retention rate at our partner institutions are materially higher than a comparable not-for-profit online schools.
the data also shows that the cost to earning a degree at our partner programs is lower. for instance, on average, an online mba costs $25,000 in one of our programs, which is $6,000 less than the market average. our nurse practitioner m.s. is $4,000 less than average.
across wiley, we're always looking for ways to lower the cost of education while improving career outcomes. today, wiley is a digital company with 83% of our revenue generated by digital and tech-enabled products and services. that said, we still have many opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint, including the impact of our printed products, which represents 17% of our revenue. we're working hard on this.
this year alone, we actively reduced our printed journals by one 1.1 million units to our go-green program, saving 8,000 trees, reducing shipping poly bags by another 1.1 million units, and eliminating the significant footprint of shipping. going forward, we'll plant a tree for every print copy wiley actively starts printing as a symbol of our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint. in everything we do, the colleagues of wiley are working to drive positive impact. let me quickly summarize the key takeaways before i open it up for questions.
wiley has delivered strong first half performance with revenue and earnings growth driven by solid performance across segments. the long-term favorable trends that have been defining our markets continue to roll forward, including the shift to open research, the increasing focus on digital career connected education, and the ever-growing need of corporations to fill the widening talent gap. wiley's business today and its growth strategies are tightly aligned with these trends, and you can see this in our current performance and full year outlook. we continue to drive we have real world impact and advance our esg and sustainability initiatives inside wiley and out in the world through our research and education products and services.
given our solid first half performance and positive indicators, we're reaffirming our full year outlook and we're well on our way to surpassing $2 billion in revenue for the first time in our long and illustrious history. on behalf of all wiley colleagues worldwide, i want to again thank john for his partnership and his remarkable contribution to wiley over the years. one more note since i know that the great resignation is on the top of everyone's mind. there is no doubt that the last two years have caused many to reevaluate their career pathways but i will say that i feel very good about wiley's terrific team.
our engagement levels are very high by any standards and our colleague retention is well above mentioned benchmarks. we're clearly able to attract amazing talent to join our journey. one reason for all of this is our attention to ensuring a people-centered culture, which includes a real commitment to personal growth and career development, and at a deeper level, is also due to the passion that all of us at wiley have firm mission and the real benefit and the real belief in the impact that each of us can have on the world every day. my personal goal is to make sure wiley remains the place to be in research and education.
especially at this time of year, i'm grateful for our wonderful wiley colleagues and their enduring dedication to each other. if the last two years have proven anything, it is that our commitment to take care of each other and the global community is more important now than ever and our research and education are at the very foundation of a long peaceful and prosperous future. as 2021 comes to a close, i want to wish everybody in the wider community and all of you a very joyful holiday season and a happy and healthy 2022. i'll now open the floor to any comments and questions.

[operator instructions] your first question is from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning and thanks for taking my questions. i'll start quickly. john, just -- first off, thank you for your candor and transparency over the last eight years.
it's been great working with you and certainly look forward to working with christina. i will start with the research. the -- obviously, oracle submissions benefited to a significant degree from the pandemic and we're seeing that tough comp now. when do you expect to sort of get through those comps and maybe get back to a more normalized mid-single digit growth trajectory in terms of research article output?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's obviously a very important question, dan. we feel very good about the long-term trends in the business. we've always felt good about them. they're working their way in all of our businesses, and i think all ceos are seeing this this year.
last year was a particularly unusual year. this year is equally unusual if often in the reverse direction. it's difficult to sort through all the tea leaves but we're seeing trends in all of our data that tell us that we're reverting to back to norms. we feel very good about a 9% two-year average, as we highlighted.
and that underscores what we've been saying for a long time about the long-term investment in research leading to long-term output. also it's important to know that our oa businesses are growing very significantly, more than 80% year on year. and that's critical for the financial dynamic as we go forward. so you're going to see this stuff sort itself out over the balance of this year.
if not, in the long run, we're reverting to the norm -- if not more than the norm has increased investment occurs and as we take an increasing share, which we have been doing for the last four or five years.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. shift gears to academic and professional, start with ed publishing. do you expect that we are back on a sort of moderate decline trajectory in terms of overall revenue or with this quarter? is it more of a one, two, three quarter phenomenon, given just enrollment rates and what we saw across the board at most universities this fall?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, again, it's the same comment i can make for any of our businesses which again any ceo is going to make these days. last year was very unusual. this year was unusual in academic and professional, particularly in ed pub, which is what i think you're focusing on.
what we're seeing is that, yes, the long-term trends from print and digital continue. the business is now 60% digital, so we feel really good about that. we feel really good about the trajectory. we feel really good about the fact that universities continue after all of the transition to use gold standard published products like ours to -- in their classrooms and in their online settings.
so we feel very good about all that. and so in the long run, i don't see any reversion. i see a continuation of that and a continuation of these things washing out over a set of quarters, not a set of years. but again i feel very good about the business and it continues to be an extremely good and profitable business for us and we'll see as we -- how we do going forward.
but i think it's -- the story hasn't changed, and i think that's underlying your question. has the story changed? no. story is the same.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. in professional learning, obviously, a really nice bounceback here and that business, frankly, held up better than maybe some would have thought through the pandemic. but where are we relative to pre-pandemic levels for those underlying businesses in professional learning? and are the variants a risk to the recovery or do you think we've sort of learned to work hybrid or remote enough that we just kind of continue to trudge along and continue to recover from here?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, we're still below the levels that we were before the pandemic because the in-person training certainly hasn't returned at the levels because we're all -- we're not back in the office and people are behaving differently. so we're currently trending about 10% or 15% below where we were pre-covid but there are some really good developments in that business. and the developments are, as we've talked about in prior quarters, during this pandemic we actually turned a business that was primarily about in-person training into one that is now primarily about -- or i should say balanced between online and in-person training. so that allows us to have digital relationships not just with our company and our managers but with the people that go through the training, allowing us to, a, do a better job because training isn't just episodic but, b, have a long meaning -- i do training and then maybe two years from now, i do another training.
but we get to have that relationship on an ongoing basis and we get to adjust because of the longer term relationship have a longer lifetime value. so we're still below but we're trending back very nicely. we expect we fully recovered by the end of this fiscal year, and that full recovery would be at a -- with a business that in our opinion is way healthier with a lot more growth potential than we had going into the pandemic. look, in short, dan, what happened is covid forced the digital transition, where there should have been one but people -- before because it's better just as we see across many of our businesses but -- so it forced that transition and now when we catch up to the demand as we get back to a more normalized situation, we will have both a healthy in-person and a healthy online business so we feel -- again we feel good about.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. maybe shift gears while i'm on a roll here. but ed services, can you maybe give a little more delineation in terms of profitability between opm and talent development? just trying to understand where we are in the trajectory for each given the upfront investments. i think you mentioned it was more on the opm side.
i don't know if you want to give specific numbers but any color there would be helpful.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, we're not breaking out the individual margins of those divisions but as we have said in the past, we are -- these are growth businesses and we're investing in them. we're running in three -- at around the break even, trying to get it to grow and take advantage of that huge opportunity that i obviously spoke a lot about today as we are across many of our businesses, that corporate opportunity. and in the ed services side, we are certainly investing.
we're investing in marketing to help our partners grow. we're investing in new partners and we do expect in the mid -- in the long term, as we've said many times, that that 15% margin, completely achievable and we continue to run that business very profitably, which is a big accomplishment in this segment. so no change there, running both of the businesses as growth businesses and we're investing significantly in both of them and in the segment overall. so yeah, i think we're -- john, would you add anything to my comments there?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
no. brian, i think you described it well. we are roughly -- you mentioned profit margins, so just to be clear we're talking about adjusted ebitda margin on these businesses. again, we're running the talent development business for growth and not trying to drive improvements in profitability there.
it sits close to neutral on an adjusted ebitda basis but we're running for growth there, and you could see that in this quarter's results with 67% revenue growth. and again on the university services side, that business is geared up for long-term adjusted ebitda margins of 15% or higher and we're going to keep it there over time. that's the plan.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. just in terms of the performance year to date, both top and bottom line, it's been ahead of our projections. just curious if you see the higher end of the guidance as being maybe being more likely or is it -- would you describe it as basically in line with your internal forecast to date?
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
yeah, and i would describe the results year to date as roughly in line to either our expectations year to date. clearly, we're trending a bit ahead or you would think that we're trending toward the higher end of the range. hence, your question. but i would say that we do expect to see a bit of the investment that we called out when we issued our guidance to be in the back half of the year versus the front as we ramp up on some of our initiatives.
so i wouldn't start to be precise about where we land on those guidance ranges. i would point out to you got some investment on the back end and we feel very confident about where we're trending at this point in the year.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
excellent. last one, the -- you bought back 10 million of shares in the quarter. clearly continued to ramp up cash return to shareholders. is at a reasonable run rate going forward? obviously, you've got a super strong balance sheet and cash generation.
is there anything precluding you from maybe being even more aggressive here? thanks for the color and everything.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
dan, i would say that you should expect us to roughly stay the course now. we don't have any particular changes that are planned. we continue to drive a balance between investing in the business both organically and with acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. and so we're going to likely stay the course in the near term, continuing to maintain that balance as we seek longer term capital allocation, investing for growth.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very good. thank you both. thank you for all the color.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, dan.
john kritzmacher -- chief financial officer
thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is rob, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the wiley's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] wiley's vice president of investor relations, brian campbell.
you may begin your conference.
brian campbell -- vice president, investor relations
hello, everyone. a few reminders to start. the call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. you shouldn't rely on these statements as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our sec filings.
the company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. also, wiley provides non-gaap measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends. these measures do not have standardized meanings described by u.s. gaap and therefore, cannot be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under gaap.
unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-gaap metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency. after the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. i'll now turn the call over to wiley's president and ceo, brian napack. 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our q3 earnings call. our exceptional team delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth, and we continue to track to our full year guidance for revenue, earnings, and cash flow. christina will talk more about the outlook later in our presentation. by the way, this is our first official wiley earnings call together, and it's great to have christina as a partner.
she's already having incredible impact on the company. i'll start today's call by saying we have, of course, been closely watching the devastating events in ukraine. wiley strongly condemns russia's invasion of ukraine, and we call for a ceasefire an immediate return to piece. further, we call for constructive engagement and dialogue to resolve this conflict and achieve lasting piece that serves all people.
as a global company with significant operations across europe, we have many colleagues, customers, partners, and loved ones directly or indirectly affected by this conflict. our hearts are with them and all the people of ukraine. we pledge to support humanitarian efforts in ukraine and across europe. on a happier note, this year marks wiley's 215th anniversary.
that's 215 years of unlocking human potential by advancing research and education, which we have proudly done through good times and bad, through the industrial revolution, the digital revolution, globalization, and numerous periods of disruption, including recently two global pandemics. we're immensely proud to be an important part of the ongoing american journey, and we'll be celebrating this milestone throughout the year. at wiley's core, we're in the knowledge business, the creation, the dissemination, and the application of new information and new knowledge. we do our work through scientific research and career-connected education.
and in a world where new information is being created faster than ever, where new discoveries, insights, and innovations are the essential lifeblood of every career and every industry knowledge is a pretty good business to be in. as a leader in the knowledge industry, wiley does three things: we enabled discovery through scientific research, we power career-connected education for learners and professionals and we shape workforces for employers. year in and year out, the world spends more on what wiley does, and with good reason, research, and education power the global knowledge economy. wiley is tightly focused on two strategies that target the seismic trends driving the knowledge economy.
first, we are leading the industry's transition to open research with our research publishing and research solutions. our impact goal here is for more cutting-edge research to be available to more people faster so it can drive more innovation and advancement. wiley's second strategy is to bridge the widening talent gap with career-connected education products and education services. our impact goal here is to ensure that the massive global investment in education delivers a meaningful roi for society in the form of career advancement and corporate strategic success.
simply stated, from our customers' point of view, wiley helps the world's researchers and learners to succeed in their chosen fields, and we help universities and corporations to achieve their goals through research and education, so that they can win in the increasingly competitive global knowledge economy. wiley achieved this impact to our portfolio of branded content platforms and services, with 82% of our revenue tech-enabled. we offer everything to the world through our market-responsive business models. we deliver it all through an unmatched network of university and corporate partners, and we succeed as a business through sharp execution.
wiley's consistent strategies in open research and career-connected education are paying off with solid revenue and ebitda growth over the three-year period through the covid lockdowns and year-to-date. despite the significant transitions in our sector in a very unusual two-year period, we're expecting to generate over $400 million in ebitda and over $200 million in cash flow this fiscal year while surpassing the $2 billion mark in revenue for the first time ever. all this shows that after 215 years, wiley is foundationally strong and performing well. and we believe that our hard work and investment in innovation is setting us up for continued profitable success in the long term.
as you know, wiley drives positive real-world impact in everything we do, whether it's by delivering more research discoveries to the world or by unlocking the career potential of millions of learners and workers worldwide. as i've said before, the more researchers and learners that we help, the greater the societal impact. and as evidenced in our performance, positive impact is good for business. we are committed to continuous progress in esg.
for the second straight year, wiley has been officially certified as carbon neutral. more significantly, we are actively working to lock in on our science-based targets which will provide us with a clear route to sustainability by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. we continue to drive improvement in our esg ratings, the latest coming from s&p corporate sustainability assessment. we saw our esg score triple.
it is now well above average for our industry. this comes as sustainalytics ranked wiley in the top fourth percentile for low esg risk among 14,000 companies. in fact, we were named as one of the top-rated esg companies for 2022 by sustainalytics with regional distinction. we still have a long way to go, but we're committed to meaningful progress.
ok. so let's talk about third quarter results. as a reminder, all variances exclude currency impact. our team delivered overall revenue growth of 7% or 4% organic growth.
adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps were down 5% and 9%, mainly due to planned investments and higher technology costs in research and education services. revenue was up 10% in research and 18% in ed services, while down 1% in apl. i'll review the specifics of our q3 segment performance in the next few slides and then pass it to christina to review our results through nine months. but let me start by commenting briefly on current geopolitical and economic conditions.
with regard to ukraine, both russia and ukraine are small markets for us. so we do not expect to see any material revenue impact. wiley does have a technology development center in russia, one of several around the world, and we have solid contingency plans in place for this location as in all locations to ensure business continuity. we're confident in those plans but continue to monitor this very uncertain situation, and we will adapt as circumstances change.
as you would expect, this terrible situation is weighing on all our colleagues and is getting a lot of management attention right now. from an economic point of view, there's a renewed focus on inflation and the supply chain dynamics that have been prevalent through the pandemic. christina is following these topics very closely. we do not foresee any material impact from these factors to affect our fiscal '22 results, and we're watching for inflationary pressure on wages, print publishing, and other costs as we look to next year.
while supply chain management has presented some challenges for us, none have been material and our largely digital nature means that any issues are limited. as a reminder, physical products make up only about 18% of our revenue. further, our operations and production teams have done an outstanding job of minimizing any disruption through the pandemic. as you would expect, another issue we are watching closely right now is the great resignation.
like all companies, wiley has seen a modest elevation in our turnover recently, but nothing that raises any major issues. at the same time, we're winning great new talent with critical skill sets, and we continue to see very high engagement overall. we remain highly attuned to how our colleagues are doing, both personally and professionally, particularly after a very trying two-year period. significantly, they consistently report being highly motivated by our purpose and our important work.
as i said at the beginning of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, wiley has successfully navigated periods of uncertainty for 200 years and will continue to do so. from a segment performance perspective, research continues to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, with revenue up 10% or 5% on an organic basis, and adjusted ebitda up 4% for a q3 ebitda margin of 33%. our performance continues to be driven by solid growth in oa, publishing, corporate solutions, and research platforms. to refresh, there are two complementary parts of this business.
research publishing, which is migrating to oa and research solutions in which we deliver best-in-breed infrastructure and publishing services to help other players in the ecosystem, such as publishers, societies, associations, and corporations to thrive in the increasingly complex knowledge ecosystem. on the publishing side, wiley has been unlocking the ever-increasing demand for peer-reviewed research by moving our journal portfolio toward open access. in 2019, as you may recall, we saw what the market wanted in oa and we jumped in the driver's seat. ever since we've delivered above-market growth in the new pxq economy, where revenue is a direct function of the number of articles published and the price we charge.
the future looks very good for both volume and pricing based upon the long-term underlying market growth and our ability to win based on the enduring value of our journal brands. our broad collection of high-quality brands provides both the flywheel to drive demand and the moat to defend the wiley system. during the quarter, momentum continued to accelerate for our transformational read and publish models with major signings in the u.s. these included the california library consortium, the carolina consortium, the big ten alliance, and the department of energy as well as consortia in denmark, israel, japan, the republic of korea, and slovenia.
these multi-year agreements provide access to all of wiley's journals for an annual fee while granting researchers at these institutions the ability to publish with wiley. to date, we've signed 25 major transformational agreements worldwide, and we expect this momentum to continue. these agreements will continue to replace our legacy read-only deals. it is important to note from a reporting perspective that the hybrid nature of these agreements is increasingly blurring the line between business models and revenue lines.
and for this reason, we will no longer separate out open access revenue growth rates or oa share of revenue. our research article output is up 9% year to date, including the addition of hindawi, but down on an organic basis from last year's unprecedented covid surge which saw a 16% increase in output as millions of researchers focused on documenting their research. the overall trend line, however, continues to be positive with two-year average output growth of 6% per year. oa article output is up 25% year to date on an organic basis.
on the research solutions front, wiley is enabling the complex oa transition for the rest of the research ecosystem. we're helping societies and publishers by delivering critical platforms and services that enable content delivery, production, transaction processing, and audience monetization. the transition to oa is highly complex, it's costly and fraught with risk. wiley's scale capabilities ensure that our partners survive and thrive.
we recently made three small but strategic acquisitions to round out our end-to-end solutions in this area. they include j&j editorial, knowledge unlatched, and e-journal press. together, they will allow us to deliver a full range of capabilities to our partners and clients, including copy editing and payment services as well as journal workflow technologies. strong momentum continues for our corporate solutions lines with revenue up 11% in the quarter, 19% year to date.
wiley's value proposition here continues to expand. our platform enables corporations to reach 15 million researchers and leverage 179 million monthly impressions. our knowledge hubs allow consumer product companies like procter & gamble to engage and activate our valuable audiences, and our career centers help pharmaceutical companies like pfizer to fill their critical skill and talent gaps. in summary, we continue to see strong momentum across research, and this is reflected in our current operating performance and in the success of our strategic initiatives, which are delivering an even greater opportunity for wiley going forward.
apl revenue declined 1% this quarter, with education publishing down 2% and professional learning flat. adjusted ebitda rose 4% due to cost savings initiatives for a q3 ebitda margin of 30%. this is up from 29% in the prior-year period. overall, while apl revenue declined modestly this quarter, year-to-date revenue growth of 3% is tracking to our full year outlook.
we continue to drive margin improvement overall, and we feel very good about the consistent demand and long-term prospects for digital career-connected education for both students and for professionals. within this segment, education publishing performance was driven by lower year-on-year enrollment in the u.s. and unfavorable comparisons to last year's unusual covid bump. for the quarter, we saw continued growth in digital content, in zybooks, and in alta courseware offset by declines in printed course material and test prep products.
let me say a few words about the current unusual phase in the university content market. in 2020, in the first half of 2021, a covid drove record numbers of students into digital programs and settings where our digital content and courseware were simply essential. more recently, there has been a natural return to earth of digital enrollment numbers, made worse by a very strong economy. postsecondary education has always been countercyclical, and this year, some students have predictably chosen to defer school to pursue career opportunities.
consequently, undergraduate numbers are down over 6% since the fall of 2019. that's 1 million less students in the u.s. system. all this naturally affects our ed pub revenue, which is down 2% year-to-date, modestly off what we expected.
as you will see in a moment, we are seeing similar enrollment-driven effects in our university services business. that said, we remain quite confident in the long-term global trends in postsecondary education, along with the opportunities for winning content and courseware to return to growth as we emerge from this unusual period. in our professional learning lines of business, revenue was flat year over year due to the easing of the pandemic-related tailwinds that we saw last year for professional books, including our dummies products. on the positive side, the strong recovery incorporates soft skills training programs continued for both virtual and in-person delivery with growth up 18% in the quarter and 28% year to date.
on the education services side, we saw revenue growth of 18% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in corporate services. here, talent development revenue rose 112% as demand continued to accelerate for our tech talent development programs. this offset a 3% decline for university services, mainly due to this year's unusual cyclical u.s. university enrollment declines.
as expected, growth investments resulted in an adjusted ebitda decline of 14%. for the quarter, our adjusted ebitda margin was 13%. on the corporate side, we're rapidly signing new clients, upselling existing clients, and expanding into new verticals. the five multinational clients we signed this quarter include top financial services firms and a leading global technology company.
and the pipeline remains very strong. we also grew tech placements 122% with our existing client base of fortune 100 customers. we continue to make very good progress in our strategy to upsell additional tech training services to our expanding network of corporate clients. for example, one of our key global clients has recently agreed to an upskill tech program involving hundreds of employees and other clients are exploring the same.
on the university side, online enrollment in our programs has slowed compared to last year's unprecedented covid surge, up 3% year to date, but down modestly for the quarter. for context, if you look at it over a two-year period, our online enrollment cagr is around 7%. so what's happening in online degrees? first, as i said above, we're coming down from the unusual covid bump that drove students to flow into online programs. second, as things began to return to normal in the second half of 2021, the delta and omicron variant significantly disrupted both student demand and school admission processes.
the third, as i noted, potential students are now faced with a very strong economy that is luring them away from school and into work. again, though, we remain confident in the underlying trends in online post-secondary education despite the near-term challenges presented by these unique market conditions. wiley's high-impact services continue to be in demand, and this quarter, we signed a large top 25 institutions, renewed two multi-year partnerships, and added 22 new degree programs, and we're seeing continued interest from potential new partners. we're also seeing very good momentum in australia, one of our newer markets, where our work with la trobe university is now delivering over a dozen degree programs, along with innovative certifications and short course programs in areas like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
these shorter career-connected programs are great examples of the education that today's career-focused students want right now worldwide. the single biggest challenge facing universities is student acquisition. as they fight for survival in an increasingly competitive market, schools must attract and enroll students, which is increasingly costly and very complex. wiley's impressive capability in this area is a key source of differentiation and it includes digital marketing and end-to-end student enrollment services.
this past quarter, we augmented wiley's core value proposition by adding xyz media to the wiley family, which we acquired for $45 million. xyz is a market leader in student marketing. they generate over 140,000 highly qualified student leads per year for universities. beyond this, they are quite profitable.
we know the xyz team very well because we've been a major client of theirs for years. this enhanced capability is already generating new students for our client programs, improving client success, accelerating new program launches, and enhancing new partner acquisition prospects. for its full year december 2021, xyz generated approximately $15 million in revenue and $3 million of ebitda. in summary, education service continues to grow, continues to accelerate incorporate services as we signed major new clients and delivered record placements.
in university services, we have new enrollment challenges to work through, but we remain confident in our long-term ability to drive both growth and profit while helping our partners to deliver career-connected online degrees and credentialing programs that the market is demanding. i'll now pass it over to christina to take you through our year-to-date results, full year outlook and our financial position.

thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. before i begin, i just want to say how proud i am to be part of wiley. after only a few months on the job, i am struck by the team's incredible strength and talent and the collective passion for our mission and mission that changes lives for the better. as brian noted, the team continues to deliver on our growth strategies, and we are driving solid year-to-date performance.
on an enterprise level, we are tracking to our overall full year outlook with revenue up 8% to $1.54 billion or 5% organically, including research growth of 10%, apl of 3%, and ed services of 16%. however, there is some variability to note, namely in education services, where rapid growth in corporate talent development is offsetting unforeseen slowdown in university services. adjusted ebitda is up 4% to $322 million. it is driven by year-to-date profit contributions from research and apl offset by investments in both growth and business optimization initiatives.
these initiatives, which were highlighted at the start of the year, including -- include open access growth to meet global demand and scaling research partner solutions. in career-connected education, we are investing to expand our corporate pipeline and existing relationships as well as scaling our digital courseware offerings. we continue to embed operational excellence across this organization, and this will be a sharp focus of mine going forward. getting back to our financial results.
adjusted eps through nine months is up 4% to $3.09. as a reminder, wiley's adjusted eps metric excludes the impact of certain noncash items directly related to acquisitions, particularly the amortization of acquired intangibles. as brian noted, we don't expect any material impact from inflation this year, and we're currently assessing what potential impact there could be for fiscal '23. consistent cash generation continues to be a foundational strength for wiley.
it enables us to execute on our strategic plans, pay for tuck-in acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. through nine months, cash flow from operations of $158 million is ahead of prior year by 2% or $3 million. free cash flow of $77 million is down from $80 million, where higher cash earnings offset by higher -- was offset by higher capex and annual compensation payments. with regard to our balance sheet, net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 1.9% at the end of january compared to 2.2% at the same time last year.
liquidity continues to be steady with $109 million of cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit capacity of more than $560 million. capex for nine months is $6 million higher than prior year, and we allocated $71 million to acquisitions in research and university services, which brian already highlighted. we will continue to be active in m&a as we seek our targeted acquisitions and capabilities that support our key growth areas. we continue to return capital to our shareholders with $83 million devoted to dividends and share repurchases through nine months.
this is up $65 million from the prior year. our current dividend yield is around 2.8%, and we repurchased 448,000 shares year to date at an average cost per share of $55.48. there is approximately $200 million remaining in current authorizations. now let's turn to our outlook.
given our year-to-date performance and leading indicators, we are reaffirming our fiscal '22 guidance ranges, which are: revenue growth of mid-to-high single digits to a range of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion; adjusted ebitda in the range of $415 million to $435 million with profit gains on higher revenue tempered by investments to drive profitable growth in research and education services. adjusted ebitda -- adjusted eps in a range of $4.00 to $4.25 and free cash flow in the range of $200 million and $220 million. higher cash earnings are expected to be partially offset by higher capex, higher net cash taxes, higher annual compensation payments for fiscal year '21 performance. note that revenue and adjusted eps are trending toward the lower end of guidance due to the aforementioned market conditions in university services and education publishing.
our year-to-date fx rates are in line with the rates prevailing when we issued our guidance back in june. this outlook assumes current fx rates prevail for the remainder of the year. i look forward to presenting our fiscal '23 guidance coming up in june this year. finally, we are working to enhance our investment profile.
this is another focus area for me. part of that is to ensure that we're easily located. therefore, we will be changing our ticker symbols from jwa and jwb to wly and wlyb, which more closely aligns to our global wiley brand. we will be issuing a press release in the coming week and the change is expected to go into effect on april 1st.
and recently, our ongoing efforts to raise the profile of the wiley brand reached a new milestone with the launch of our external brand campaign. this campaign, a first for wiley, will allow us to clearly tell the exciting wiley story while reaching new audiences and broadening our overall exposure. and with that, i'll pass it back to brian with my sincere thanks for a great first quarter together.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you very much, christina. i'll just summarize with the key takeaways for the quarter before opening it up to questions. wiley's third quarter results are consistent with our expectations and reflect the consistent execution of our well-established strategies. good momentum in the research publishing and solutions end, notably incorporate products and services across wiley.
this momentum offset some countercyclical challenges in academic content and university services. to date, we are managing well through some very unusual geopolitical dynamics, economic conditions and post-covid labor market changes. our year-to-date performance continues to be solid with revenue, earnings, and cash flow tracking the guidance, which we are reaffirming. the company is on the verge of surpassing $2 billion in revenue for the first time in its long history.
the long-term positive trends that define our markets continue and wiley's growth strategies are tightly aligned with these trends. our recent acquisitions will serve to further strengthen our strategies and differentiate wiley. as always, wiley continues to drive real-world impact with everything we do while continuing to advance our esg and sustainability agendas. and finally, wiley remains a foundationally strong company with consistent cash generation, a very solid balance sheet, and a large recurring revenue base.
once again, our hearts and support are with those in ukraine, and we hope for a rapid return to piece. i want to thank our wonderful colleagues around the world for their consistently great work and dedication in these very unusual and trying times. and i want to thank all of you for joining us, and i will now open the floor to any comments and questions.

[operator instructions] and we have your first question from the line of daniel moore from cjs securities. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, brian. good morning, christina. thanks for taking the questions.
start with research, if i could. maybe just talk about what's driving the acceleration and growth in publishing platforms. and do we expect above-trend growth to continue here in the near term?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're -- as you know, we're very excited about our opportunities on the solutions side of that business. what's driving it today is consistent growth across most of the segments. we're seeing very, very good growth incorporate solutions.
we are seeing good growth in -- across all of our platforms that we're moving. and significantly, as you know, dan, we have some acquisitions. and one of them, hindawi, added significantly to our growth on a year-on-year comparison basis. having said that, in hindawi, we are seeing exceptional growth.
we're seeing fantastic growth in our submissions and they have recently surpassed their prior record of articles published. so we're feeling really good about that acquisition. so it's pretty -- we feel pretty good. i will also note that we're seeing a really good rebound in the interest that the corporate market has in accessing our huge audience and that has driven our corporate solutions business up significantly.
so we're very pleased about that and all systems seem good.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
helpful. maybe switch gears to ed services, m3 clearly accelerating. talk about how much of that is sort of the market recovering from covid impacted comp period versus increased penetration in the marketplace as well as within your customer base.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, look, it's a great question. we're super excited about the potential for us incorporate talent development and corporate training overall. we have seen -- we have the right product at the right time for the right problem.
the right problem in the world is an enormous gap that corporations see in their employee base with regard to their ability to fill seats with tech skills and digital business skills. and that's what we do. as you know, we not only train the people. we find them.
we make sure they're successful. we nurture them through the first 18 months of their career, right? it's a fantastic product with incredible results. as a result, we're seeing -- yes, we're seeing penetration in -- increased penetration in the marketplace with great customer acquisition and a great pipeline. we're seeing increasing demand from the clients that we have, who see this solution that's working for them and they're looking to apply it in new areas.
we're seeing it applied in new areas. so where we started with a pretty focused set of skill sets that we were training, acquiring talent, and training for, we're now seeing it across multiple job categories in multiple subject areas. we've seen an interest broadening in the economy from the core verticals that we were serving. so it is not post covid.
we know we had an enormous talent gap going into the covid period and that talent gap was concentrated in tech and digital business skill areas. but as we know, we today have a record 11 million open jobs, and those jobs need to be filled. so we're in the business of filling. i wouldn't say this is driven by covid at all.
i would say it's driven by a fundamental underlying gap in the marketplace that will persist for many years to come. and we have the right product at the right time, and we are broadening and expanding that product to be able to gain more share of the available opportunity.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's helpful. very helpful, brian. let me -- again, we'll stick with ed services but switch to the online program management side. you detailed some of the returned headwinds and greatly appreciate the color.
some of your competitors are struggling more significantly with -- can you hear me?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i want to interrupt you because you broke up at the very beginning. so i'm going to ask you to rewind to the beginning of the question if you don't mind. otherwise, i won't get the whole thing.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
can you hear me now? is this better?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
i can. yes.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. just on online program management, you laid out some of the near-term market headwinds very well. some of your competitors are clearly struggling more significantly, it would appear. maybe talk about your offering relative to some others, whether there's some opportunity in terms of market share gains? and how long do you anticipate these headwinds to last? in other words, when do you think we can get back to growth?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a terrific question. i'll say in preface, as i said in the script, that we believe strongly in the future of postsecondary education and the need for universities to partner with organizations like us in order achieve their goals. they're having trouble.
they're having trouble on a lot of levels, acquiring students. it's increasingly competitive. they need us more than ever. but in terms of where we stand in the market, everybody knows wiley got gold standard services in this area.
and we're very comfortable with our position relative to differentiation and so forth. we just recently significantly improved that differentiation with xyz, because we're bringing -- we're now bringing to the market what we call internally proprietary student supply, meaning we're bringing students through xyz as opposed to having to go out and compete in the market for it. so that gives us a differential advantage over others in the marketplace. with regard to what we do from a company perspective in the marketplace, we are -- i wouldn't say that you can characterize our performance as demonstrating anything other than the consistency of our relationships, the consistency of delivery but unfortunately affected by some economic factors that simply are out of our control.
and some of these factors are obvious, this idea that students are going back to work. well, when will the -- when will that boom end? when will the increasing salaries being offered to students or to potential students allow them to go back to school or be less attractive as they go back to school, it's hard to exactly say right now because in some ways, it's a very unusual moment? we saw covid do remarkably strange things to student behavior. and quite frankly, we're still sorting it out. but we do see -- and that translated in many odd ways.
so for example, last summer, we saw students graduate earlier than we thought they were going to graduate. why was that? well, it turns out because, during covid, they took away more credits than they would have taken if they were out in the world, so they got through their degrees faster. well, who could have predicted that? so we're seeing a lot of these things sort out. so the answer to your question is really as the economy normalizes, this business will normalize, and we should return to the trajectory that we're on.
and while that is not a full and complete answer, it's because we don't have a crystal ball. and so we can't speak with definitive clarity. but i do believe, over time, we will revert to a very normal situation where universities are competing in the market for students. they're matriculating them through on a normalized basis and they're putting them out into the job market.
i will say we're going to see an increased focus on one of the things we're focused on right now, which is these nontraditional credentials and shorter courses because what we see among our client base and what we see in the marketplace is this is what the market wants. but that's just a shifting of product focus like happens in any market over time. so long term, we feel pretty good. shorter term, we're sorting our way through it like everybody else.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. as is the detail on xyz, i appreciate the color there. talk about do we think about that as being -- there's more investment to be added to it? or are there maybe any cost synergies? just wondering if there's a pathway from getting $3 million-ish in ebitda to say, $5 million to $6 million over a period of time?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, that business was growing very nicely when we bought it. we anticipate it will continue to grow. it's going to provide two things for us, dan.
the first thing it's going to provide is going to provide this idea proprietary student supply to us that we can funnel into our programs where possible. and through that, there will be -- there are natural synergies because we're now instead of having to go to the open market, meaning google and advertising to find students, we now get them for free. now having said that, we, of course, are meaning to continue this business as a business, which gets to the second main point, which is we completely intend to be out there in the market and we'll continue to sell these for the rest of the market because we are -- that's -- it's very wiley, right? we're in it for the ecosystem, and we will continue to provide those leads to the rest of the market. and as we do, as there is continued competition among universities, which is only going to continue in the years to come.
that's what we've seen, the leads generated by a capability like m3 will be increasingly valuable in the marketplace to us but also to universities all around the country. so that's important. in terms of synergies, i would say that we were already in this business. we had a small part of wiley that was already generating proprietary leads in this way.
and it adds to that arsenal. and to the extent that we are managing the student journey from the minute they think about a degree or a certification, and they go online and they type into the google search bar, artificial intelligence certifications, from that moment, through to the end of their college career or their master's degree or their certification, the idea that we can vertically integrate that you bet there are opportunities for optimization. there are opportunities for increased conversion. there are opportunities for cost synergies.
we are -- so in terms of the specifics of m3 and its financials, you have to think about that now is two things. one is as a business that serves the marketplace; and two, is as a core capability that allows us to do a better job for universities in their most painful pain point, which is student acquisition and that, that is an integrated part of the rest of what wiley provides to these universities. so i can't provide a simple answer to the financials of xyz because of the robustness of its integration with what wiley is doing. but we anticipate significant benefits well over and above the numbers that are on the page.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. maybe last one, and i'll see if there's others. but you mentioned inflation a couple of times. you're relatively well insulated, certainly to the rest of my coverage list, but still not immune.
so are there levers you can or thinking about pulling to offset some of the potential impacts as we think about fiscal '23 and beyond proactively? and second, to that is how are you thinking about fiscal '23 from an investment year versus maybe a bottom-line growth year? i'm sure you'll give more detail in june, but don't blame me for asking.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
i never blame you for asking, dan. so there's two questions there. one is about our investment expectations going forward and the second is about our expectations about inflation and the ability to offset. well, as you know, wiley is very reasonably insulated from inflationary pressures in the supply chain in a small portion of why we're 85% digital.
brian, did i nail that one?
brian campbell -- vice president, investor relations
83%, yes.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
83% digital at this point in time. and so from a supply chain perspective, any effect would be relatively modest. and the largest cost for us is, of course, our people. and in the current environment of the war for talent, things like the great resignation, we must focus on ensuring that colleagues are not only happy here, but they feel fairly compensated.
so we have to take a good look at that. that's really our biggest exposure. but the good news is our products are must-have products, and we've seen through good times and bad. we just haven't seen the price pressure, particularly in areas like research that others have seen.
we feel very confident in our ability to price both in the pxq model. we've spoken about, overall, we feel like the incredible brand portfolio we have will come out on top as we move to this pxq model, and the evidence supports that in our pricing, by the way, dan. but even in the more legacy parts of our business, we're not seeing the price pressure that you would have expected during this terrible period over the last couple of years, i want to say there's not any, but the reason being, if you're a research library, you can't be without wiley's products. you just can't be.
and there's really good value for money because we put in another 250,000 to 300,000 articles into that product that you're buying from us every year. so it's -- so we're insulated there. there are certainly areas where you could see some price pressure. but if you think about it across wiley, there's just -- we shouldn't see too much price pressure.
so from an inflation perspective, we should be able to manage our internal cost to the extent possible, albeit christina and i need to be thinking very closely about our people costs. and beyond that, to the extent possible, we won't have what others have in some areas, which is price pressure. we should be pretty well insulated there. so i'm not giving the prognosis here, which is the beginning of an answer to your second question because, honestly, christina and i are in the middle of the planning process for our next fiscal year.
we're just looking at the roll-ups and we're just sort of getting through that process. so we'll be able to provide a better view on that in june. with regard to our investment, look, the investment that we've made over the last few years for those of you following, and i know, dan, how closely you follow, the investments we have made have been paying off. we've invested heavily in the modernization of business models and the infrastructure to support those models and customer acquisition, capability development, and these -- and i think it's clear that our investments have paid off.
unfortunately, our markets continue to evolve, and we must continue to invest in the business in order to make sure that we are achieving the growth that we need to be successful in the long run. i'm not telegraphing anything other than to say that we expect to continue to invest in this business. and as we -- we're not providing any guidance now, as we look at it, we'll see the areas that we want to invest in and we will do so with the long term in mind. having said that, we are completely committed to protecting our margins and to delivering the return that -- the consistent return that our investors have come to expect from john wiley.
so i can't really tell you anything on that until june, but we'll get there then.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst

good morning, and welcome to wiley's fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 earnings call. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to introduce wiley's vice president of investor relations, brian campbell. please go ahead.

brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. i'm pleased to report that in fiscal year '22, the wiley team delivered another year of revenue and earnings growth with continuing strong free cash flow. as a reminder, this year marked wiley's 215th anniversary. and to mark the occasion, we surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time.
what began in 1807 as a print shop in lower manhattan is now one of america's oldest public companies, standing out as a global leader in scientific research and career-connected education. our legacy is more than just a narrative. the wiley brand is respected worldwide, and our reputation is a unique advantage that helps us to win and retain customers partners, authors and great talent across all of our lines of business. wiley has been unlocking human potential by advancing knowledge for over two centuries, and it is [inaudible] show through many economic cycles and periods of disruption.
in good times and bad, wiley delivers consistent financial performance by serving the world's researchers and learners. today, we are growing well based upon our strong competitive position, must-have products, a strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow. wiley's revenue is now 83% digital and tech-enabled, and 58% of our revenue is recurring. we have delivered 28 consecutive years of dividend increases.
and we've recently been named the most trusted company in media according to a survey by newsweek. all of this underscores the fact that wiley is a strong and special company, and i'm proud to be part of it, especially now. as you know, wiley is a critical player in the global knowledge ecosystem, performing essential roles in scientific research and education. our strategy remains to lead the market by addressing two very strong trends.
the first is the rapid growth of open scientific research, which is creating significant demand for our branded research content and our cutting-edge research platforms and services. the second trend is the global drive to make education more career connected and vastly more accessible. this economic imperative is increasing demand for our learning programs and our talent development services that directly connect education with employment and that helped to fill the global talent gap. in research, wiley is both a leading publisher with 1,900 valuable, respected journal brands and a leading provider of essential platforms and services that help societies, publishers and corporations to thrive in the complex, open knowledge ecosystem.
in education, wiley delivers both powerful learning products in the form of digital content and courseware and tech-enabled services in the form of degree programs, certifications, and on-the-job training. these products and services help universities to deliver career-connected degrees and drive enrollment, help corporations to build the workforces they need to win and ultimately helps learners and professionals to build the skills they need to achieve long-term career success. in fiscal '22, the complex global environment delivered us some unusual challenges. most significantly, we saw post lockdown enrollment softness in universities affect demand for our education programs.
we also saw an unusually tight labor market and rising inflation, put some pressure on compensation levels. and we saw some geopolitical issues introduce instability into global markets. but despite all this, the wiley team was able to deliver on our outlook for both revenue and earnings and exceed our outlook for cash flow. we saw an acceleration of organic revenue growth in fiscal '22 into the mid-single digits.
all three wiley segments were up over prior year. as noted, we did run into some challenges stemming from some unusual lower university enrollment patterns. but while our university services and education publishing lines were slowed by this, we still delivered on our financial targets, thanks to strong organic growth across research and in corporate talent development and professional learning. on the profit side, adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps rose 3% and 4%, with revenue performance partially offset by investments in growth and optimization initiatives.
notably, since fiscal '20, wiley has executed its strategic plans very effectively, allowing us to succeed through the covid lockdown period. the net result is two-year cagrs for revenue, eps, and free cash flow of 7%, 12%, and 14%. that said, as we know, the macroeconomic environment is presenting uncertainty. wiley and its markets tend to hold up well in economic downturns, thanks to the essential nature of research and our role in it.
and thanks to the countercyclical nature of higher education enrollment. nonetheless, we are watching conditions very closely, carefully managing risk, and keeping our powder dry to ensure that we can adapt to events as they unfold. let's take a look at how we executed on our stated plans this past year. at this time last year, we laid out four commitments for research.
we said we would publish more, a simple statement, but that's what the world wants, and that's what drives our success. we said we would integrate and drive synergies from hindawi, the leading oa publisher, we acquired in fiscal '21. we said we would scale the platform and service offerings for our partners in the research ecosystem. and finally, we said we would increase the productivity and efficiency of our publishing operations.
i'm pleased to report that we executed each of these four imperatives well, and the results speak for themselves. we published more growing article output by 7%, while organic output was down from last year's 15% covid-induced surge, the two-year trend line was positive compounding at 6%. we expect year-over-year organic output growth to resume in fiscal '23. hindawi performed at a very high level this year, delivering strong double-digit organic revenue growth and 36% article output growth on a pro forma basis and has achieved this with exceptional margins.
we have now completed the integration, and we are benefiting significantly from hindawi's industry-leading open publishing practices and its highly efficient systems. as planned, we scaled our research solutions business. we signed up 36 new partners, bringing us to over 450 society and corporate customers taking advantage of our broad range of essential research platforms and services. we see lots of opportunity for upselling and cross-selling to increase lifetime customer value.
critically, 16% of our solutions customers now subscribe to more than one of our services, and 4% to subscribe to more than two. we are now seeing increasing ltv as we continue to expand our long-standing client relationships. finally, we entered fiscal '22 with the intention of driving automation, intelligence, and efficiency across the research publishing process. we're making good progress across our most critical productivity metrics, such as the referral rate of rejected articles from one wiley journal to another and the reduction of the article cycle time from acceptance to publication, both of which benefit our researchers while delivering more revenue and profit to wiley.
notably, over 50% of our rejected authors are now offered another wiley option to publish. this is up from 33% in fiscal '21. this is facilitated by a highly automated intelligent process. as you know, wiley does not publish 70% of the articles we receive, much of it due to improper fit with the journal to which it is first submitted.
capitalizing on this opportunity across our full 1,900 journal portfolio will take time, but we're making very good progress. so we are executing our plans in research and performing very well. despite the world's uncertainties, wiley research remains a very strong business with a good growth trajectory, strategic momentum, and a recession-tolerant profile. scientific and technical research is driven by an ever-increasing global r&d spend.
since 2000, through multiple recessions global r&d has more than tripled to $2.4 trillion. now to the achievement of our fiscal '22 commitments in education. as a reminder, demand for online education and digital courseware was significantly amplified in fiscal '21 as covid drove record numbers of students into digital settings. in fiscal '22, there was a natural reversion in online enrollment.
this snapback was accompanied by unusually strong labor market that enticed many students to forgo school for opportunities in the workforce. the net result was a challenging enrollment cycle across higher education. a recent report showed that total university enrollment was down over 4% this spring after declining 3% in the fall. this variability weighed on our university services and education publishing lines, which saw declined this year of 1% and 4%.
despite the challenge of this moment, our mid-to-long-term outlook for higher education and digital education, in particular, remains very positive. we study this market very closely, and we see long-term underlying growth in demand for online higher education, digital curriculum, and importantly, corporate talent development, where we are expanding and where enduring skill and talent gaps will continue to drive growth. wiley is well prepared to capitalize on these significant opportunities due to the consistent execution of our strategic plans. to that end, we made a set of commitments a year ago in education.
these were to expand online programs and drive online enrollment, to expand student acquisition capabilities, to scale digital content and courseware, and to expand our corporate talent development relationship. in university services, we signed up five full-service partners in fiscal '22, offsetting three nonrenewing partners for a total partner count of 68. we also added 81 new degree and certification programs in high-demand fields such as business, healthcare, computer science, and engineering. this is far ahead of the 40-plus programs we signed up in fiscal '21 and is well aligned with our disciplined approach to focusing on high-demand careers and disciplines.
and while enrollment slowed across the market, wiley improved our ability to compete in the market for students by significantly expanding our proprietary student acquisition capabilities. in short, the ability to efficiently attract and enroll students is the defining capability that drives university success. and this is their single biggest challenge. the acquisition of xyz media, a clear leader in student marketing made wiley a leader in what matters most, driving enrollment.
and this proprietary capability is now allowing us to do so at a lower cost per student thus driving both growth and profitability. in education content and courseware, we saw a healthy growth in digital content and zybooks courseware, although these gains were offset by declines in print course material, and of course, we're on legacy platforms. zybooks continues to be a very good story for us with adoptions now in over 900 institutions, revenue growth of 15%. wiley's corporate talent development line had a huge year in fiscal '22 with record placements and over 70% revenue growth.
we signed 19 new global clients, expanding into new industry verticals such as technology and consumer goods and launched an upskilling program that will significantly increase the lifetime value of our clients. corporate talent development has become a major growth driver for wiley. note that we recently branded our talent development platform from three to wiley edge. the name not only leverages the strong wiley brand, it also says what we do for our partners and for emerging talent everywhere.
we give them a meaningful edge in a hypercompetitive world. wiley continues to drive real-world impact through our core business activities in research and education, and we're always focused on increasing this impact. in january '21, we signed the un global compact, a pledge to drive business action in support of achieving 17 un sustainable development goals. we continue to pursue these critical goals by simply doing what we do best, enabling discovery, powering education, and shaping workforces.
through our leadership in open research, wiley is delivering more brand-new knowledge to the world faster, fulfilling many un sustainable development goals, including good health and well-being and climate action. in career-connected education, we are actively improving access to high-impact learning and good jobs. in fact, over 50% of our it placement candidates in canada, u.s., and u.k. now come from underrepresented populations.
in india, for example, we are delivering impact to at-risk groups such as those from households earning less than $500 a month. nearly half of our career credential candidates in india are women. in this way, wiley is working to fulfill un sustainable development goals for both quality education and reduced inequalities. we continue to make material progress in our corporate esg efforts.
we set out to be a carbon-neutral certified company across our global operations again this year, and we achieved it. more importantly, we are rapidly advancing toward science-based targets, which will provide us with a clear route to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our carbon footprint. all of this is to say that at wiley, we take our commitment to positive impact very seriously and that we are making very good progress. with that, i'll pass the call over to christina to take you through our q4 results, our segment performance, our financial position, and our outlook for fiscal '23.
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning, everyone. i want to start by acknowledging the wiley team for delivering another solid year overall. first, let's talk about q4. note that all variances exclude currency impact.
for the quarter, wiley delivered revenue growth of 4% or 2% organic, with continued momentum in research and corporate talent development. this offset market-driven declines in university services, education publishing, and professional publishing. adjusted ebitda was flat to prior year, and adjusted eps was down 6%, mainly due to the revenue decline in academic & professional learning, or apl, and planned second half investments in key growth areas. before i dive into our market performance, i want to comment on our current macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties and how they relate to wiley.
as a reminder, both russia and ukraine are very small markets for us, so we do not expect any material revenue impact from the crisis. wiley does have a technology development center in russia, one of several around the world, and we've exercised contingency plans to ensure business continuity. with regard to inflation, i would expect wage pressure in fiscal year '23 and some inflationary pressure on print publishing costs, both of which are reflected in our outlook. in terms of other supply chain issues, none have yet to be material and are largely digital in nature and limits any significant impact.
as a reminder, physical products make up only about 17% of revenue. we are also closely monitoring inflationary impacts on consumer spending, which would impact more discretionary parts of our business such as professional books. as brian noted, historically speaking, wiley has held up well through difficult economic periods. this is because we're at the center of the global research ecosystem, delivering must-have content and platforms.
and while we're currently working through enrollment challenges, in general, the education sector is countercyclical in times of market contraction. nonetheless, in this period of economic uncertainty, we will be nimble, prudent, and highly disciplined to maximize our resiliency. now on to our segments. note that beginning in q1, we will be changing our research segment reporting to reflect both research publishing, which will account for 85% of the segment, and research solutions, which will account for 15%.
research solutions will include platforms, corporate solutions, and services for societies and other publishers. it will replace the current platform's reporting line. for the year, research continued to deliver consistent revenue and profit growth, with revenue up 9% or 5% organic and adjusted ebitda up 10%. our ebitda margin was 35% and is in line with prior year.
performance was driven by solid growth in both publishing and solutions. for the quarter, revenue rose 8% or 6% organic and adjusted ebitda was up 12%. in fiscal '22, strong momentum continued for our transformational read and published models, with 27 major signings with large university consortia around the world. as a reminder, these multiyear agreements will continue to replace our legacy read-only subscription deals, which were limited from a growth perspective.
brian discussed article output, so i won't repeat it here, except to highlight that we expect to resume our historical trend line of steady overall output growth in fiscal '23. finally, research solutions continues to see strong demand with platform revenues up 27% for the year or 8% organic and corporate solutions up 17%. on the corporate side, advertising, career centers, and spectral databases were all up 20% for the year. in summary, we continue to see strong momentum across research.
this is reflected in our consistent operating performance and in the continued success of our profitable growth strategies. on to apl. revenue in the segment was up 1% this year with growth in professional learning offsetting a decline in education publishing. adjusted ebitda was up 10% due to revenue mix and lower employee costs for a full year ebitda margin of 28%.
that's up from 26% in the prior year. for the quarter, revenue and adjusted ebitda were down 5% and 3%, mainly due to difficult market conditions. within this segment, as discussed, ed publishing performance continued to be hindered by lower u.s. enrollment and unfavorable comparison to last year's digital content and courseware surge due to covid.
the end result was a 4% decline in ed publishing revenue. professional learning revenue was up 6% for the year, driven by growth in corporate training and professional publishing. i'm happy to report that corporate training has now fully recovered to pre-covid levels and continue to show strong momentum in both virtual and in-person delivery, resulting in double-digit growth for the year and in the quarter. this q4 growth for corporate training was offset by a professional publishing decline mainly due to an unfavorable comparison to prior year.
in summary, apl was up slightly for the year with growth in professional learning, particularly corporate training, offsetting market-related challenges in education publishing. in education services, we saw revenue growth of 14% for the year, driven by a 72% growth in talent development. this offset a modest decline for university services, mainly due to the cyclical enrollment downswing. as expected, our investments to win new corporate clients and scale operations and talent development resulted in continued strong momentum, but also an adjusted ebitda decline of 26%.
for the year, our adjusted ebitda margin was 12%, compared to 18% in the prior period. we have actively managed margins in university services to be in line with our long-term 15% goal, but continued investment in our fast-growing talent development line has lowered segment profit over the near term. we have a solid plan to materially improve segment margins as we scale beyond fiscal year '23. on the corporate side, the 19 multinational clients we signed this year included top financial technology and consumer companies, and i am pleased with the continued strength of our pipeline.
we grew tech placements 112% inside a key global client for our tech upscaling program involving hundreds of employees. for the quarter, talent development revenue was up 78%. there is a lot of great momentum here. on the university services side, online enrollment in our program was up 1% for the year, but down 5% in q4.
an early read on our partner summer semester enrollment shows continued softness. while we have confidence in the long-term outlook of our digital higher education, it will take some time for enrollment to return to a more normal growth trajectory. for the quarter, university services revenue declined 9%. on a brighter note, we are seeing an improved business development pipeline of late with four new full-service partners added in q4, including ohio university, florida a&m, butler university in indiana, and arcadia university in pennsylvania.
in the quarter, we also signed university of virginia as a fee-for-service partner. we renewed american university, and we added 23 online degree programs. in summary, growth continues to accelerate via corporate services as we sign major clients and deliver record placements. in university services, we have cyclical enrollment challenges to work through, but remain confident in the market and in our long-term ability to deliver career-connected education and credential programs that the market is demanding.
steady cash generation remains a foundational strength for wiley. for the year, free cash flow of $223 million exceeded our guidance, although it was down $34 million from the prior year. this is largely due to onetime items, including a $21 million tax refund and higher annual compensation payments for fiscal year '21 outperformance. also contributing to the unfavorable variance was unusually low capex in fiscal year '21 due to covid.
cash from operations of $339 million was down $21 million from the prior year. with regard to our balance sheet, our net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 1.6 at the end of april, compared to 1.7 at the same time last year. liquidity continues to be steady with $100 million of cash on hand and undrawn credit capacity of more than $685 million. with our consistent cash generation, we feel comfortable at these levels.
and absent acquisitions, we would expect to apply free cash flow after dividends and share repurchases to debt repayments. given the rising interest rate environment, maintaining a modest level of leverage continues to be a focus for us. note that we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates using swaps with $500 million of debt at fixed interest rates as of year-end. the weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding in fiscal '22 was a little over 2%, and we expect the weighted average interest rate on total debt to rise to a little over 3% in fiscal year '23.
turning to capital allocation. we continue to balance reinvestment in profitable growth drivers with targeted acquisitions in key growth areas and return to shareholders. capex for the year was $13 million higher than in prior year, which saw lower spend due to covid. in fiscal '22, we invested in products and platforms in research, talent development, and digital courseware.
m&a total spend was materially lower this year than in fiscal '21. that said, we did add critical capabilities in research solutions and university services. going forward, you can expect us to remain active, but very targeted in our m&a strategy, focusing mainly on expanding our research journal portfolio, research solutions offerings, and corporate talent development capabilities. on average, about half of our free cash flow is returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases.
we are immensely proud of our 28-year record of consecutive dividend increases, and our current yield is approximately 2.6%. also, in fiscal '22, we devoted $30 million to share repurchases, up from $16 million in the prior year. we will continue to be opportunistic on this front with nearly $200 million remaining in current repurchase authorizations. on to operational excellence.
brian and i, as well as the rest of the leadership team, are relentlessly focused on streamlining and simplifying our operations to improve efficiency and our cost structure. to that end, we have already kicked off a targeted restructuring in fiscal '23. and that, combined with real estate optimization, will result in a q1 charge of approximately $19 million to $21 million. thus far, the program has identified approximately $30 million to $35 million of run rate savings, with $20 million to $25 million of it to be realized in fiscal '23.
these statements are reflected in our '23 outlook, and we will continue to identify additional opportunities throughout the year. also, as i mentioned, we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint, closing additional offices this quarter as we move to a more permanent hybrid work model. since spring of '20, we have reduced our existing office footprint by 18%. also, let me say that i believe there's further opportunity to improve our effectiveness through active portfolio management, process reengineering, and workflow automation.
it's too early to comment on these initiatives, but nonetheless, critical to understand that we're firmly focused on: one, prioritizing investment in our most advantageous growth opportunities; two, driving operational excellence to the organization to remain resilient and nimble in an uncertain economy; and three, driving future margin expansion through simplification and cost reduction. turning now to our fiscal '23 outlook. i want to first comment on foreign exchange given the unusual variance between our average fiscal '22 rates, which is our base for constant currency, and the current spot rates as of june 10th. as you know, about half of wiley's revenue was generated outside the united states, and therefore, our results are adversely impacted by the strengthening u.s.
dollar particularly in relation to the euro and the british pound. given the recent surge in the dollar, the exchange rate for the euro, for example, has gone from eur 1.15 for fiscal '22 average to a current rate of eur 1.06. similarly, the british pound has gone from gbp 1.36 to gbp 1.24. this has resulted in a negative fx impact to our fiscal '22 outlook for revenue, ebitda, eps, and free cash flow of $75 million, $25 million, $0.30, and $25 million, respectively.
in the table, we highlight this impact and provide both our outlook at constant currency and our outlook at the current spot rates to improve transparency. here, i'll be speaking more to constant currency. for revenue, wiley anticipates mid-single-digit growth at constant currency, driven by continued strong performance in research and corporate talent development as well as $19 million of organic revenue from fiscal '22 acquisitions. adjusted ebitda at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $450 million, compared to $433 million in fiscal '22.
solid organic revenue growth will be partially offset by higher employee costs due to inflation and targeted investments in research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development. adjusted eps at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.05, down from $4.16 this year. in addition to wage inflation and targeted investments, we are seeing higher interest expense, higher tax expense, and lower pension income. these three items are expected to account for $0.35 of additional adverse impact in fiscal '23.
note that wiley's adjusted effective tax rate is expected to rise from 20% this year between 22% and 23% in fiscal '23. this is primarily due to a less favorable mix of earnings by country and an increase in the u.k. statutory rate. also note that fiscal '22 benefited from certain nonrecurring tax benefits.
in terms of the lower pension income, it's important to note that our u.s. and u.k. pensions have been frozen since 2014 and 2015, and we are above 90% funded. wiley's cash generation remains strong.
free cash flow at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $210 million and $235 million versus $223 million in fiscal '22. positive cash earnings and lower incentive payouts are expected to be offset by higher cash taxes, interest, and capex. capex of $115 million to $125 million, compares to $116 million this year. capital investment will be focused on platform and product development in research and corporate talent development continued build-out of our digital commerce platforms and additional back-office modernization.
before i hand it back to brian, i want to remind everyone that we changed our ticker symbol in april to wly and wlyb, which is more closely aligned with our global wiley brand. back to you, brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, christina. let me briefly summarize where we're headed in fy '23. first, we expect wiley's solid revenue growth to continue, driven mainly by strong market fundamentals and the tight fit of our business with the core demand trends in research and education. we have transformed the research business over the past few years, achieving growth while driving strong margins and cash generation, we expect this to continue.
we also expect rapid growth to continuing corporate talent development, driven by our ability to solve some of the corporate world's biggest skill and talent gaps. in academic education, we'll navigate the current cyclical enrollment challenges while watching for any slowdown in consumer spending, which could impact some of our publishing lines. we will continue to invest in both organic growth and seek strategic acquisitions, but we'll narrowly direct capital allocation toward our proven opportunities in areas such as our research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development lines. as christina mentioned, we are significantly emphasizing operational excellence throughout wiley in fy '23.
the clear goal is to increase profitability and expand margins while powering our growth strategy. while always a focus, the current economic environment dictates that we elevate our productivity and efficiency. to repeat, our go-forward objective is to invest in our proven strategies while simplifying and streamlining wiley. by doing so, we expect to continue our growth trajectory while growing profitability beyond fiscal '23.
building on this, let me walk through our most critical priorities for fiscal '23. in research, we will continue to drive publishing apl growth to meet growing global demand. we will transition more customers to our transformational read and publishing agreements. we will continue to expand research solutions, actively signing new society and corporate partnerships and cross-selling our full offering to the growing wiley network.
and we will further optimize our research publishing operations, lowering cost per article while increasing article conversion rates. in education, we will continue to add to our corporate client base in talent development, while expanding into new verticals and regions. we will continue to drive new partnerships and degree program growth. we will continue to scale our differentiated digital courseware offerings such as zybooks, and we will continue to drive efficiency in areas such as student acquisition and content development.
across wiley, as discussed, we will be working hard to simplify and streamline our operations to continue to enhance both focus and profitability. on the esg and impact front, we have committed to setting and achieving near and long-term companywide emissions targets in line with science-based net-zero targets. so in sum, the key takeaways for today are that our fourth quarter results were mixed. strong performance in research and corporate education were offset by cyclical challenges in education.
we delivered on our fiscal '22 outlook for revenue and earnings and exceeded it for free cash flow. in fiscal '22, we managed well through challenging geopolitical, economic, and labor market dynamics. we do expect to see pressure in fiscal '23, and this is reflected in our budget. we expect wiley's solid revenue growth to continue in fy '23, driven by strong market fundamentals and the execution of our market aligned strategies.
we are making moves to simplify wiley and improve our operational effectiveness, which will expand our margins beyond fiscal '23. our balance sheet and cash generation remain fundamental wiley's strength, enabling us to reinvest, strategically acquire and reward long-term shareholders. i want to let you know that we plan to host an investor day later in the fiscal year with the date to be determined. at that meeting, we will be providing long-range targets.
as always, i want to thank our wonderful colleagues around the world for their commitment to our mission, their continuous innovation, and their tireless work in these challenging times. wiley's enduring success is the direct result of the outstanding work of this great team. before i open it up to questions, i do want to say that our thoughts continue to be with those affected by the terrible situation in ukraine. wiley continues to support humanitarian efforts in that region as we hope and pray for a path to peace.
i want to thank all of you for joining us. i will now open the floor to any comments and any questions.

[operator instructions]. your question comes from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, brian. good morning, christina.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
apologize in advance, as i've got -- i'm going to ask a few different routes here, but appreciate your patience and the color. first, on a constant currency basis, what are the implied ebitda margins for fiscal '23 across segments, if not exact terms, then at least directionally? what do we expect for research apl and services before currency?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
i appreciate the question, dan, and i always appreciate your smart incisive approach. i will say that at this point in time, we are not providing particular segment information. you can see that currency has had a significant impact on our projections due to the large swings. we're feeling that because over 50% of our business is outside the u.s.
but for now, we're going to hold tight on the specific margin projections within the individual segments.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
ok. the -- in terms of spending, you obviously have been spending aggressively for some time on growth initiatives. and certainly, in research, you've seen a really significant benefit, higher organic growth. what are some of the specific investments that you're making or areas of spend that are increasing as it relates to research and talent development as we look to fiscal '23?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, as you know, the approach that we've taken over time is to identify where we think the growth and profit opportunities are across our business and to focus our time and our investment in those areas. and i think you've seen over the past few years that this is bearing fruit. we are -- we've narrowed our focus significantly to areas that are clearly both strengths and big market opportunities.
those areas are research publishing, the overall partner solutions in research. and then on the education side, the areas that focus on career-connected education specifically with respect to the fast-growing opportunities in the market, and here, of course, i'm talking about our growing talent development initiatives across the company, and we're seeing those bear fruit. specifically, in the area of publishing, we continue to invest at a steady rate in this proven, profitable, and now after the repositioning growing business. in research solutions, we are continuing to invest in the areas that are demanded by our corporate clients, our partners in our associations and our society partners, and as well as our publishing partners, where, as you know, we're powering the ecosystem.
so that's where we're investing from a market-facing perspective. internally, we're continuing to work on the simplification, automation, streamlining of all our processes and systems so that we can continue to maintain the great margins that we have in publishing and also the great margins we have in partner solutions as this business becomes more of a significant resource to clients. in talent development, it's very clear where we need to focus. we need to focus on expanding the incredibly successful offerings we have for the marketplace and getting it to more segments of the marketplace, more geographies, and ultimately, to broaden it to even more of the key areas where the corporate world is demanding talent.
you'll even see this, of course, in our businesses where we're not expanding investment, but we're continuing investment in areas like edge services, where we are focused on standing up and delivering the degree programs, the certifications that people need to succeed in this economy. i use that as an example because even in the businesses that we're not identifying as significant growth investments, any capital that we do allocate is focused on the same areas of concrete opportunity and proven strength. and i will say across the business, we continue to modernize and optimize, dan, our systems and to make sure that we are less labor intensive, more automated, quicker in our cycle times. ultimately delivering better products faster, more repeatable, more reusable content.
and of course, all of that would be more profitable at the end of the day.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very helpful. and recognizing not giving specific segment or subsegment guide, but in talent development, just remind me or remind us, as you accelerate, you mentioned multiple new partnerships and client signings. does that typically come with an upfront spend for a quarter or two or three in addition to the increased just general investment for growth? just the cadence of as we've kind of run faster, is that a little bit dilutive initially? just kind of thinking about the cadence over multiple quarters.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. good question -- not absolutely, actually no, dan. these businesses are -- these opportunities that we're pursuing, the addition of new clients, they're expanding to new geographies, there may be a little bit of go-to-market because we are of course, pursuing those clients aggressively in the places in the world where they exist. but there is no -- unlike certain other businesses, there is no significant upfront development investment.
we have the product. we can develop what we don't have quickly, and we -- based upon the cash dynamics of that business when we get paid, how we get paid, there isn't a big upfront investment. a little bit, but not a lot. we basically see these as very nicely cash-generative businesses, very close to the point of transaction.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. and probably a question for your upcoming analyst day, but you obviously -- in your prepared remarks, you're still very committed to the old opm pe server or the ed services -- piece of ed services. mid-teens margins still achievable in your mind and given the kind of near-term macro challenges, is there a time frame that we have in mind?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, the answer is they are at mid-teens now. we -- well and christina mentioned this in her remarks, while the overall segment revenue -- ebitda margin, i think, was 12% and we're actually still operating at 15% or above in the services or opm part of that business. what happened, of course, is we have invested in the growth of talent development, and that has weighed down a little bit the overall profitability of that group in the short term as we race to capitalize on that opportunity.
but yes, of course, when we see a cyclical enrollment challenge like the challenges we face, it most certainly has an effect on both revenue and profit, but we are committed and have proven that we can operate our education services business, particularly our university services business at a healthy profit. we don't see a need a need to refocus because we've always focused on that, and we believe it's a good consistent business from that perspective.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. last for me is, i think you gave great color around capital allocation, leverage ticking lower down to 1.6 times. is that still a focus continuing to drive that down lower or likely to be more aggressive in terms of returning capital to shareholders, absent larger m&a, especially kind of where the stock being around current levels?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, dan, and thanks always for the great questions. i'll just make a comment or two and then pass it to christina on this important topic. so we've taken the perspective of a consistent approach to capital allocation for a long time that balances internal investments and return of capital to our shareholders.
and we continue to do so. our debt levels are an important part of that equation, and we are comfortable where we are. we are not looking to increase or decrease it. we view our -- this is really important point from the perspective of our investors.
we view that we've been on a journey for a long time. that journey was a journey that required us or that asked us to find the opportunities of growth and the massive opportunities in the marketplace of research and education. we've now identified those areas of opportunity. those areas of opportunity we've outlined specifically in our script, and i won't repeat them now, but they're paying off.
and so wiley over the last four or five years, has transformed itself from a company where we didn't know where the growth was going to come from, to a company that has clear and identified opportunities for growth. and we have invested in those opportunities. those opportunities are paying off. you've seen our growth tick up.
and over the last couple of years, as per the metrics that christina had outlined, we've been growing our top line and our bottom line. now we are at the point in this journey when we need to start to return margin to our investors. we have to start to convert that growth into free cash flow. and that is an increasing volumes and increasing percentages.
and we are definitively committed to that. now, why am i going on about this in response to your question? well, the answer is that -- my answer is a foundation for everything we're doing right now. we have a debt level that is completely acceptable right now to us. we have -- we exist in recession tolerant businesses.
research is a must-have product and the players that are in that segment that we service through our partner solutions business, also are part of that recession-tolerant ecosystem. on the education side, we tend to benefit from recessions, albeit at somewhat of a lag. but these are good businesses for us to be in. there are growth opportunities where we've identified, and we intend to continue to invest in those growth opportunities.
we did not allocate a lot of capital for acquisitions last year. we continue to be strategic in our focus about acquisitions -- on acquisitions to fund those strategies. should we find those and we will continue to do so at levels like the levels you've seen over the last few years? should we need to, of course, we can use the headroom we have in order to pursue those really good growth strategies. but for now, we're pretty comfortable with where we stand and we like the idea that in these uncertain times, in these uncertain times, we have dry powder to invest.
we have the ability to pay it down. i'll let christina talk about her perspectives on this topic because it's important for you to hear from her. but on all of these issues, we are staying the course. we've identified our opportunities.
we have dry powder to attack those opportunities. we're committed to returning capital and increase our operating leverage on behalf of our investors. and we like where we sit, dan. so it's a long-winded question, but a couple of things i wanted to lay down as foundation for this important question about debt.
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
thanks, brian. i think it's very well said. just to reiterate, we are comfortable with where we are at 1.6%, down from 1.7% last year. we've got room to go higher over 2%, but there's no plan to do that.
it's really going to be -- we're going to be very mindful of interest expense, our macro environment, and really the opportunities in front of us. so we feel very good. we have a good buyback program, and we continue to say the course there as well, and we will adjust as necessary, but very good shape.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. appreciate --
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dan.
operator
[operator instructions]. there are no further questions at this time. i will turn the call back over to mr. napack for closing remarks.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll make a few closing remarks before i move on -- to looking toward the future. so while we haven't provided any long-term guidance, we do expect to provide long-term guidance at our investor day that is coming up, which i hope you will all attend. we're very excited about the future of this company.
we look forward to talking to you. at that time, we're going to be talking about this trajectory we're on to turn our growth, which we're confident in, into increasing operating leverage. and as you look across our segments, what you will see is that we have increasing -- we have consistent confidence in our ability to maintain our margins, our ebitda margins, and our operating income margins in the research publishing business. we've proven that we can do that as we move through the transformation.
we've found growth. we have found it at consistent margins. we like the look of the partner solutions business and where that's going. these are businesses that are software and tech-enabled services where we expect to generate very good operating return.
and at our investor day, we'll talk more about that. as we look across our other segments on our -- on the apl side, we have businesses that tend to return over time, very good, consistent earnings back to the company, they've dipped a little as we have gone through some of these cyclical trends with regard to enrollment and even longer as we've gone through transformations of those businesses. and while we're not providing outlook on the future of, say, our ed pub business, what i am saying is we like the way that business fits into our portfolio, and we like the fact we are confident in the fact that we can continue to generate very solid earnings off of the revenue there. so while not a growth engine for us, it's an important component of our actively managed portfolio, which are the words christina used in her remarks earlier.
so we're very confident in the future of that business, and that business is doing its pivot as well. and as it pivots toward these career-connected opportunities, again, you look at zybooks, very career connected, very good margins. we will be increasingly in businesses that we can not only generate a little bit of growth out of but also generate good margins. and i've already made comments on the margins with respect to our education services business.
and so i won't underline those, but all that does -- all of that should give confidence that now we are at a stage where wiley, with its intense focus that christina mentioned earlier on operational excellence, can start to generate the operating leverage that our investors seek and that they deserve. so with that, i will thank you for attending. i look forward to talking to you at our next conference call. and then look forward to hoping to see you all at investor day as we get that set up.
thanks very much.

thank you, and hello, everyone. i'm joined by brian napack, wiley's president and ceo; and christina van tassell, executive vice president and cfo. a few reminders to start. the call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements.
you shouldn't rely on these statements as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our sec filings. the company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. also, wiley provides non-gaap measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends. these measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by u.s.
gaap. and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under gaap. unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-gaap metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency. after the call, a copy of the presentation and a transcript and playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page at investors.wiley.com.
i'll now turn the call over to brian napack. 
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
good morning everyone, and welcome to wiley's q1 earnings call. before i get to our q1 results, i want to touch on a couple of foundational topics. wiley like all companies is operating today in an uncertain global economy and continues to pose a variety of interesting and novel challenges. despite this, our underlying markets remain strong and opportunity rich, and we are successfully executing our focus strategy.
the evidence is in our current momentum. wiley performs well through challenging economic cycles and periods of disruption. it does this for two primary reasons. first, scientific research is indispensable to economic progress and thus global spending on it continues through the cycles.
second, higher education enrollment tends to be countercyclical as workers react to soft labor markets by investing in themselves and their futures. because of these factors, wiley can take the long view and it is benefiting from this today. our core strengths serve us well in good times and bad. these strengths include, must have brands and an ability to create and distribute world-class content and tech-enabled services, all of which move the needle for researchers, learners, and leaders who use new knowledge and skills to achieve their objectives.
and all of this is supported by consistently strong wiley balance sheet and cash flow. at wiley we're grounded in 215 years of serving the demand for scientific research and career-connected education, we continue to use this experience to find new ways to meet the world's ever increasing need for knowledge and knowledge services. today's wiley is a digital company with 83% of our revenue coming from digital products, and 58% of our revenue is recurring. over the past few years, we've found renewed growth by investing in transformative approaches to research and education that drive real-world outcomes and these approaches have opened up new addressable opportunity for us worldwide.
finally, our mission and purpose dictate that we are and must always be a positive force for a more sustainable world, both through our work and as a corporate citizen. to that end, we will release our commitment to net-zero environmental targets later this year. let's turn to the key takeaways for the quarter. revenue growth was driven by strength in the targeted growth areas that we have been talking about consistently for some time.
these more than offset cyclical declines in our enrollment dependent lines. significantly our earnings performance overall was largely as expected in q1. as with other companies, we are seeing higher employment costs and increased t&e expenses resulting from the resumption of in-person of travel and activity. earnings were also impacted by continued targeted investment in our key growth areas, research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development.
research publishing grew nicely due to our aggressive open research strategy in which we're publishing more quality research with unit driven pxq economics. and we're doing so faster and ever more efficiently with industry-leading automation. this is what the research community wants, and in fact, this is what the research ecosystem needs. the foundation of our competitive advantage here remains the same.
the enduring draw of our 1,900 journal brands. research solutions is growing quickly, fueled by the rapid expansion of our network of clients and partners. research solutions is a terrific compliment to our research publishing business. and we saw this in the quarter as our pipeline of multi-solution clients grew across our client network.
finally, corporate talent development is growing by strong double digits. as we continue to help the world's leading corporations solve, perhaps their biggest pain point, a persistence shortage of talent with the critical technology and digital business skills that they need to succeed. in academic learning, we continue to operate in a challenging enrollment cycle. the labor market remains and usually strong despite recession fears that many students are presently forgoing school for opportunities in the workforce.
as a result, the overall u.s. spring enrollment was down nearly 5% and summer enrollment in our programs was down 8%. for the remainder of the year, we expect better top-line performance compared to q1 driven by research. we also see restructuring savings kicking in during the latter part of the year.
therefore we are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance, which christina will speak to. i'm also happy to point out that during q1, we raised our quarterly dividend for the 29th consecutive year. this is something that very few companies can tell. let's review our overall performance in more detail.
christina will speak to our segment performance later in the presentation, as usual, all variances exclude currency impact. revenue for the quarter grew 4% or 2% organically. as i said, growth was driven by research publishing, research solutions, corporate talent development, and corporate training. these offset at 12% decline in university services, which was mainly due to the cyclical enrollment challenges that i've been talking about.
also contributing to the revenue performance in university services what are -- was our work to extend our university client relationships. specifically, in certain renewals, we lowered tuition share as we work collaboratively with our clients to ensure long-term mutually advantageous relationships. adjusted ebitda declined 34%, in line with our expectations for the quarter. investments in research, higher employment costs, higher t&e spend related to the resumption of in-person activities and market-related challenges in university services all contributed to our q1 performance.
adjusted eps declined 60% due to the adjusted ebitda performance, as well as lower pension income and higher interest expense. adjusted eps was also in line with expectations. as i mentioned, our q1 financial results are not indicative of how we see the rest of the year playing out. christina will now take you through our segment financial performance, our financial position, operational excellence initiatives, and our outlook.
afterwards, i'll pick it back up to discuss the recent ostp guidance on federally funded research, and then how we're executing on our fiscal 2023 commitments.
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
thank you, brian, and good morning everyone. as always i'll start with research. research was up 4% this quarter or 2% organically. as we discussed in june, we changed our segment reporting this quarter to research publishing and research solutions.
solutions replaces the research platform reporting line and includes platforms, society services, and corporate solutions. research publishing revenue rose 2% this quarter driven by continued strong growth in open-access publishing. demand to publish remains robust. article submissions were up 7%, although our output was down year over year due to variances in publication timing.
for the full year, we expect steady growth in output to resume. our hindawi acquisition continues to perform of our own high expectations with rapid publishing growth and exceptional margins. as a reminder, hindawi solidified our leadership position in open research with its fast-growing collection of 200 plus journals and a highly efficient publishing platform. research solutions rose 17% in the quarter driven by recent acquisitions, namely j&j editorial, knowledge unlatched, and ejournalpress, as well as organic growth from platform services for societies and career centers for r&d centric companies.
adjusted ebitda in research declined 9% due to investments in both publishing and solutions. higher employment costs and increased t&e expense compared to the prior-year covid environment. for the remainder of the year, we see growth in article output due to strong demand to publish and continued progress in expanding our client relationships and solutions. all that to say is, we remain fully confident in our full year revenue and ebitda outlook.
now onto apl, which serves the university and corporate markets with content and courseware. revenue in this segment was down 1% in the seasonally small quarter with professional learning flat and education publishing down 2%. wiley is delivering double-digit growth in corporate training as companies expand their investment in leadership and team development. we are encouraged by the success we're seeing both in in-person and virtual training.
growth here, offset moderate declines in professional publishing and corporate e-learning. ed publishing saw print declines modestly outpaced growth in digital content and courseware. although seasonally this is our smallest quarter. as for enrollment, it's too early to give a proper read on fall numbers, early industry projections signal a more modest decline compared to the 4.7% decline last spring.
this would be good news as we normalize following the covid bump and snapback effect. adjusted ebitda in apl declined 30% this quarter due to the timing of marketing and technology spending, higher t&e expense, and higher employee costs. given seasonality and other timing issues, apl's q1 ebitda performance is not indicative of our full year expectations. let's turn to education services; we saw overall revenue growth of 11% driven by talent development growth of 76%.
we are capitalizing on this massive market opportunity by signing up new fortune 500 clients doubling our tech placements and growing rapidly in regions around the world. our investments in client expansion are paying off and when has become a major long-term growth area for wiley. university services decline 12% or 17% organically driven by ongoing enrollment headwinds and lower revenue share in some recent long-term partner renewals. as brian mentioned, we are working with our strategic partners to ensure a strong value proposition that will lead to long-term mutually beneficial relationships.
optimizing our cost structure and maintaining flexibility we ensure good returns. adjusted ebitda, with a loss this quarter mainly, due to revenue declines in university services and growth investments in talent development. ebitda was further impacted by seasonality as q1 is typically our lowest profit quarter in university services. all that to say, q1 is not an adequate read of our full year performance for ed services.
however, we do expect some ebitda margin pressure this year due to the dampen revenue outlook in that university services. well online education remains challenged by countercyclical enrollment declines; we foresee long-term underlying growth in demand for online degrees. students and professionals will always need to differentiate themselves with credentialing and certification delivered online and on campus. and given how challenging and expensive it is to find the right student and manage these programs, many institutions rely on outside partners.
that said we anticipate enrollment headwinds over the near term and will look to optimize our cost structure to mitigate any revenue pressure. our free cash flow for the quarter was lower by $6 million compared to prior year with lower cash earnings, partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation payments for our fiscal 2022 performance. as a reminder, our cash flow is normally a use in the first half of the year due to the timing of collections for journal subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters. capex was $24 million for the quarter in line with prior year and there were no acquisitions of note this quarter.
we remain active on the m&a front as we focus on our key growth areas, which are expanding our research journal portfolio, research solutions offerings, and corporate talent development capabilities. our annual cash flow complements a healthy balance sheet with more than $104 million of cash on hand and undrawn revolving credit capacity of $532 million at quarter end. net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.1 at the end of july, compared with 2.0 in the prior year. finally, we allocated $29 million to dividends in share repurchases this quarter up from $27 million in the prior year.
as brian noted, we raised our dividend payout for the 29th consecutive year, and current dividend yields around 3%. this dividend streak is a testament to our consistent cash flow over time and our focus on rewarding long-term shareholders. during the quarter, we acquired 212,000 shares at an average cost per share of approximately $47. total spend on repurchases was $10 million.
we are highly focused on operational excellence. we are prioritizing investments in our most advantageous gross opportunities, and we're driving toward future margin expansion through simplification and cost reduction. on that front, we recorded a $22 million restructuring charge in q1 related to targeted workforce reduction and continued real estate optimization. the program targets approximately $35 million of run-rate savings with approximately $25 million to be realized in fiscal year 2023.
these savings are reflected in our 2023 outlook and will be recognized in the back half of the year. we've made significant progress again, this quarter in reducing our office footprint with 28% reductions since spring 2020. this is up from 18% at the end of last quarter, we will identify additional cost-saving opportunities throughout the year. as we actively manage our portfolio, simplify operations and automate workflows.
now let's turn to our full year outlook. despite the unusual, but largely anticipated first quarter, our leading indicators confirm our initial revenue and profit projections. on revenue, we expect mid-single-digit growth at constant currency driven by research and corporate talent development. adjusted ebitda constant currency is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $450 million.
solid revenue growth and restructuring savings will be partially offset by targeted investments in research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development, as well as higher employment costs overall. adjusted eps at constant currency is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.05. in addition to targeted investments and wage inflation, we expect higher interest expense, higher tax expense, and lower pension income. as noted on our last call, these three items are expected to account for $0.35 of additional adverse impact.
our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to rise this year from 20% to between 22% and 23%. this is primarily due to a less favorable mix of earnings by country and an increase in the u.k. statutory rate. in terms of lower pension income, it's important to note that our pension has been frozen since 2015 and we are above 90% funded.
free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $235 million. positive cash earnings and lower incentive payouts for fiscal 2022 performance are expected to be offset by higher cash taxes, interest, and capex. capex of $115 million to $125 million, compares to $116 million in the prior year. capital investment will be focused on platform and product development in our core growth areas of research and corporate talent development.
in terms of our outlook, including fx, currency remains headwind at the revenue line, but since most of our global businesses denominated in u.s. dollars and given our large expense base in europe, we are largely self-hedged from an earnings and cash flow standpoint. and with that, i'll pass it back to brian.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, christina. i want to talk now about the execution commitments we made for fiscal 2023 and how we're doing against them at the end of q1. you recall that we laid out eight commitments at the start of the year foreign research and foreign education. but before i go over these, i want to spend a few moments on a recent development in u.s.
science research policy. two weeks ago, the u.s. office of science and technology policy, which is a department within the white house issued guidance that calls for u.s. federal agencies to ensure that all new federally funded research is open and freely available starting in 2026, if fully enacted the implication would be that all u.s.
federally funded research published by wiley and others from that day forward would need to reside outside of a subscription payoff. while we were surprised by the timing of this statement and are still evaluating its implications, we are not at all unprepared, simply stated the new guidance is fully aligned with our stated strategy and mission and is supported by the strong momentum that we have in open research publishing. we've been working for years with the ostp and other stakeholders around the world to support the transition, to open research. as some of you may know, we saw similar guidance in europe, a while back and reacted affirmatively.
and today we are greatly benefiting by executing against our shared objective of unlocking access to scientific research and improving the efficiency of peer review and publication. wiley has led this global transition to oa through our robust oa publishing program and our groundbreaking transformational agreements. we expanded our oa leadership position with the acquisition of hindawi in fiscal 2021 and are further expanding it with the acceleration of research solutions. in the past three years alone, we drove oa share of our research publishing revenue from less than 6% to approximately 33%.
and this number continues to increase rapidly as our multi-year transformational agreements stake hold. for reference less than 10% of our published articles today are funded by u.s. federal department impacted by this policy ship. and a third of those articles are already oa.
the oa share will continue to accelerate through 2026. all to say, while we're still evaluating the recent ostp guidance, we do not anticipate that it will have a material financial impact. ok. turning now to our fiscal 2023 commitments in research and how we performed on them in q1.
at the start of the year, we said, we would publish more to meet global demand, especially in open access. we would establish more transformational read and publishing agreements worldwide. we would scale our research solutions offerings, and we would streamline our publishing operations. on publishing more, as christina mentioned, we grew article submissions by 7% and oa output by 25%.
overall publishing output was down year on year, but we continue to expect steady growth for the fiscal year. as you know, scientific and technical research is powered by global r&d spend, which is expected to grow 5% to nearly $2.5 trillion this year. we announced three major transformational agreements this quarter, including consortia in france, representing 130 institutions and italy representing 68 institutions. and i'm proud to say that we announced our first read and publish agreement in latin america, unam in mexico, which is the largest university in the region.
the pipeline remains strong for our multi-year transformational agreements. these deals are great for our large customers, and they're great for us as they drive incremental publishing volume and thus revenue in an increasingly open access economy. as you know, in open access revenue is a direct function of the number of articles published and the price we charge for publishing in one of our journals. during the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum in research solutions, to refresh research solutions delivers the critical platforms and tech-enabled services that allow publishers, corporations, and other stakeholders to succeed in the open research economy.
our platforms make processing, publishing, and consuming research content easier, quicker, and more efficient. and our knowledge network enables corporations to reach 10 million plus researchers and leverage 170 million plus monthly impressions. increasingly we're creating new revenue models for wiley and our clients by leveraging these platforms and our network. for example, our career centers help major societies like the aaas generate new revenue by connecting people with jobs and help pharmaceutical companies like pfizer, fill critical talent gaps.
our new product offerings like knowledge hubs and virtual events allow r&d intensive companies like eli lilly and perkin elmer to reach and activate valuable audiences. during the quarter, we signed six new solutions partners, including the american cancer society, the national park service, and eli lilly, and we expanded four other partnerships with additional services and we are continuing to drive organic growth through upsell and cross-sell opportunities with our existing 450 society and corporate partners. to give you a sense of this opportunity. so far only 16% of our partners subscribe to more than one service and only 4% subscribe to more than two.
finally, we are streamlining operations in research, particularly the referral of rejected articles from one wiley journal to another. we've been discussing this process for some time, we call it the cascade. as a reminder, wiley does not publish 70% of the articles we've received. mostly this is due to improper fit between a submitted manuscript and the first journal to which it is submitted.
our goal is to find these articles, another home within wiley's portfolio and we do this through an intelligent transfer and referral process. notably, 65% of rejected authors are now offered another wiley option to publish up from 53% at year end. it will take time to fully capitalize on this opportunity across our 1,900 journal portfolio, but we're very encouraged by the progress so far. so as you can see, q1 was a very solid quarter of delivery against our stated commitments in research.
let's turn now to our progress in executing on our fiscal 2023 commitments in career-connected education. here, we're working to expand our corporate and university client base to drive growth in our differentiated course we're offerings and to gain operating efficiency. on the client development front, wiley signed another three large global clients this quarter to corporate talent development agreements. this group includes our first two multinationals in the insurance sector and another one in financial services.
our success in growing the client base resulted in employee placement growth of a 97% year on year with notable expansion in europe. looking ahead, the new client pipeline is very strong and it spans multiple industry verticals. we're also having conversations with existing corporate clients to add reskilling services to our new employee training services. critically, we're seeing strong demand for talent development services, even in the face of economic uncertainty.
this speaks to the growing need for tech talent development worldwide and the success of our unique and effective models. on the client development front and university services, we renewed three long-term partnerships determines ranging from five years to nine years. our partner count declined this quarter by two to 66. although, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential new partners.
we also signed 47 new degree programs within the existing partner base. this is well ahead of plan and speaks to the importance of wiley's services to its university partners especially in these difficult times. we remain focused on delivering differentiated courseware that moves the needle for learners and workers, where we have focus to date we are seeing exceptional growth. zybooks revenue for example, was up 27% in the quarter.
and the team signed 18 new institutions in the spring semester, bringing us to a total of 827 zybooks institutions. we are replicating this success across the publishing program and for example, our expanding zybooks into other high demand, courseware disciplines. most recently engineering. in science, knewton alta courseware was named the best science instructional solution as part of the prestigious software & information industry association awards.
on the efficiency front, our work is preceding a pace. we are driving talent development toward meaningful profit contribution as we scale through redesign and automated processes, and we are improving efficiency in education publishing through platform upgrades and process improvement. so overall we are executing well on our fiscal 2023 commitments in education, despite the cyclical enrollment challenges. so let me summarize some key takeaways for today.
first, we're delivering solid organic revenue growth through our clearly identified growth strategies. our investment and research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development are paying off. our growth strategies are working and our markets remain essential, vibrant, and recession tolerance. the consistent execution of our research strategy over the past few years, rejuvenated the business, materially improving our growth profile while driving continued strong margins in cash generation.
we expect this positive trajectory to continue. the execution of our high potential career connected education strategy most notably in corporate talent development is also working as revenue continues to grow by strong double-digits. this has increased the size of wiley's blue ocean growth opportunity and our profit potential. of course, not everything is perfect as is evident in the effect that cyclical declines in higher ed enrollment are having on revenue growth in our university-focused offerings.
we do expect that to correct over time as typical countercyclical patterns resume following this unusual enrollment cycle. as we always say, the world is demanding and continues to demand more and better post-secondary education as a core engine of economic advancement. as a blue chip provider of essential academic services and courseware in some of the most in demand subjects and career areas, we continue to see good market opportunity and cash flow potential in the long-term, despite current growth challenges. as christina emphasized, we believe that a simpler wiley is a better wiley.
thus, we continue to streamline operations this year and are delivering meaningful efficiency gains, and we made good underlying progress in q1. our goal is clear to increase profitability and cash flow beyond fiscal 2023, while still powering our proven growth strategies. to that end, we will continue to sharply focus investments on profitable growth initiatives in research publishing, research solutions, and corporate talent development. our consistently strong balance sheet and cash flow will enable us to reinvest in this core and strategically acquire while also rewarding long-term shareholders.
as always our strategic planning cycle begins in the fall. it continues through the winter as we finalize long-range plans. and so we look forward to sharing these plans and our outlook with you at an april investor day. my gratitude goes out to our wiley colleagues for their continued achievements this quarter.
i want to thank them for their hard work and enthusiasm in advancing our mission and their continued support of many humanitarian causes in their communities and around the world. and i will now open the call up to any questions
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from line of daniel moore from cjs securities. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. and thank you and good morning, brian and christina. thanks for taking the questions and for all the color. obviously a lot of moving parts this quarter, so greatly appreciate it.
and i'll probably ask a few extra because there's a few topics to discuss, but starting with research, which is, it remains very solid and robust 4% growth x currency kind of low single-digit in publishing and strong double in solutions. is that generally how you see the remainder of the year playing out?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, dan. well, first of all, thanks for the questions. it's always good to have you on the call. we are, we feel very good about where we stand in research publishing and we are sticking to our belief that we are in a cycle where we are seeing positive momentum in both research publishing and in our oa and in our partner solutions.
so from the perspective of research publishing, i would say that you can continue to see our growth as we have stated grow significantly in the area of submissions we're seeing good upper single-digit growth in the submissions category now, and that leads to an even higher level now of acceptances, which is what you want to see the submissions turn into acceptances. and that's at an above 10% level now, which is terrific. and that should turn translate into our publishing volume and as you know our publishing volume leads to our revenue. so we don't provide sub-segment guidance as you know, but we're feeling very good about the outlook for the balance of the year in research publishing.
from a research solutions perspective, the momentum is very good. we're signing up a significant number of new clients. and as i stated earlier, in my remarks, we're seeing really very good uptake on our effort to upsell and cross-sell these essential solutions in those areas. so yes, we're feeling really good about the momentum that we're seeing across research and we expect that to continue if not accelerate for the balance of the year.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
super helpful switch gears to ed services, specifically start with university services. just talk a little bit about maybe the incremental headwinds, and i think you mentioned you'd lowered tuition share at a certain partners any color on, what percentage of your programs that covers and it, would you expect that to extend to other partners as well?
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we have to think about this business in two ways. one is as a long-term opportunity; and two as the component of our value proposition as we deliver it to our clients. and so if we think about the long-term, we continue to feel very good about the potential of our university services businesses as university's transition to compete in a very competitive world and to deliver on the increasing demand for career-connected education and for online education.
so we feel really good as a gold standard provider that we're going to be there for our university partners and continue to help them and that will translate into continued growth and profitability for the segment. as we think about, so from a long-term perspective, we feel very good. as we think about the shorter-term or secular or cyclical issues going on in that business, we have three basic characteristics. the first one is the overall enrollment environment.
and what we're seeing in enrollment is that at this stage in the cycle we've seen declines across all enrollment of all universities. and that has been significant over the last couple of years, you saw 5% decline followed by a 4% decline. this fall, we're starting to see enrollment decline that is actually ameliorated to the point where it's just down a little bit, maybe 1% for the year. and so as we look ahead, we should benefit from that in our programs, which tend to be aligned with the most in demand categories of degrees and or certifications going forward.
so the first thing we have to think about is the generally countercyclical behavior of enrollment, and we feel pretty good about the future, although we still need to see how the fall plays out and how that translates into the spring. as you know dan, we're in a very unusual period in the post-covid environment where there was a rise in enrollment significantly during covid and then there was a little bit of a settling back. that's been exacerbated by the economic situation where a really hot labor market's just attracted a lot of people to go to work instead of going back and getting degrees simple as that. so that's the biggest component, but there are a couple of other components that you highlight.
one is the number of our university services partners, and how our overall portfolio is playing out. and the second is, the term is upon, which we're working with those partners. so as is always the wiley case, we're working, and you've heard this from us for a long time, we're working to build a long-term portfolio, valuable partners, who we are in mutually beneficial relationships with over time. and that we're not so much focused on the absolute number of partners, but rather focused on the quality and the profitability of partners.
as such our portfolio numbers will go up and down a little bit over time. and as we said, we lost a couple of partners and that is certainly reflected in our numbers, but and in no way represents our future belief about the -- size or the quality of our portfolio. and in fact, testament to that is the 47 programs that i told you about a little earlier in my remarks. that means that with the partners that we have, they value us significantly, and we are launching additional degree programs, all of which lead to growth in the future, because that's why they launch them.
they launch them in order to serve an ever increasing number of students that leads to their financial success. so there's significant demand in our portfolio. the final point about the terms upon, which we work with our partners, which is this issue of the price point or the revenue share, we believe that in order to have a long-term growing business, we need to have relationships with our partners that are mutually advantageous. and in many cases, that means that we have to take a look at all the terms.
and one of those terms is the share of revenue, which we get from our partners, but to the extent that we are fully aligned with them where we're going to go, that we have a high-quality relationship, we're happy to work on terms that work for our clients, because what that leads to is it leads to ultimately leads to growth for us. it leads to our ability to extend our relationships with them, both in length and in volume. and in fact, again, we're, we have renewed some very important clients just in the last quarter. so in terms of the terms, they will continue to evolve, but we feel very good about the mix of business and the terms upon, which that business is being conducted, including our revenue share.
so we don't see from where we stand now any significant changes in our outlook based upon that.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and no significant changes, obviously in the long-term margin targets for that portion of your business as well?
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
hey, dan. it's christina. nice to speak to you. yes.
in terms of the university services margin targets we don't specifically talk about sub-segment level, but from an ed services margin we're actively managing to adapt to the outlook, as we talked about with our -- with enrollment pressures with our renegotiations. and we're really going to look at how we adapt to make sure that our margin profile stays on point.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i'll just add to that. we have over time talked about a goal of 15%, and we're comfortable with that. as christina pointed out, we're not breaking out the individual sub-segment margins, but we'll -- we feel very good that the business can run at a nice profitable creative level for wiley.
and we are actively working both on the revenue side and the expense side to ensure that that's going to happen.
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
yes. i wouldn't use q1 as an indication of full year as well. so that's another thing.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
of course, i misspoke them at the segment margin of mid teens. thank you. is the 35% expected -- sorry, $35 million expected run rate savings from restructuring? forgive my short-term memory, was that contemplated when you gave the initial guide? or does that represent more recent actions kind of reflecting some of these incremental short-term macro headwinds?
christina van tassell -- chief financial officer
that was the original plan that we discussed with you in q4 and we're executing on that plan.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
ok. and last topic and i'll jump out, but brian really appreciate the color as it relates to the administration's recent announcement. so just to make sure i heard correctly less than 10% of journal publics of articles published have any kind of government backed or funding today. but i hear that correctly, number one.
and number two, sounds like this is just more of a continuation of evolution of your driving the ship toward open access. but any impact that you see at all on your kind of longer-term growth trajectory and i guess were you at all surprised by the actions taken any additional color on those would be really helpful.
brian napack -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. definitely, we spoke to this very well in the script, and i won't -- i'll try not to repeat myself, but yes to answer your very specific question, less than 10% of our articles are funded by u.s. federal departments that are impacted by this policy. on underline that a third of those are already published oa and that's rising precipitously as it is across all of our business.
to answer your second and higher level question, we don't affect expect this policy to have a material impact on the trajectory or the financial health of wiley. quite the contrary this is completely in line with everything that we've been talking about on these earnings calls for three or four years now. we believe in a future of scientific research where research is available freely and openly to the world. that's a great thing.
we also believe that we're going to be in a mixed model environment for a long time to come perhaps forever because funding isn't distributed evenly. and some disciplines simply don't have the funding to pay for the publication. and so we expect subscriptions to be a significant part of our future. to answer your other question this is not all unexpected -- at all unexpected.
in fact, this is completely in line with discussions we've been having specifically with the ostp. parenthetically say, i've personally been down at the ostp having conversations with them a couple years ago. and it's the continuation of what we view as an orderly transition to this new world of open research. we've been actively and aggressively signing up transitional agreement, excuse me, transformational agreement customers.
it started in europe, it's continuing in the u.s. we signed up -- we've signed up over 41 major customers. over 18 of those customers or 43% are in the u.s. alone, including the u.s.
department of energy. so this is completely consistent with our belief system. was it a little bit unexpected? yes, we didn't expect the timing right now, but if you've been listening, which i know you do, we've been enthusiastically talking about this transition to open access for both mission reasons and for business reasons for some time. and this transition alone is what has been the engine upon our return to growth in research publishing.
now i will also point out, because it's not insignificant. our research solutions strategy is built to help the world transition to open access. we are currently expanding that business significantly. just this quarter we're launching, we may have already launched a thing called oable, which is a payment processing system that allows the almost infinite number of transactions to be effectively processed, attributed back to their author with funding matched from institutions in order to pay for apcs.
i won't go into the details, because it's kind of complicated, but that solution alone will be a fundamental enabler of the open strategy. so wiley is built to serve the need for scientific research and a healthy ecosystem and a major part of that will be open access. this just keeps us on that pathway.
