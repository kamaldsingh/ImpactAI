operator
good morning. my name is jack, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the meredith corp. fiscal 2019 third-quarter earnings conference call.
[operator instructions] thank you. mike lovell, you may begin your conference.
mike lovell -- investor relations director
good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from our forecasts. some of the reasons are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning, and in some of our sec filings. certain financial measures that we're discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items.
reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our earnings release, which is available in the investor relations section of our website. finally, an archive of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon. now i'll turn the call over to meredith president and chief executive officer, tom harty.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, mike, and good morning, everyone. i hope you've had the opportunity to see our news release that was issued earlier this morning. for the last year, we've been laser-focused on our plan to integrate the time inc. acquisition.
you'll hear from national media group president, jon werther, who will update the progress we've made so far. at the same time, we continue to deliver outstanding performance in our local media group, and you'll hear from -- more from patrick mccreery, our president. finally, there's been a great deal of work done behind the scenes from our corporate staff to combine two public companies and sell non-core assets. chief financial officer, joe ceryanec will update those initiatives along with our fiscal 2019 outlook.
we have spent the last year focused on our integration plan, and synergies are a key part of that plan. we will deliver $550 million of cost savings from our integration work, though we are adjusting the timing of when we expect to capture those savings. that said, you can't cut your way to sustainable growth and as our work has progressed, we have targeted opportunities to position our national media group for organic growth over the long term. this includes new digital platforms, more robust video production and initiatives to grow consumer revenue such as apple news+ and our e-commerce activities.
we're also investing in more profitable sources of subscription acquisition, particularly because we inherited some low-margin, agent-sourced subscriptions from the acquisition of time inc. as we have with prior acquisitions, we're in the process of transitioning those to more profitable sources, but that takes time as the opportunity for margin improvement happens when they renew. one example of our most recent subscription solicitation campaign, which jon werther will detail in a few moments. as a result, we expect to deliver revenue performance in line with our prior estimates, but we are reducing our adjusted ebitda outlook for fiscal 2019 a bit.
joe will provide more detail in a few moments as well. before he does, there are some important accomplishments and trends to highlight from our third-quarter performance. during our last call in early february, we cited the improvement we were seeing in advertising trends in both our national and local media groups in early calendar 2019. today, we are pleased to have delivered these results for the quarter.
in our national media group, total revenues were up 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. total advertising-related revenues grew 17%, and we're down in the mid-single digits on a comparable basis. this is a significant improvement compared to what we experienced in calendar 2018 as we work to integrate the time inc. brands.
while it took longer than we initially expected to turn around the advertising performance around at the legacy time brands, we are now in line with meredith's historical and expected long-term performance. looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate the national media group advertising performance being better than the third quarter. in our local media group, total revenues were up 11%, nonpolitical advertising were up in the mid-single digits. for years, meredith has been viewed primarily as an advertising-driven company, but we've always had a robust consumer business and we are very focused on growing these revenues.
fiscal 2019 third-quarter total company consumer-related revenues grew 28%. this was driven by strong newsstand and affiliate marketing performance in our national media group, along with favorable renewal of retransmission consent agreements in our local media group. we're particularly excited about the recent launch of apple news+, a subscription service that offers digital access to more than 300 publications, including more than 30 meredith magazines. as one of the most successful consumer-based companies in the world, apple's launch of apple news+ is a strong testament to the power of premium paid content from trusted brands.
while we are not at liberty to discuss specific terms of this agreement, the economic benefits to meredith flow from four areas: first, there are guaranteed minimum payments; second, we earn royalties based on the time consumers spend with our brands on the platform; third, we anticipate cost savings, including lower subscription acquisition expenses, and lower magazine production expenses over time; and finally, we will benefit from innovative advertising opportunities on the apple news+ platform. turning to shareholder return, we continue to increase the amount of cash returned to our shareholders by raising the regular dividend in february by 5.5% to $2.30 on an annualized basis. we now have paid the dividends for 72 consecutive years and raise them for 26 straight years. importantly, since launching our total shareholder return strategy in 2011, we've more than doubled our dividend, and delivered a 17% average annual return for our shareholders.
let me close my formal comments this morning with what we continue to believe is a compelling investment thesis for the new meredith corporation. the diverse set of businesses and brands we now own and operate produce consistently strong cash flows driven by national brands with an unrivaled reach to american women, particularly millennials; an attractive group of television stations in large and fast-growing markets; a highly profitable and growing digital business, now with meaningful scale; high-margin consumer revenue activities that are based on both our strong national and local brands; and a successful track record of integrating acquisitions; a history of generating strong cash flow; and growing shareholder value over time. now i'll turn it over to jon werther for a review of our national media group, including our acquisition initiatives.
jon werther -- national media group president
thanks, tom. fiscal 2019 third-quarter national media group operating profit was $54 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $65 million and adjusted ebitda grew to $120 million. revenues rose 15% to $556 million.
these results exclude discontinued operations. as you can see in our p&l this morning, we've made significant progress on the key strategic initiatives that we put into place upon acquiring time inc. to integrate and maximize our new portfolio. to start, we said we would improve the print advertising performance of the acquired time inc.
properties to meredith's historic levels over time, and we did. to accomplish this, we executed three key initiatives: first, we reorganized the way these brands went to market, and implemented meredith's sales and operating strategies, standards and disciplines across the portfolio; second, we invested in sales and marketing resources and activities; and third, we aggressively marketed the new portfolio, resulting in increased access to new advertising and marketing budgets. as a result, third-quarter comparable year-over-year print advertising revenue performance improved significantly, and is in line with the performance we expect. legacy meredith brands have been performing consistently and the improvement we delivered in our fiscal third quarter was driven primarily by the acquired time inc.
brands. as we look into the fourth quarter, we anticipate further improvement driven again by many of the acquired brands, some of which look to be up in print advertising revenues year over year. next, we said we would raise the profit margins of the acquired digital properties to meredith's high levels. i am pleased to say that we grew comparable year-over-year digital advertising revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, despite a challenging digital advertising environment.
to accomplish this, our team has consolidated our digital advertising infrastructure and scaled best audience development, and yield management practices across our expanded portfolio; extended our premium ad products to the former time inc. portfolio; and begun to roll out a unified content management system that will enable us to more seamlessly and efficiently extend key features and premium ad products across our entire portfolio. these actions position us well to benefit from the fastest-growing advertising products and channels, including native, video, shopper marketing, programmatic and social. additionally, we added capabilities in the digital couponing space and we continue to evaluate new acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our digital activities.
as a reminder, these digital activities today engage approximately 140 million unique visitors per month. we generate approximately $450 million of revenues annually and operate at margins similar to the national media group as a whole. looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate further year-over-year revenue and margin improvement. third, we committed to growing our high-margin consumer-related revenues by leveraging our expanded brand portfolio.
fiscal 2019 third-quarter consumer-related revenues rose 30%. these include our magazine subscriptions, brand licensing efforts, affiliate marketing, lead generation and affinity marketing initiatives, and paid products like cozi. our brands continue to maintain a strong connection to the millions of consumers who interact with them daily, and consumer-related revenues accounted for nearly 50% of total national media group revenues in the third quarter. we are particularly excited at our very strong response rates for our bundled subscription offers, including those for people, magnolia journal, real simple, and allrecipes.
for example, our most recent direct mail program generated one million new subscriptions across our portfolio at significantly improved response rates. and an investment in a social media channel generated nearly 50,000 auto-renewing subscriptions in the month of december alone. we also delivered strong growth in newsstand sales by launching new single-topic special interest publications and optimizing our current portfolio. here, we leverage proprietary insights to identify and predict market trends.
we expect to sell more than 20 million sip copies this year, with almost all of them priced at $9.99 or above. anticipating audience needs and providing 175 million consumers we serve with daily inspiration, utility, and entertainment has helped enable meredith to become the largest brand-powered food, lifestyle and entertainment media company in the industry. our goal is to position the national media group for organic growth over the long term in both our advertising and consumer activities. to accomplish this, we are investing in a wide variety of new products that harness new technology and create innovative consumer experiences across our brands.
let me highlight a handful. first, we're developing advertising products that combine artificial intelligence with our proprietary first-party data to seamlessly, and authentically integrate marketer products within our own content. this includes a recently launched strategic campaign pairing wine with recipes. suggested pairings appear adjacent to recipes and are automatically linked to nearby grocery stores or to delivery partners like instacart and amazon fresh using our proprietary shopper marketing platform.
second, we're launching smart qr codes that enhance the consumer experience across our portfolio of print titles. by simply using the camera on their ios or android handheld device, smart qr codes enable tens of millions of readers to connect directly with online content, videos and advertising opportunities. third, we're enhancing our content-to-commerce experiences with shoppable video, click-to-buy offerings, and click-to-cart capabilities that drive from native content to major retailers. fourth, we're unifying our taxonomies or content categorization across our portfolio in key categories like food.
this enables us to deepen consumer engagement, predict trends from our unique first-party data and provide richer insights to marketers that inform both media choices and product investment and launch decisions. just last month in collaboration with a strategic marketing client, we launched a new subscription-based direct-to-consumer product, which we conceived of and developed together over the past several months. early results have been promising. finally, at our newfront presentation to the advertising and marketing industry last week, we announced a new slate of video programming, including an expanded lineup for peopletv, our ad-supported streaming service available on all major ott platforms that will include tripled red carpet event live coverage, the premiere of a new royal show, and the launch of a daily reality tv news show called reality check.
on top of the 15 instagram tv series we've launched so far, we plan an additional five new igtv series, plus 12 new shows across our o&o platforms and youtube. these include shape's goal crushers, which will showcase the paths of incredible women pursuing enormous goals for even greater causes. lastly, a number of programs tied to our partnership with #seeher, an initiative inspired by the association of national advertisers to improve the portrayal of women in media and advertising. we're proud to be launching a multitude of #seeher-inspired content backed by the full weight of our brand portfolio.
these include #seeher story, a 52-week series in partnership with katie couric that features remarkable women who have impacted the world. it will run through august of 2020, marking the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage. our reach to 86% of all women, including more than 80% of all millennial women, and three fourth of all latinas, uniquely positions meredith to authentically pursue these initiatives in partnership with our advertising and marketing clients. we're excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead, including the apple news+ product tom described earlier.
with that review of our national media group performance, i'll now turn it over to local media group president, patrick mccreery, for an update.
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
thanks, jon, and good morning, everyone. fiscal 2019 third-quarter local media group operating profit was $42 million, adjusted ebitda was $52 million and revenues grew to $188 million, all records for our fiscal third quarter. for the first nine months, local media group operating profit was $216 million, adjusted ebitda $246 million, and revenues grew to $665 million, including $103 million of political advertising, all records for the fiscal nine-month period. looking more closely at fiscal 2019 third-quarter performance, total advertising revenues grew 4% from the prior period.
non-political spot advertising revenues grew 6%, driven primarily by strong performance from our cbs affiliated stations, which benefited from having the super bowl. from an advertising category standpoint, growth was broad-based as we saw increases in seven of our top 10 categories, with particular strength in professional services, media and furnishings. consumer-related revenues increased nearly 20% to $85 million due to growth in retransmission fees from cable and satellite television operators. these increases were partially offset by higher payments to affiliated networks.
our consumer connection remains strong. the number of pay tv subscribers across our markets was approximately even in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in over-the-top subscribers. additionally, our stations delivered strong performance during the february rating period, with stations in eight of our 12 markets ranking either no.1 or no.2 sign-on to sign-off. and as we've stated in the past, local broadcast television is still the most effective media at driving retail traffic.
our connection to our viewers, along with the strength of the people brand, led us to develop a daily syndicated show based on the people brand that we've committed to launching in fall of 2020 on all 17 of our local television stations. the show will air monday through friday evenings and will highlight the most popular features from people magazine, including entertainment news, exclusive interviews, feature stories, beauty, crime and more. the show will be produced by four m studios, meredith's in-house television production company. now i'll turn it over to chief financial officer, joe ceryanec.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, patrick, and good morning. i'll start with an update on our integration and asset sales. from an integration standpoint, our third-quarter accomplishments included first, finishing the wind down the time customer service operations in tampa. all fulfillment for all legacy time brands has now fully transitioned to meredith's third-party vendor.
we've consolidated all our payroll, t&e, accounts payable, and all brand-related billings to a single system. this included completing the consolidation of employee benefits with all our employees now on one program under a single vendor. and this allows us to better leverage our larger scale for cost savings. from an asset sale standpoint, recall that shortly into our ownership of time inc., we announced a comprehensive review of our media portfolio, and began a process to divest brands and businesses not core to our business.
so far in fiscal 2019, we've realized proceeds of $340 million with the sales of the time and fortune media brands, and we've used those proceeds for debt reduction. currently, we're aggressively working on selling the sports illustrated brand and our 60% stake in viant. we expect to reach successful conclusion in the near future. we've repaid a total of $700 million of our debt since closing the time inc.
acquisition. this includes $50 million in our fiscal 2019 third quarter, and our net debt stood at $2.4 billion at march 31st, 2019. now turning to our outlook. we expect total company revenues for the full year of fiscal 2019 to range from $3.12 billion to $3.16 billion compared to our original range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion.
we expect national media group revenues to range from $2.26 billion to $2.29 billion, and local media revenues to range from $860 million to $870 million. looking at expenses, we continue to expect to deliver $550 million of net annual cost synergies as a result of integrating the time inc. acquisition. however, we are modifying the time frame to achieve these synergies.
so far, we've realized about $320 million of annualized cost synergies through the third quarter of fiscal 2019. we expect to realize an incremental $60 million in the fourth quarter, and then an additional $170 million in our fiscal 2020. this adjustment is due to several factors, including investment spending to grow the business, keeping certain key employees longer than originally anticipated to finalize our integration and some cost savings we have not yet achieved due to holding the assets held for sale longer than initially expected. as a result, we now expect full fiscal 2019 earnings from continuing operations to range from $172 million to $180 million, and from $2.07 to $2.25 on a per share basis.
that includes a net-after-tax charge of $32 million for special items in the first nine months. now our actual results for the full year may vary, including additional special items that we have not -- that have not yet occurred, and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. we expect fiscal 2019 adjusted ebitda to range from $700 million to $710 million compared to our original range of $720 million to $750 million. and we expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $6.92 to $7.07.
now consistent with our historical guidance practice, we expect to provide outlook for fiscal 2020 when we report our fiscal 2019 results in early august. keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a non-political year for meredith, and we've generated more than $100 million of political in fiscal 2019. additionally, we're evaluating our investment spending for fiscal 2020, particularly to grow the business -- consumer business, and consumer acquisition activities to a more profitable platform, including increased usage of credit card automatic renewals. now i'll turn it back to tom to lead the q&a.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, joe. we're proud of our revenue performance in our fiscal third quarter, and the trends we're seeing in the fourth quarter. our local media team continues to perform at a very high level and our national media team is making significant progress in turning around a business that was twice its size. in closing, while there's still more to do, we've accomplished a great deal since we closed on the time inc.
acquisition. we're encouraged by advertising revenue trends in both our national and local media groups; consumer revenue performance across the company, including response rate to our subscription offers; the launch of the apple news+ platform; our growing e-commerce activities; and continued growth in retransmission revenue and contribution. as a reminder, we expect to renew 60% of our retransmission consent agreements in our next fiscal year. finally, we have a number of exciting digital initiatives under way, including those focused on new content and consumer engagement platforms, as well as those focused on new sales and marketing opportunities for our clients in areas such as voice, shopper marketing and artificial intelligence.
now, we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have this morning.

[operator instructions] dan kurnos with benchmark. your line is open.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. thanks, good morning.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
i was waiting for it, tom. so look, i -- just a couple of things here. joe, can you just -- housekeeping on the synergy delay or whatever you guys want to call it. you've got -- you called out three different buckets.
can you kind of just size up those buckets for us just so we have a sense of you know, kind of timing on all that stuff? and how it might filter through, and what actually some of the reinvestment is?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
i guess, dan, if you walk through kind of the numbers i gave and compare those to what we've said in previous calls as we've arrayed the synergies, there's about $20 million that we would say -- would push from 2019 into 2020. i broadly put those in a couple categories. one, the asset sales obviously have taken us longer than we originally anticipated, so there's some stranded costs. things like facilities and keeping people around to service those brands that we would have thought would have left the organization by now.
so that, again, is a timing difference. as we're integrating all of the back-office functions to make sure we do it right, we've held some people longer than we anticipated or initially with those more in the it, accounting and finance areas to make sure we support the business. so those are really the costs. we feel like it is a timing difference on realizing those synergies.
and so those will push into 2020. as we said, we're committed to the $550 million in total.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
and dan, when you see the q, you'll see the detail. a lot of the expense investment has been on the subscription side and around, as we mentioned, acquiring more profitable subscriptions and swapping out lower-margin source subs that we had from time inc. jon mentioned the recent direct mail campaign that we had where it was cash neutral, in other words, in year one, and then those subs become 90% margin subs when we renew them in a couple years. so i think when you see the detail of the q, you'll see expense increases in our sub line from an expense standpoint.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
and dan, you've heard us talk about this on many of the acquisitions, whether it was martha stewart or rachel ray or shape, where we've inherited brands that have a larger mix of low to little margin customers and it does take us some time and investment to move those customers over to a more profitable platform. interact with them whether it's through mail or through getting the online auto-renewal sub. so we're seeing a little bit of higher expenses due to the inherited base, but again, that's something we're working to shift as we move into 2020.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and the other area that i would point out is the apple news+ platform. if we were here a year ago, apple hadn't even committed to buy the texture product and committed to this. so this is something that we're very excited about.
it's really just getting going in our q4. it took some not insignificant investment for us to get our brands on that platform. and again, we talked about some of the economics that are involved with that. but as we look into the future, obviously we're going to have to see about consumer adaption.
but from a marginal economic standpoint, we think, from a sub count, if we can get people to consume it on the apple plus platform, it could be close to $10 increase from a margin perspective on our subscriptions.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. that's all super helpful color. just before i get into the circ strength, which i think was kind of telling. and for what it's worth, just on your past commentary, i was less concerned with the underlying margins in the quarter.
just trying to understand that -- the push out of the synergies. but just on the sales process, obviously you guys have talked about, you know making this one or two -- making this two stand-alone, does it go to six? because obviously, viant owned xumo, you've got fan-sided within si, i'm assuming that's probably what's dragging this out. is there just -- i mean is there any thoughts on how you kind of wrap this up? and is that really the primary sticking point?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, dan, you hit that on the head. and even though we say si and viant, there's actually four separate processes going on with the -- i'll call them the sub brands under si with fan-sided, and with xumo under viant. so that is adding to the complication.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
and also, most of these, just like we did with fortune and time, both purchases don't have a publication platform to take these businesses forward. so it's a very complicated negotiation as we're going to continue to do some back-office operations for them under a gsa contract. so we have multiple parties still very interested in the process for all of these brands, and we're looking forward to bring it to the end in the near future.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. jon or tom, i do -- i'd love to get some more color on the circ strength in the quarter. in national, it was -- that was, i think, where most of the upside came versus our expectations anyway and seem to drive some margin accretion there. can you just help us a little bit understand better was it renewals of time products? was it better improvement as you guys mentioned in shift to auto-renew in the customer channel and in that profile? just help us kind of understand exactly what drove the circ strength and sort of what you're seeing on a go-forward even without, say, apple plus?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, i think, obviously there's a lot of things that go into the circulation business. there are a variety of different things and actually there is -- this year, we faced a little bit of an accounting change from revenue recognition and how we recognize some of the revenue associated with our subs. historically, meredith has always grossed up the sub price of our agent sources.
this was something that historically the industry didn't do, including time inc. well, lo and behold, meredith was right, because when the new accounting standard came out, the entire industry has to switch to that. so part of that is -- some part of it is driven by that, other parts of it are driven by, you know the direct mail campaign. so one source that we talked about, we mailed close to 27 million pieces of mail during the winter campaign.
this was the first campaign that we did for the new time inc. acquired brands. some of these were where we would actually -- the meredith standard of actually bundling different magazines together to create more value for the consumer, and their response rates to this were close to 4%, which is just incredible. and we've had certain titles, like southern living magazine had a 47% increase in their response rate under the meredith standard.
at the same time, that direct mail campaign that we executed was 14% cheaper for us to do as a combined company with the strength of our sourcing activity, so that's one way we added the margin. and jon also mentioned that our team has finally cracked the code on looking at direct-to-publisher using social media, facebook ads, and december was our best month in the history of the company where we generated 50,000 paid orders through that source that will become all automatic credit card renewals into the future. so the circulation side of our business is really, really strong. we've talked about that for a long period of time.
women still love magazines. and then we also have a lot of different consumer activities around e-commerce, and other things. so we're very excited and we've been talking about this for a while, and it's great to start seeing the -- see the top line growing.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
perfect. super helpful. just -- joe, just a housekeeping. what was print and digital on a comparable basis? the decline and the growth?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
in digital, we're combined i think down about five -- i think we said mid-single --
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
you said down mid-single, but each one individually, i think, jon said up slightly, and so, you know print was what, down like kind of mid to high single?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
q4 -- i'm sorry, q3 as a combined portfolio, print was down minus 7% and digital was up a couple percentage points. that's how you got that kind of 4%, 4-ish down, but significantly improved. when you look at the last two-trailing quarters for the print combined portfolio, it was down 16%. so from 16% down to minus 7%, and actually we see trending in the fourth quarter that it's going to improve again.
so we're finally getting the portfolio of the time inc. side turnaround. i'll turn it -- jon will give you some color.
jon werther -- national media group president
yeah. one thing i would add again to that is, one of the key reasons for our course correction is that we can print it. so we continue to take share in the market place through large agency holding company, strategic deals and client-facing efforts. and if you look at the first three quarters of our fiscal '19, we picked up nearly two points of share from both an industry and comp set perspective.
but particularly if you look at the first three months of this calendar '19, where these strategic deals are largely kicking in, we picked up two point five points of share against the industry but nine points against our competitive set. so we're really starting to see the impact of these large wins that we've secured, and we're very, very excited about that, and look forward to continuing to grow our entire portfolio or operate our entire portfolio in line with historic trends from a print advertising perspective.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yeah. no doubt, people didn't think you guys would be able to do that. so congrats at least on that front. all right.
thanks for bearing with me guys. appreciate all the color.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, dan.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
operator
kyle evans with stephens. your line is open.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning, guys. jon, maybe a little bit more on the underlying trends in the national media group. an update on pharma and other key verticals? and then you also mentioned the challenging digital backdrop, could you provide a little bit more detail on what you meant by challenging?
jon werther -- national media group president
sure. you know obviously, there's more -- there's a number of trends that we're seeing in the marketplace from shift to performance from a more of a branding perspective, from video continuing to be in high demand across platforms, from a desire for greater transparency, and demand for higher quality first party gated insights and obviously a continued desire for big ideas, innovative insights across the board. obviously, there's formidable competitors in the marketplace, we also partner with them in the triopoly. and i think those are some of the trends that continue to create challenges for us.
from a print perspective, i think what we're seeing in terms of q3, we've had some strength in nonprescription drugs, travel and home. and you know in q4, those travel trends in particular we expect to continue. in terms of some of the challenges, as you can imagine from a print perspective, food and beverage, direct response to a degree, retail cpg have been challenged categories and those are some of the areas that we continue to navigate through from a print perspective. it's up and down a little bit on the digital side.
digital pharma has actually done a little bit better for us there, and there are some categories that are improving. but by and large, those are some of the trends that we're seeing across both platforms.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. kyle, when we say you know the marketplace for digital, obviously is challenges when i look at it two perspective. obviously, amazon coming in and the big guys taking more share. also, there's a trend on the programmatic side of driving down some cpms.
but we're rock-solid from an engagement perspective, and when you look at our performance recently, actually q3 was significantly better than what we saw in q4, where we -- i'm sorry, q2 where we were down slightly and then we were actually flattish in q1. so up 2% is a great trend for us and actually we see q4 actually being better than q3. now on the pharma side, one thing i'd like to mention on print, which is an interesting development, and you might have saw it this week. but there's been a big push from a regulatory perspective that you actually have to put pharma pricing in television advertising.
and we're actually starting to hear from some of our bigger pharma clients that they may be interested in shifting some media dollars away from television and back into print because of this development. it's much easier for them to disclose former pricing in print than to actually do it in audio on television.
jon werther -- national media group president
and one other thing i would add to is that you know, we continue to focus. and there's another reason why we still feel very good about our future. obviously, our ad scale brand portfolio we think is second to none. we have merged the cross channel experiences that really reach consumers that represent $2 of every $3 spent in every key category.
we have a real 360 degree focus on consumers that tom alluded to. as consumers can shift their consumption behavior, we're staying with them where they go, whether it's ott, whether it's voice, etc. and we have really differentiated data insights around our 175 million consumers that allow us to predict trends. those types of things are what we feel will continue to position us for growth.
and one other thing i would add is that when you factor in our advertising growth with our digital consumer revenue growth, our actual growth rate for the combined digital business is really trending more toward the higher single digits for q3 and that's how we look at the digital business and its entirety.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. a few questions for patrick on the local side. maybe some commentary on core in the quarter. could you please quantify the super bowl since we're going to be backing it out a year from now? and then talk a little bit about the pacing in the current quarter? and then also just phasing on the 60% of renewals on subs?
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
sure. got it. so core for third quarter was up plus six, and you know, that obviously was heavily impacted by the super bowl because we're a cvs-heavy affiliate group. so i'd say without the super bowl, it was up slightly.
the retransmission 60%, we have 60% of our renewals coming up in fiscal '20, and that's spaced throughout the year pretty evenly with some up at the end of this calendar, some up at the beginning here in july, then at the end of the calendar, and then in may of next year. so that 60%, it's for virtually 20-20-20.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah. kyle, i think you asked about where we're pacing. and i mean, right now for q4, we're pacing up slightly. and that's probably where we would expect to end the quarter.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
consistent with the q3 without the super bowl.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
some of the final force.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
up a bit.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and then lastly, auto and the lmg. where it was last quarter? or where it's pacing in your outlook for the calendar year? thank you.
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
yes. so auto last quarter was minus six, and that's -- breaking that out domestically and foreign, domestic was flat and foreign was minus 10. and we really see that pacing continuing into the fourth quarter. i think right now we've got auto down seven.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
professional services.
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
yeah. but it's offset by professional services, which was up 18 in third quarter, and it's pacing plus 26 in fourth quarter.
operator
eric katz with wolfe research. your line is open.
eric katz -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
hey, good morning all. it sounds like there's quite a bunch of exciting things going on your product offerings and with regard to investment. so i'm just trying to understand how much of this is new versus maybe originally built into your guide? and how much is i guess incremental versus maybe repurposing your typical organic investments? and then just sort of looking further out, are these the type of ongoing investment sort of at these levels that you'd expect going forward?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so this is tom. so i think when -- not tying it out to the penny, but i would say that, you know all or almost all of these investments that we're talking about weren't in our original guide. obviously, we gave that guide at the beginning of the fiscal year last august and when things come up, we're running this business to maximize shareholder value for the long term, and when something like apple news+ comes about and apple engages and buys texture, we've got to lean in because you heard about the economics that we have about that.
when we got in and we start running the time inc. side of the business, some of their circulation practices weren't best practices from our perspective. so you can cut short-term investment and add sources that aren't going to be as profitable longer term. so as mentioned, the circulation business of our business historically has always been that usually you're investing upfront and those subs, as they love our products and renew down the road, that's where you really start to print money.
so those were things that we looked at as we got into the source files and really started running the business that we decided to make investments in. so it's always hard in some of the digital stuff that jon is developing. we're going to be in front of our board and we're kind of finishing the fiscal year, we're going to make some of those trade offs on, you know long-term investment. but i wouldn't think that it's going to be that much more significant than what we've done this year.
eric katz -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
got it. i'm going to take a shot here. i know you've historically said you were a buyer of tv stations and there's been some speculation out there that you're looking to potentially sell now. is there anything that would cause you to sort of rethink your strategy on the broadcast side?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
well, we were expecting that question. so there's -- i know there's been a lot of rumors out there, there's been some stuff in the press, but you know we are not, and i underline not, pursuing a sale of our broadcast business. we continue to be excited about both sides of the business and we continue to have long-term goals of growing the national media group and the local media group. obviously, the last year, the time inc.
acquisition was the biggest acquisition in the history of the company and the management team has been laser-focused on making sure that we get this integration and this acquisition done right. and at the same time, patrick and his team, for the first time in meredith's history, are really seeing opportunities between the local media group and the national media group with some of the brands we acquired a la peopletv and things like that. so we continue to watch the marketplace, but again, we maximize shareholder value over time and we're looking every single deal that comes up on the broadcast side, we're participating and reviewing those and deciding if we're going to participate.
eric katz -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
all right. sounds like some big news out there. thank you very much.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
ok. thank you very much. thanks for everyone for participating on our call this morning, and we look forward to having future discussions, and we'll get back to work here at meredith. thank you very much.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the meredith fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] thank you. mr.
mike lovell, you may begin your conference.
mike lovell -- investor relations director
thank you. good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. our call will begin with comments from president and chief executive officer, tom harty, followed by local media group president, patrick mccreery; and chief financial officer, joe ceryanec. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from our forecasts.
some of the reasons are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in some of our sec filings. certain financial measures that we are discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our earnings release, which is available in the investor relations section of meredith.com. finally, an archive of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon.
now i'll turn the call over to tom harty. 
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, mike, and good morning, everyone. i hope you've had the opportunity to see our news release issued earlier this morning. fiscal 2019 marked our first full year of owning and operating the assets acquired from time inc. and we've been laser focused on integrating what we believe is the best portfolio of national media brands in the industry.
our national media group delivered on many of the key elements of our acquisition plan, including improved comparable advertising performance in every quarter of fiscal 2019. of particular note, we generated comparable advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter that included double-digit growth in our digital business along with low single-digit growth in print advertising revenues at the legacy time inc. titles. as a reminder, advertising revenues at these titles were declining in the 20% plus range when we acquired them.
our team and our business have been -- have made significant progress. our team also made significant strides in achieving the cost synergies associated with the acquisition. through the end of fiscal 2019, we have realized $430 million of cost synergies and have a clear path to $565 million in our first full two years of operating post acquisition. at the same time, our local media business delivered its third straight year of record performance, including an all-time high of $103 million of political advertising revenues.
additionally, we continue to increase retransmission profit contribution and significantly grew our digital business. from a capital structure perspective, we strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $825 million of debt, and we grew our dividend by 5.5% in fiscal 2019. notably, our current dividend yield of 5.3% is more than double the average of the s&p 500 and triple the 10-year u.s. treasury rate, which we believe is a testament to our long-term track record of execution and fiscal discipline.
we believe we've positioned meredith compete more successfully than at any point in our 117-year history. importantly, our audience reach is now 115 million or 90% of all american women. we are a top 10 digital media company with 150 million average monthly unique visitors. we now possess the leading position in food, lifestyle, parenting, home and entertainment categories and have a formidable position in the beauty, fashion and luxury categories.
our flagship people brand is the crown jewel of our brands. people reaches nearly 100 million adults or 40% of all adult americans across all media platforms. it reaches more consumers than the combined audiences for the oscars, golden globes and the emmys. last month, people.com served 76 million unique visitors according to comscore.
independent research is confirming the strength of our new portfolio. in its most recent brand-tracking study performed in may, the highly respected advertiser perceptions surveyed 300 large advertisers with an average advertising spend of $27 million. meredith ranked no. 1 among all media companies for owning trusted brands that drive women to action.
wet ranked fourth as both an important media company to do business with as well as owning a brand portfolio that's effective for reaching a broad audience. we trailed only google, disney and facebook in these important categories. compared to fiscal 2017, our last full year before the time inc. acquisition, we've nearly doubled revenue and adjusted ebitda.
our sources of revenue are more diversified as well. for example, consumer-related revenue, most of which is contractual, now accounts for nearly half of our total revenue. this is compared to one-third five years ago. at the same time, digital advertising revenue now makes up a third of all national media group advertising revenue compared to just 16% five years ago.
that said, we acknowledge the challenges we faced that resulted in a reset of ebitda expectations for fiscal 2019 and going forward. foremost, it took longer than expected to turn around advertising performance with the legacy time inc. brands. additionally, the number of low-margin magazine subscriptions we encountered inside the legacy time inc.
brands were more than anticipated. both issues required additional investment spending and impacted our ebitda generation. once recognized, we tackled these issues head-on, and we are confident in the plan and approach we're taking in fiscal 2020 and beyond. as a result, we began fiscal 2020 at a lower profit point than originally expected, which contributes significantly to the outlook we're providing.
joe will provide a detailed fiscal 2020 outlook at the end of our call, but let me give you some initial color. as we sit here today, we are encouraged with the current print and digital advertising trends in the national media group. we expect comparable print advertising revenue for the combined portfolio to be down in the mid-single digits for the full year, consistent with meredith's historical performance over the last eight years. that's where it's pacing now for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
meanwhile, we expect digital advertising revenues to be up in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. it's currently pacing up 10% range for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. so total comparable advertising, print and digital combined, will be flat to up slightly in q1. the turnaround in the national media group advertising performance, along with continued strength in our connection to 115 million unduplicated american women, is giving us confidence to make additional investments that we expect to produce long-term revenue and profit growth.
these include additional headcount and initiatives to grow consumer-related revenues such as subscription acquisition, e-commerce and apple news+. meredith first entered the e-commerce space with the acquisition of shopnation seven years ago. since then, e-commerce revenue growth has been exceptionally strong -- stronger and offset a promising -- and it offers a promising opportunity, excuse me. by investing in content commerce, expanded digital couponing and in new partnerships, we see the opportunity to continue growing strongly over the next three years.
we also plan to invest in new digital platforms, more robust video production and other activities that will drive increased consumer engagement. the market for digital video-related advertising is expected to grow 30% faster than non-video display advertising and account for more than half of total digital display ad spending in 2019 and 2020 according to emarketer. for meredith, digital video advertising accounts for less than 25% of our total digital advertising revenue, and we typically are sold out of our owned and operated video inventory. we plan to grow our video inventory, distribution and monetization both on our o&o platforms as well as third-party platforms with a goal to achieving a greater share.
both e-commerce and digital have been among the strongest, fastest-growing platforms in media in recent years. the same is true with meredith. for example, five years ago, our e-commerce and digital activities generated less than $100 million of revenue. today annual revenues from these activities are $500 million.
shifting to our local media group. we will be cycling against a record $103 million of political advertising revenues generated in fiscal 2019. while we anticipate some political advertising revenue and also increased retransmission and digital revenue, these will fall short of offsetting the absence of political advertising, typical for a nonpolitical year. with that introduction, i'll turn to review of our operating group performance in fiscal 2019 beginning with our national media group.
fiscal 2019 national media group operating profit increased nearly 50% to $126 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $230 million and adjusted ebitda grew nearly 80% from the prior year. all records. revenues rose nearly 50% to $2.3 billion.
these results exclude discontinued operations. as you can see in our p&l this morning, we continue to make significant progress on the key initiatives that you -- that we put in place upon acquiring time inc. to integrate and maximize our new portfolio. this is particularly true of our performance in the fourth quarter, which was the first full quarter since the acquisition closed that we owned the time inc.
assets in both the current and prior-year periods. we said the integration of time inc. would take time and while not without challenges, we delivered on most aspects of our integration in fiscal 2019. to start, we said we would improve the print advertising performance of the acquired time inc.
properties to meredith's historical levels. admittedly, progress on this goal got off to a slow start. calendar 2018 comparable advertising revenue at the legacy time inc. titles were down in the low 20% range, considerably underperforming the expectations we had at acquisition close.
however, we stuck with our plan and gradually saw a strong and favorable response from the advertising community that began to pay off as we moved into calendar 2019. our advertising performance met our expectations in the third quarter and exceeded them in the fourth quarter as we delivered low single-digit growth for the legacy time inc. titles. next, we said we would improve the performance of the acquired digital properties to meredith's high levels.
i'm pleased to say that our performance accelerated during fiscal 2019, and we grew comparable year-over-year digital advertising revenues in the low double-digit range in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. digital advertising revenues accounted for 34% of total national media group advertising revenues in fiscal 2019. as a reminder, these digital activities today engaged approximately 115 million unique visitors per month making us a top 10 player in the u.s. our third strategy was to grow our high-margin, consumer-related revenues by leveraging our expanded brand portfolio.
fiscal 2019, consumer-related revenues accounted for 46% of our total national media group revenues in fiscal 2019, up from 41% in the prior year. our consumer revenue activities are diversified and mostly contractual. these include our magazine subscriptions, paid products, brand licensing efforts, lead generation and affinity marketing initiatives. we see enhanced digital-first opportunities going forward, particularly e-commerce and apple news+.
as a reminder, the economic benefits to meredith from apple news+ flow from four areas: guarantee minimum payments, royalty based on time consumers spend with our brands on the platform, cost savings, including lower subscription acquisition expenses and lower magazine production expenses over time and innovative advertising opportunities on the apple news+ platform. our fourth strategy was to sell non-core media assets. joe will discuss our progress in a few moments. before he does, i'll turn it over to our local media group president, patrick mccreery, for an update.
patrick mccreery -- president, local media group
thanks, tom. good morning, everyone. fiscal 2019 local media group operating profit grew nearly 50% from the prior year. adjusted ebitda grew 43% and revenues grew 25%.
all were record highs. looking more closely at fiscal 2019 performance. total advertising-related revenues grew nearly 30% to $538 million driven by strong demand for political advertising. political advertising revenues were $103 million.
we generated significant revenues from our stations in phoenix, las vegas, st. louis and kansas city. non-political advertising spot revenues were down in the low-single-digit range. this was due primarily to the very strong demand for political advertising in the first half of the year.
from a category standpoint, declines in the automotive and retail advertising categories were partially offset by growth in professional services, media and home services categories. consumer-related revenues increased more than 15% to $317 million due to growth in retransmission fees from cable and satellite television operators. these increases were partially offset by higher payments to affiliated networks. during the year, we continued to aggressively pursue a series of well-defined strategies to deliver growth.
these include increasing our connection to the 30 million u.s. households that we reach. our ratings performance was strong throughout fiscal 2019. for example, during the most recent may rating period, our stations in eight out of our 12 markets ranked no.
1 or no. 2 sign on to sign off. additionally, the number of pay tv subscribers across our markets was approximately even in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year driven by growth in over-the-top subscribers. second, we delivered growth in our digital platforms.
this was driven by a full year of contribution from mni targeted media. additionally, traffic grew in the low double digits to an average of 19 million unique visitors per month in fiscal 2019. third, we grew retransmission revenues. in fiscal 2019, we successfully renewed key distribution and network affiliation agreements.
this included retransmission consent agreements with cox communications and comcast corporation as well as network affiliation renewals for all five of our cox-affiliated stations into fiscal 2023. further in fiscal 2020, we will renew a nearly 60% of our $10 million mvpd subscribers. as some of our affiliation agreements are a longer term, this will allow us to grow net retransmission. let me also add -- address the current situation regarding dish, which accounts for less than 10% of our total audience.
clearly, dish is trying to use current negotiations with local broadcasters to help get stela legislation renewed. this strategy shows a total disregard for their subscribers using them as pawns to try and advance dish's legislative agenda. we've presented dish with very reasonable contract terms, and we hope dish doesn't withhold college and professional football games from their subscribers. finally, we are launching new programming to expand our reach by leveraging people, the biggest brand acquired from time inc.
our new weekly television show, based on the strength of the people brand, has been very well received by audiences and advertisers alike. as a result, we are committed to launching this show in daily syndication in the fall of 2020 beginning with distribution across all 12 of our local television markets. we are actively speaking with other broadcast station owners about airing the show. now i'll turn it over to chief financial officer, joe ceryanec.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, patrick, and good morning. i'll begin with the financial highlights from our press release this morning. total company revenues from continuing operations grew more than 40% to $3.2 billion. earnings from continuing operations were $129 million compared to $114 million and excluding special items in both periods, earnings from continuing operations increased more than 50% to $223 million.
adjusted ebitda grew 67% to $706 million. and these results include the money brand, which we pulled in from discontinued operations after deciding to retain the brand. now shifting to an update on our integration activities and asset sales. from an integration standpoint, many of the work streams put in place to capture cost savings are working well.
our fourth-quarter accomplishments included completing the wind down of time inc. retail and integrating our digital asset management systems. looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we will continue to execute against longer tail synergies that take time to achieve such as negotiating more favorable rates for longer-term contracts that have not yet been up for renewal since the acquisition. we sold sports illustrated brand during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
recall that earlier in fiscal '19, we sold the time and fortune media brands as well. we realized proceeds of $430 million through the sale of these brands. we've used this cash to pay down $825 million of debt and our net debt stood at $2.3 billion at june 30, 2019. we continue to work on selling fansided along with our interest in viant and xumo and expect to reach successful conclusion in the near future.
now turning to our outlook for full fiscal 2020. we expect total company revenues to range from $3 billion to $3.2 billion. earnings from continuing operations to range from $197 million to $212 million and from $2.58 to $2.88 on a per-share basis. these amounts do not include special items and our actual results may include special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty.
we expect full fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda to range from $640 million to $675 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.75 to $6.20. as tom mentioned, while we've accomplished many of the acquisition-related goals that we set for ourselves. we acknowledge that we are not where we thought we would be at this point in time. as a result, we're resetting the ebitda expectations for fiscal '20 and going forward.
now this outlook is informed by the factors that tom mentioned, but it's also informed by the completion of a rigorous budgeting process for fiscal '20 that's based on the results we've delivered since acquiring the time brands and businesses 19 months ago. in addition to our internal processes, following -- and following the change in guidance that we communicated on our last earnings call in may, we engaged outside support to: one, verify the cost synergies we originally identified and determine that we had achieved them; two, help us identify additional cost synergies; and three, assist with the development of a zero-based budget. as a result of this work, we can confirm that we achieved $430 million of synergies through fiscal 2019, which is actually more than we had originally expected, but which somewhat reduces our 2020 expectations. finally, we have completed our fiscal 2020 budget with an increased rigor, a result of the zero-based budgeting process.
our fiscal 2020 budget is informed by improved visibility into our financial performance now that we have completed the integration of the meredith and time inc. financial platforms. and i cannot overestimate the importance of finally being on one financial platform. that said, looking more closely at the factors that bridge fiscal 2019 adjusted ebitda of $706 million to the range that we see for fiscal 2020, we expect that the local media group will be cycling against a $103 million of political ad revenue that had generated in fiscal 2019.
we generated $16 million of political ad revenue in the last non-election year, and it's reasonable to expect a similar amount in fiscal 2020. on the plus side, we expect higher profit contribution from retransmission consent fees. on the national media group, we have more moving parts. on the plus side, we expect to deliver an incremental $135 million of synergies in fiscal 2020.
we also expect growth in digital ad revenues. we expect print ad revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit range in line with meredith's industry-best historic levels. we expect lower contribution from consumer-related revenues due primarily to the lower-margin subscribers we acquired with the legacy time inc. brands, and we also expect higher production and distribution expenses, including an expected postal rate increase.
finally, we expect spending on strategic investments to be approximately $50 million in fiscal 2020. these investments are essential to growing our digital and consumer-related revenues over time. putting it all together, we see our local media group ebitda to be approximately $60 million to $75 million lower than the $318 million we delivered in fiscal 2019. we see national media group ebitda $10 million to $30 million higher than the $456 million we delivered in fiscal '19, and we see corporate expenses roughly in line with fiscal '19.
now looking more closely at the first quarter of fiscal 2020. we expect national media group revenues to range from $535 million to $565 million. local media group revenues to range from $195 million to $200 million. earnings from continuing operations to range from $20 million to $22 million and $0.01 to $0.05 on a per-share basis.
we expect fiscal 2020 first-quarter adjusted ebitda to range from $122 million to $127 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $0.88 to $0.93. with that i'll turn it back to tom to lead us into the q&a.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, joe. we are proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 2019. our national media team is making significant progress in turning around a business that was twice its size, and our local media team continues to perform at a very high level. in closing, while there's still more to do, we've accomplished a great deal in fiscal 2019.
we are encouraged by advertising trends both in our national and local media groups, consumer revenue performance across the company, including response rates toward subscription offers, the launch of apple news+ platform, our growing e-commerce activities and continued growth in retransmission revenue and contribution. as a reminder, we expect to renew 60% of our retransmission consent agreements in our next fiscal year. now we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have for us this morning.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of kyle evans with stephens.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, kyle.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning. i think we're all probably scratching our heads trying to reconcile what looks like a pretty conservative adjusted ebitda guide with some kind of optimistic trends especially on legacy print time side. you gave us the $50 million for strategic investments, but looking into kind of your guidance commentary from the release, could you put some brackets around the impact of the higher production and distribution expenses in your efforts to fix those lower time subscription margin-related problems?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll ask joe to try to reconcile it for you, and then i'll make a comment about our investments.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yes. kyle, as we look at reconciling the national ebitda, if we take 2019 of $456 million that we delivered, obviously, we said we've got synergies positive of $135 million. we expect digital to contribute kind of mid-teens ebitda. obviously, with print down mid-single digits, that's about a $25 million drag.
as we mentioned, the investments are about $50 million. on the lower-margin consumer revenue, that's about a $20 million reduction year over year and then the remaining is a series of expenses. that includes compensation adjustments, it includes the postal increase and it includes some expectations on higher paper and production expenses. that's about $20 million.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, kyle. and just one comment on the lower-margin subscription. when time inc. -- when we dug into time inc., obviously, in the last year and they had significantly pulled back on their investment in what we would call direct-to-publisher subscriptions.
so over a period of time, you make investments, deficit investments to acquire subscriptions and then you make money over the lifetime of that subscription. well, when they were in a cash crunch, they went to, what i would say, less profitable longer-term subs and pulled back on that investment in the range of about $20 million a couple of years ago. so this isn't the standard that meredith stands up to because we look much longer term. so we're making some -- we made some investments last year, and we continue to move forward and make some additional investments in what we would call direct-to-publisher subscriptions to improve profitability subs longer term.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. you referenced growth in the legacy time print ad business. could you give a more specific update on people from a top line and margin perspective? and then are there some meredith properties that are underperforming and driving the kind of conservative-looking fiscal '20 ebitda guidance?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yes. people was -- took a little longer. i think, we gave a little -- some commentary last year about that. obviously, it was -- the whole time inc.
portfolio was performing about the same in the beginning of last fiscal. and then we made a strategic change and put actually one of our legacy leaders on to people in october of last year as a group publisher, and we started to see significant turnaround in that business. so in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 that ended in june, people was up in advertising, what i would say is low single-digit growth, and as we mentioned in our guidance that we're seeing advertising trends that we saw overall from the fourth quarter are going to continue into fiscal -- the first quarter, and people will perform again being up in that low single-digit range. and as we look out even further, part of it because of the comps, when we look into our fiscal second quarter, things look pretty good for people, too.
so we believe we're going to have three consecutive quarters of year-over-year advertising growth for people. on the meredith side, some of the meredith titles had a little tougher time in the fourth quarter. we could say that since we are so large now, we do see some shifting possibly between different titles. but we've also been affected a little bit from -- in the food category and in the pharma category this past year.
so meredith was also against some tougher comparables from last year in our q4. but overall, we think the portfolio, as we've been saying for a number of years, we feel confident that the combined portfolio, print portfolio will perform at that minus mid-single-digit range, and obviously, we have fluctuations quarter by quarter. but that's our long-term view, and it's what we've seen historically, and we believe now that we've got the time inc. portfolio performing there.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. last one and then maybe i'll get back in the queue. last quarter, you guys sounded like you were uninterested in selling your lmg biz. to me, it seems like you're either a buyer or a seller in this market, and i don't see an easy, clear way for you to grow your tv station footprint.
any change in thinking on the strategic fit there on the tv stations?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
you know, we love our television business. it generates enormous amount of cash for us. as we said, patrick and his team just had their third consecutive year of record profit contribution to the company. we've been laser focused on the integration of time inc., which obviously was the biggest acquisition in the company's history.
we're focused on our balance sheet and paying down our debt, and obviously, the local media group helps us in that area. and then we're seeing some -- finally after a long time, we're seeing some opportunities with our national brands crossing over to our local brands, as patrick said, with the launch of peopletv syndicated show next year. so we are looking to increase shareholder value over time. we've always said that we will look at strategic opportunities for both businesses.
but this time, as your first question was, we are very pleased with our local media group stations, and we're not looking to sell them.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of eric katz with wolfe research.
eric katz -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. now that you've run through your budgeting process for fiscal '20, can you maybe size some of the investments within the $50 million buckets for the year? and is there anything new you've identified since the last earnings call?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
so this -- we -- joe identified and said about $50 million of investment. i would bracket this down by two components mostly. first being digital. so we're looking to get this digital business growing, and we're making about a $30 million of that $50 million will be in the digital area, really related to kind of three main areas.
the first being our platform. we're making a significant investment in our content system. we want to have a unified cms so we can maximize revenue growth and opportunity. that will be completed.
we're in the middle of that. that will be completed by the end of this fiscal year. as i mentioned under my remarks, video is a huge part of that. so about a third of that investment will be in the video creation area and then finally, data.
so data, video and then our platform and infrastructure related to digital. the other piece of the balance is really going to be in our consumer area. as i mentioned in our core subscription business, we're making investments there for the long term for a piece of that. and then we have this growing very nicely e-commerce business and performance marketing, and obviously, the apple news+ platform takes some investment for us to get that product converted and over into the apple format.
so we've been making some investments last year and that will continue this year. so about $50 million in total in those areas.
eric katz -- wolfe research -- analyst
as far as the digital side, i believe when time was a public company, they were shooting for about $1 billion in digital revenue, and i think you mentioned on the call you were somewhere in the $500 million range. do you have any viewpoint on where you see this going over the next few years?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
we believe that our guidance has been -- we're giving mid-single-digit growth in digital advertising for the fiscal year. even though that -- in the last quarter we saw double-digit growth of 10%, and as we gave guidance going forward in q1, we're going to see about 10%. it's a little fickle. we've had different quarters where we've been up and down.
our long-term view for this fiscal year is about 5% growth. and hopefully, a little better if we can get some of these digital investments and content creation going. on the digital consumer piece of the business, which is part of that $500 million, we're growing in the high double-digit range from a revenue perspective in the e-commerce area, affinity marketing. so you put it together, and i think it's still in that kind of high single-digit range from a growth perspective, close to a double-digit growth perspective when you put it together.
but this business now is significant, $500 million. and from an ebitda perspective, you're talking about margins of 20%. so a very robust business that we're leaning in and investing in.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
and the time numbers, eric, obviously, included the brands we've sold as well as viant, which is held for sale. so those numbers would have to come out of the time numbers.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
and on the advertising piece, on a comparable basis -- last quarter and in q4, on a comparable basis, we're up in advertising. so digital -- the digital growth outstripped the print decline, and we see that happening again in q1. so some positive trends.
eric katz -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of davis hebert with wells fargo securities.
davis hebert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for the questions. just a couple on the balance sheet. joe, i wonder if you could share with us your leverage as of fiscal year end.
and you mentioned an interest in paying down more debt. so just kind of curious what we should expect on that front knowing the progress you already made in the last fiscal year was very productive. so just some comment on the balance sheet.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
sure. leverage at june 30th was 3.3 times. we expect next year, as i mentioned, we've still got some of the assets that are held for sale. we're expecting somewhere around $70 million to $75 million and expecting debt paydown somewhere in the 5% to seven and a half percent range next year.
obviously, with continued focus.
davis hebert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
5% to 7% of the current balance of debt?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
of the outstanding net debt, yeah.
davis hebert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
so $150 million to $175 million.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
$150 million to $175 million of additional debt paydown.
davis hebert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. any change to your leverage target over time?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
no. we'd still like to run the business somewhere around that two times level.
davis hebert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of jason bazinet with citi.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
thanks. i was wondering if i could just ask maybe a bigger picture question. when i just try and bridge the simple financials between the $565 million of cost cuts that you laid out by the end of fiscal '20, sort of historical local media group ebitda, say, $15 million to $18 million was at least $200 million each year, that gets me to about $765 million. and if i back out the adverse political ads of $100 million or so that you talked about, that gets me to about where your guidance is, in turn -- that gets me to $665 million, which is sort of in the midpoint of your guide.
and it just seems like with that -- the implication of that, if i just step back from it, is all of the legacy national media group ebitda, all of the legacy time ebitda has just sort of disappeared. and so my question is, and it gets even more confusing because the revenues that you guided to are sort of in line, i would say, with at least our model and probably street expectations. so what is the big picture thing i'm missing? i just don't -- i don't understand this guidance at all. even though i heard all the detail you gave us, seems like there's $0.5 billion question i don't understand.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks. yeah, i think, well, maybe joe can pile on with the bridging of the numbers. but we acknowledge that our guidance for '20 is below our expectation -- below the street's expectations. so we look at the guidance numbers and we do that.
and i'll address kind of some of the factors that are affecting that in a second. but i just want to address, the reason why we did this acquisition is that scale really matters from -- in the media business, and we've created an incredible audience reach that i outlined in our -- in my comments. we also wanted to create financial scale and financial diversification. so the audience reach now is 180 million unduplicated americans, we're a top 10 digital player.
we reach 150 million unique visitors, huge digital business. total company revenues and ebitda are nearly double what legacy meredith was. and our expectations for next year, in fiscal '20, the ebitda will be three times what the legacy meredith was from a national media group perspective. and we've diversified away from just being advertising-driven where five years ago, we were a third of our business.
now we're -- from a consumer perspective, now we're basically half. so the factor is if the patient was a little sicker than we expected when we acquired it, and we've kind of outlined that, the advertising piece of it was a lot worse than we expected. we had two years before we acquired it with their mismanagement, the business was down 25% year over year in print advertising. and then we had a slower start because our advertisers would take some time to do that.
and so the base of that advertising business is much lower than what we had expected at the acquisition. and then also from a digital advertising perspective, as you go back, even though that we're seeing double-digit growth today, the beginning of year we saw digital was basically flat. so we had expectations that digital was going to be growing kind of at that mid- to high single-digit range. and then the subscription business, as we've talked about, that they were holding cash and not investing in the business.
so the base piece of the business was actually just that much lower. there are some accounting issues where the 606 going into the weeds, the new revenue recognition actually pushes out ebitda to the future, but i'll let joe kind of outline some of the buckets.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think tom hit on them, jason. when we went back and looked at our acquisition models back in late 2017 and said, where is that time business, their print ad revenue running down more than 20% all during fiscal or calendar '18. there was a couple of hundred million of reduction in revenue on the print side.
digital was flattish, which none of us expected digital would be flat in calendar '18. and then, as tom mentioned, the lower margin on circ, when we did our bridge from that original acquisition plan to our latest forecast, those three areas, print, digital and circ, accounted for over $350 million of ebitda decline from that original acquisition plan. and it was really, as tom said, the expectations versus the reality in the business that came in.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jason. so that concludes our questions for today. we appreciate everyone's time and look forward to catching up and moving forward into fiscal 2020. thank you very much.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to meredith's fiscal 2020 first-quarter earnings conference call. my name is sylvia, and i will be your conference operator today. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] i will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr.
mike lovell. sir, please go ahead.
mike lovell -- director of investor relations
good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. our call will begin with comments from president and chief executive officer tom harty, followed by local media group president patrick mccreery and chief financial officer joe ceryanec. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ from our forecasts. some of the reasons are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in some of our sec filings.
certain financial measures that we're discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our earnings release, which is available in the investor relations section of meredith.com. finally, an archive of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon. now i'll turn the call over to tom harty.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, mike, and good morning, everyone. i hope you've had the opportunity to see our news release issued earlier this morning. to summarize, total company revenues were $725 million. earnings from continuing operations, which includes special items were $12 million.
adjusted ebitda was $122 million within the range communicated on our last earnings call. our first-quarter performance reflects growth in our profitable digital activities in both our national and local media groups, solid magazine execution in all aspects, including growth in newsstand revenues and print advertising performance significantly exceeding industrywide trends. record revenue performance for a nonpolitical first quarter by our local media group, driven by growth in nonpolitical spot advertising revenues that is exceeding our peers, and disciplined control of our expenses. while we delivered performance within our communicated ebitda range, the protracted contract negotiations with the dish network that kept our local media group stations dark for nearly 60 days in the quarter impacted local media group results.
it was clearly a case of short-term pain in exchange for the long-term gain, as our new multiyear agreement with dish will result in higher fees over the contract term. as we look ahead to our second quarter, we are encouraged by print advertising trends across our portfolio. we are currently forecasting year-over-year growth in comparable print advertising for our market leading portfolio. conversely, after a strong first quarter, digital advertising trends are softening as we cycle against a tougher comp.
however, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the first half of fiscal 2020. in the local media group, we continue to see strong advertising performance. while it's still early, nonpolitical spot advertising is currently pacing up in the mid single-digit range in the second quarter compared to the prior year. with that overview, i'll turn now to a review of our operating group performance, beginning with our national media group.
fiscal 2020, first-quarter national media group operating profit increased 55% from the prior year to $28 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $41 million and adjusted ebitda was $91 million, up from $88 million in the prior year. revenues were $533 million. looking more closely at fiscal 2020 first-quarter performance compared to the prior-year period, digital advertising revenues grew in the high single digits, driven by growth in meredith's programmatic platform.
print advertising revenues were down in the low teens, reflecting changes we've made to our portfolio. these include transitioning coastal living and traditional home to newsstand titles, merging cooking light into our popular eatingwell title and closing money and martha stewart weddings magazines. however, on a comparable basis, print advertising revenues were down in the mid-single digits compared to the prior year, in line with our historical performance levels. we delivered print ad revenue growth at the eatingwell, southern living, real simple and instyle brands.
consumer related revenues were $244 million, compared to $254 million, reflecting the portfolio changes. so far, in fiscal 2020, we have completed or announced additional changes to our national media group to position it for revenue and profit growth over time. these include launching new products, including a partnership with drew and jonathan scott, a property brothers fame for a new lifestyle magazine that will launch in january 2020 on the newsstand with a premium $9.99 cover price and an initial 600,000 print run. we have started to aggressively market subscriptions with an offer of four issues for $20.
while advertising will be intentionally limited, we are already seeing strong client interest at very attractive page rates. the plan we are following with this launch is similar to the successful model we established with the magnolia journal, the most profitable launch in our history and one of the most successful launches in the magazine industry history. now entering its third year, magnolia journal was recently named the hottest magazine in the home category by adweek. realignments to improve efficiency and lower expenses, including transitioning rachael ray every day magazine to a premium newsstand title published on a quarterly basis beginning january 2020.
this is a strategy we have successfully used with titles such as coastal living, cooking light and traditional home, selling noncore assets, including the money.com website and our interest in viant. previously, we expected to achieve $75 million from remaining asset sales. with the proceeds from these two transactions, we continue to expect to meet or exceed that goal as we are still marketing former time inc. properties fansided and xumo.
to summarize the national media group discussion, it was a solid first quarter with progress on many fronts, and we are expecting a solid second quarter as well. now i'll turn it over to local media group president patrick mccreery, for an update on our television business.
patrick mccreery -- president, local media group
thanks, tom, and good morning, everyone. fiscal 2020 local media group operating profit was $38 million and adjusted ebitda was $49 million. revenues were $193 million, a record for a nonpolitical first quarter, looking more closely at fiscal 2020, first-quarter performance compared to the prior-year period. nonpolitical spot advertising revenues grew 3% to $77 million, led by growth in kansas city, atlanta, and our st.
louis markets. from a category standpoint, the professional services, home services and organizations categories were stronger, partially offset by softer results in the automotive category. i should note that advertising performance from the auto category, while still down in the mid-single digits, was much improved from prior quarters. combined third-party sales and digital advertising revenues grew 6%, both driven by mni targeted media.
as expected in a nonpolitical year, political advertising revenues were $3 million, compared to $36 million in the prior-year period. consumer related revenues increased 9% to $80 million due to growth in retransmission fees from cable and satellite television operators, even when accounting for the protracted dish blackout. these increases were offset by higher payments to affiliated networks. we continue to pursue initiatives to strengthen and expand our local brands.
our weekly television show based on the strength of the people brand continues to perform well with audiences and advertisers. we have committed to launching the show in daily syndication in the fall of 2020. beginning with distribution across all 12 of our local television markets, we are actively engaged in discussions with other broadcast television owners to carry this show as well. we are also launching a show based on our southern living brand next april.
we tested in our southern markets earlier this year, and the response was strong. given the growing popularity of southern cooking and culture, we are going to air it across our entire geographically diverse station portfolio. these efforts are helping our local media group maintain a strong connection to viewers, as demonstrated by the july ratings period when stations in seven of our 12 markets ranked either no. 1 or no.
2 sign on to sign off. now i'll turn it over to joe ceryanec to conclude our call this morning with a look at companywide financial highlights and our second-quarter outlook. joe?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, patrick, and good morning, everybody. i'm going to begin with a few housekeeping items. first, we adopted the financial accounting standard board's new standard for lease accounting on july 1, 2019. as a result, you'll see operating lease assets and liabilities related to operating leases greater than 12 months in length recorded on meredith's balance sheet.
by far, the lion's share of these amounts relate to our lease at 225 liberty in new york city. you'll note our debt balance stood at $2.4 billion at september 30, 2019, and we continue to expect to pay down $150 million to $175 million of debt in fiscal 2020. turning to the outlook. for full-year fiscal 2020, we continue to expect total company revenues to range from $3 billion to $3.2 billion, unchanged from original guidance we communicated on september 5, 2019.
earnings from continuing operations to range from[audio gap]to $203 million and from $2.38 to $2.69 on a per-share basis, including a net after-tax charge for the first-quarter special items of $9 million. actual results may include additional special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty at this time. we continue to expect full-year fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda to range from $640 million to $675 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.75 and to $6.20. these ranges are unchanged from the original guidance on september 5, 2019, and include approximately $50 million of planned strategic investments.
now looking more closely at the second quarter of fiscal 2020. we expect national media group revenues to range from $570 million to $590 million, local media group revenues to range from $215 million to $220 million. earnings from continuing operations, including noncash depreciation and amortization, which is approximately $58 million and net interest expense of approximately $38 million to range from $54 million to $60 million and from $0.73 to $0.86 on a per-share basis. we expect second-quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda to range from $173 million to $181 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.59 to $1.72.
now i'll turn it over to tom to close and lead into q&a.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, joe. as you know, we manage our business over the long term. we are confident we will deliver performance well within our stated ebitda range for the full year. while we still do not have a clear picture of calendar 2020 advertising demand across both of our businesses, there are encouraging trends.
first, we expect continued momentum in print advertising as we excess calendar 2020 budgets with our powerful portfolio of brands. second, while we experienced quarterly swings, we expect to deliver at least mid single-digit growth in national media group digital advertising revenues. in our local media group, we expect solid growth in nonpolitical advertising revenues to continue, and we expect to see a pickup in political primary advertising dollars in the back half of our fiscal 2020. finally, we expect to renew mvpd contracts representing approximately 45% of our subscriber base in the second half of fiscal 2020.
now we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have this morning.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of dan kurnos from the benchmark company.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company
great. thanks. good morning. tom, just maybe you can give us an update on how successful the strategic initiative spend is going thus far? obviously, that's been kind of a key focal point for you guys given the mix issues you had.
and then we kind of had a sense some of the frequency changes were coming here makes some sense, which -- can you just think -- tell us in evaluating the remaining portfolio, do you think that there are more opportunities to change frequency over time? is that something we should expect maybe with some larger brands over the next, call it, 24 months or so? and just how you're thinking about sort of that mix shift between pushing the newsstand or just simply reducing frequency? thanks.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
great. yeah. so on the first part, dan, on the investments, we're well under way with our investments. we're totaling $50 million.
our main focus is kind of in two areas. one, obviously, being in the digital business that we have and the other being in our consumer area. we've been adding a number of people in helping us produce more content and more video content specifically. and when we look at the first quarter that we just closed, we've had some great trends in video.
so overall, video revenue was up 20% in q1, and video views were kind of up in that mid-double-digit range. so we're already starting to see some of that happen. the other area that we're looking at investing is in consumer, what we would call our consumer digital business. a lot of that's in e-commerce.
and we're seeing significant growth in that area also already, and actually we're ahead of plan. so when you add it all together -- as part of the investment, we're adding 300 people to the organization. and i think we're well on our way. it's not an insignificant undertaking to add that number of people, but we're looking very well.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
but we've added about a third of that number at the end of the first quarter.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
and turning to the second part of your question, we are changing our magazine portfolio over time, and we've moved a few to newsstand only. so the magazine business historically, obviously, has two revenue streams and you kind of optimize the profitability related to that, both on the consumer side and the advertising side. so as we see decreased advertising demand or volume over time, we plan to change the portfolio and look at opportunities to increase our consumer revenue, like charging people more money on the newsstand for specific titles we had, like we're doing with the property brothers and magnolia journal. so while we've had some portfolio changes kind of in the last four months, more specifically, we announced family circle a couple of weeks ago.
we don't anticipate any other portfolio changes for the rest of this fiscal year. but as your question asked, in the next 24 months, that could happen some more. so it's really kind of a statistical financial-driven analysis to figure out when does the model flip from being -- for specific brand from being more advertising driven to being more consumer-driven, and we're looking at that over time.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company
that's super helpful. thanks. and if i could sneak one in, tom, either for you or patrick, just since it's been topical lately. you get dish back on, i don't know if you've seen kind of the sub file from dish, but just overall, if you could give us an update on sort of general sub trends and how you're thinking about it over the next, call it, six to 12 months?
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick mccreery -- president, local media group
yeah. thank you, dan. we, obviously, budget for certain percentage of sub losses year over year. i think during the quarter, they were a little bit higher than expected due to the rash of satellite outages across the united states.
so i would say that it was a little messy. we have july numbers, and i think that we're still seeing growth in the ott sub base, which is offsetting some of the core losses. but i'd say the sub losses are somewhere between down low-single digit.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
perfect. thanks for all the color, guys.
tom harty -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the meredith second-quarter earnings release conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike lovell. please go ahead.
mike lovell -- investor relations
hi, good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. our call will begin with comments from president and chief executive officer tom harty, followed by local media group president patrick mccreery, and chief financial officer joe ceryanec. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ from our forecasts. some of the reasons are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in some of our sec filings.
certain financial measures that we're discussing on the call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our earnings release, which is available in the investor relations section of meredith.com. finally, an archive of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon. now i'll turn the call over to tom harty.
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thank you very much, mike, and good morning, everyone. i hope you've had the opportunity to see our news release issued earlier this morning. to summarize, fiscal 2020 second-quarter total company revenues were $811 million, compared to $878 million in the prior-year period. earnings from continuing operations which included special items in bulk periods were $62 million, compared to $88 million in the prior-year period.
total company adjusted ebitda was $194 million well above the range communicated on our last earnings call. there were two obvious factors that primarily affected revenue comparability with the prior-year second quarter. first, a cyclical decrease and political spot advertising revenues of $61 million in our local media group which was expected. and second, the impact of a number of changes to our national media group titles to enhance the experience of our consumers, provide more effective and efficient platforms for our advertising clients, and increase the profitability of our portfolio.
absent these changes, comparable advertising revenues were up. i'll talk about these changes in more detail in a few moments. our two-year time inc. integration process is now largely complete, and we have more confidence than ever that meredith is at the strongest competitive position in its history.
for example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our national media group delivered results that significantly exceeded our expectations, including strong growth in year-over-year adjusted ebitda and related margins. driving that performance was our second consecutive quarter of comparable total advertising revenue growth as both print and digital advertising revenue exceeded expectations. as an aside, if you look at calendar 2019 and its entirety, total comparable national media group advertising was up, meaning we achieved the inflection point of digital advertising revenue gains more than offsetting print advertising declines. meanwhile, the consumer connection to our brands reached record highs.
readership of our print titles grew 4% from the prior period to a record 186 million, according to the latest data from mri-simmons. traffic to our digital properties grew to an average of nearly 155 million monthly unique visitors according to comscore. allrecipes.com achieved several notable milestones during the quarter, hosting a record 50 million unique visitors over the thanksgiving holiday, delivering one million video views for the first time on a single day on thanksgiving day, and reaching an all-time monthly high of 60 million average unique visitors in december. at the same time, our local media group delivered record results for a second quarter in a non-political year.
non-political spot advertising revenues were up in the low single digits marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. consumer related revenues grew 15%. we successfully completed new multi-year retransmission consent agreements with charter communications, altice usa, mediacom communications, and google fiber. we also successfully completed the renewal of our abc affiliation for wggb in springfield, massachusetts.
beyond our operating group performance, we've had several notable recent accomplishments. we sold fansided in january. we recently reached an agreement on the sale of xumo and are waiting customary regulatory approvals before we close. with that, we will have sold all of our non-core assets acquired in the time inc transaction at very attractive multiples.
additionally, we raised our annual dividend last weekend for the 27th consecutive year. the new dividend reflects our continued confidence in the very strong cash flow generated by our viant brands and businesses. as we look ahead to our third quarter, we're encouraged by revenue trends in both operating groups. in the national media portfolio, we are currently pacing slightly up year-over-year incomparable advertising revenues.
in the local media group, we see stable advertising performance. while it's still early, non-political spot advertising is currently pacing up slightly in the third quarter compared to the prior year. we're also beginning to see more meaningful political-related advertising dollars for markets in presidential primary states. with that overview, i'll turn now to the review of our operating group performances beginning with our national media group.
fiscal 2020, national media group's second-quarter operating profit was $101 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $92 million, and adjusted ebitda was $141 million all records. fiscal 2020 national media group's second-quarter revenues were $597 million compared to $616 million in the prior-year period. as i mentioned, we made several changes to our portfolio that affected comparability with prior-year results, particularly as it relates to advertising and subscription revenues.
the portfolio rationalization is a key piece of our ongoing strategy to increase the profitability of our magazine business. since the time inc. acquisition, we've made a number of portfolio changes, including selling non-core assets at attractive multiples, investing in key brands to redesign, increase editorial sales resources and higher quality paper, introducing new products such as reveal, the magazine from the property brothers, drew and jonathan scott, transitioning marginally profitable titles to quarterly consumer-driven products with higher subscription and newsstand prices, merging competing titles to create more profitable brand with a broader reach, and closing down brands with very limited growth potential, specific portfolio changes affecting fiscal 2020 second-quarter results were transitioning coastal living and traditional home to premium newsstand titles, merging cooking light into meredith popular eatingwell title and closing the family circle money and martha stewart weddings magazines. looking more closely at fiscal 2020 second-quarter advertising performance compared to the prior-year period, total advertising-related revenues declined slightly due primarily to the portfolio changes.
comparable advertising-related revenues grew. many of our magazines delivered print advertising revenue growth, including people, our largest brand, which was up double digits. digital advertising revenue grew in the high-single digits driven by growth in traffic, impressions per visit, rates along with strong video performance. we're pleased to be delivering on the promise of our portfolio of industry-leading brands.
our performance is significantly stronger than the industry as a whole as leading to strong market share gains in print advertising. independent research continues to confirm the strength of our national media group portfolio across all media platforms. for example, a majority of advertisers identified meredith as a must buy, or complimentary buy across all of our key content categories of home, food, parenting, entertainment, and health. this is according to the most recent brand tracking study performed last month by the highly respected advertising perceptions.
importantly, we continue to serve more than 115 million american women with trusted content and provide advertisers with a safe environment in which to deliver their marketing messages. turning to fiscal 2020 second-quarter national media group consumer performance compared to prior-year period, total consumer-related revenues decline 10%. the change in revenue is due primarily to the portfolio changes, which impacted subscription and newsstand revenues. affinity marketing, licensing and digital and other consumer-related revenues rose 13%.
we are particularly pleased to have extended our long-running and successful brand licensing agreement with walmart during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 through the end of our fiscal 2024. in addition to the portfolio changes discussed a few moments ago, we've also completed or announced additional innovations in our national media group in fiscal 2020 to position it for revenue and profit growth over time. foremost is our newest brand launch reveal, a new lifestyle magazine done in partnership with globally recognized home renovation and interior design experts drew and jonathan scott who are stars of the popular property brothers television show. reveal is just one example of the way we are evolving the magazine model for some of our brands with the individual consumer in mind.
just last month, we announced the launch of a new quarterly magazine in partnership with best-selling author, restaurant tour and television host ayesha curry. we've also recently reimagined several of our brands including cooking light, coastal living and rachael ray in season as consumer-driven titles. what's common with all these titles is immersive photography, compelling content and high quality and beautiful paper that delivers a unique experience in media. we are aggressively innovating our digital products and services too.
this includes making strong progress on the investment initiatives highlighted in early september. as a reminder, these are building an integrated digital platform and strengthening our data and audience targeting tools. the new platform brings together the legacy narrative and timing digital assets to a common content management system, front end templates and a proprietary data insights platform. we expect the migration to this platform to be largely complete by the end of fiscal 2020.
we expect this new platform will offer a more personalized experience that drives engagement for our consumers at scale, richer audience insights, and contextual targeting for our advertising partners, and faster speeds and greater efficiency for us across our digital network. creating more video, the market for digital video-related advertising is expected to grow 30% faster than non-video display advertising and accounts for more than half of the total digital display ad spending in 2020 according to emarketer. we are seeing early and strong results from our video production work with video views and revenues across our owned and operated sites up in the double-digits in our fiscal second quarter. content to commerce, where we are integrating relevant commerce experiences into our brands to drive affiliate and consumer revenue.
we work with more than 400 retailers to drive premium high-quality leads and buyers to their online stores. other areas that drive digital engagement, one of these is through the recent acquisition of swearby, a small but interesting word of mouth recommendation engine that lets our consumers recommend products and experiences. we also acquired stop, breathe & think, a digital subscription-driven business in the fast-growing mindfulness space whose guided meditation program was named one of amazon alexa's top 10 skills of 2019. finally, we know that an increasing number of our consumers want hands free convenience for daily tasks.
so we're expanding our audience offerings in the fast-growing audio space, including ladies first, a new podcast from instyle that will highlight women who are providing hope and inspiration to other women. it takes a village, a new podcast from parents that will shine a light on the beauty and diversity of family life today, and people, which will be launching a new daily weekday podcast featuring the most compelling stories of the day across celebrity news, entertainment and human interest. to summarize the national media group discussion, it was a strong second quarter and first half, with progress on many fronts, and we're expecting a solid second half as well. now i'll turn it over to local media group president, patrick mccreery for an update on our television business.
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
thank you, tom. fiscal 2020 local media group's second-quarter operating profit was $55 million and adjusted ebitda was $67 million, revenues were $214 million. all were records for a non-political second quarter. looking more closely at fiscal 2020 second-quarter performance compared to the prior-year period.
non-political spot advertising revenues grew 2% to $90 million, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth. performance was led by growth in our las vegas and phoenix markets. from a category standpoint, the professional services, pharmaceutical, and home services categories were stronger, partially offset by softer results in the automotive category. digital advertising revenues across our local media group portfolio increased 23%.
third-party sales declined 5%. as expected in a non-political year, political advertising revenues were $4 million compared to $66 million in the prior-year period. consumer related revenues increased 15% to $85 million due to growth and retransmission fees from cable and satellite operators. these increases were partially offset by higher payments to affiliated networks.
we continue to pursue initiatives to strength and expand our local brands. our weekly television show based on the strength of the people brand continues to perform well with audiences and advertisers across our station group. we have committed to launching the show in daily syndication in the fall of 2020, beginning with distribution across all 12 of our local markets. we are actively engaged in discussions with other broadcast television owners to carry the show as well.
we're also seeing strong viewership for our whole -- our four-holiday specials we aired in the second quarter based on the southern living brand. we plan to begin airing the southern living show, a weekly show starting in april. it will run across the entire geographically diverse station portfolio. we're also pleased with the strength of our newsgathering and creative teams as evidenced by the 9 regional edward r.
murrow awards, as well as the 60 regional emmys recently earned by our colleagues. these efforts are helping our local media group maintain a strong connection to viewers, as demonstrated by our performance in the november ratings period when stations in 9 of our 12 markets ranked either number one or two from sign-on to sign-off. now i'll turn it over to joe ceryanec to conclude our call this morning with a look at companywide financial highlights and our third-quarter outlook.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, patrick, and good morning, everybody. you may recall that when we began fiscal 2020, we expected to generate $75 million in proceeds from the last of the non-core assets that we have put up for sale. as tom mentioned, we sold fansided last month and i'm pleased to tell you that once we receive hsr approval and close on the sale of xumo, we will have exceeded that initial target and we'll continue to expect to pay down a total of $150 million to $175 million of debt in fiscal 2020. we raised our dividend by 3.5% $2.38 on an annualized basis earlier this week, which marked the 27th straight year of dividend increases and 73rd consecutive year that meredith has paid dividends.
now turning to our outlook. for full-year fiscal 2020, we expect total company revenues to range from $3 billion to $3.2 billion, which is unchanged from our original guidance communicated last september. we expect earnings from continuing operations to range from $177 million to $192 million, and from $2.14 to $2.45 on a per-share basis, including a net after-tax charge for special items of $20 million. our actual results may include additional special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty.
we expect full-year fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda to range from $640 million to $675 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.75 to $6.20, also unchanged from our original guidance communicated last september. these ranges include approximately $50 million of previously announced planned strategic investments. now looking more closely at the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect national media group revenues to range from $515 million to $535 million, local media group revenues to range from $205 million to $215 million and earnings from continuing operations to range from $38 million to $45 million and from $0.39 to $0.55 on a per-share basis. we expect third-quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda to range from $145 million to $155 million and adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.24 to $1.40.
now, just to note, as we previously disclosed in last year's third quarter, it included a one-time out of period favorable adjustment to operating expenses of $10 million, the result of incorrect coding of certain magazine subscriptions by pre-acquisition time inc. absent these item are adjusted ebitda guidance for q3 as essentially even with our prior-year period. now, having delivered a very strong second quarter, we feel very good about our position as we head into the second half of the year. that said, it's very early in a new calendar year and we have limited visibility into 2020 national print and digital advertising budgets.
and in our local media group, we're seeing strength in political advertising demand, although again, it's very early in the election process. as a result, we're taking a cautiously optimistic approach, and not adjusting our annual guidance at this time. with that, i'll turn it back to tom to close and lead into q&a.
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thank you very much, joe. as you know, we manage our business over the long term. we continue to have confidence that we will deliver performance well within our stated ebitda range for the full year. while it is still early in calendar 2020, and we do not have clear visibility into advertising demand across both of our business -- businesses.
they are encouraging trends. first, we expect continued momentum in print advertising as we assess calendar 2020 budgets with our powerful portfolio brands. second, while we experience quarterly swings, we expect to deliver at least mid-single-digit growth and national media group digital advertising revenues, driven in part by strong video related performance. in our local media group, we're seeing a pickup in political primary advertising dollars in the back half of our fiscal 2020.
and finally, we expect to renew mvpd contracts representing approximately 30% of our subscriber base in the second half of fiscal 2020. now we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have for us this morning.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of dan kurnos from benchmark. your line is open.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. good to see a good print here guys.
a couple of questions. maybe for patrick and tom. starting off on the local side. first, on political.
is there any way-obviously presidential is not huge for you guys as part of your footprint but is there any way to quantify the impact the bloomberg is having and what kind of variability there is in terms of your political forecast. and then on the retrend side, numbers are little bit better than anticipated. i think you've got at&t in the back half of this year, which has been a little noisy and obviously comcast had a bit of a soft sub guide. so just kind of your thoughts on rate versus subs and how kind of the market shaping up in the back half of the year?
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
thanks, dan. good morning. i would say that on the political side, we booked $7 million in the first half of fiscal '20. and that's double the comparable quarter from '16.
so i think things that shows the variability as positive. bloomberg is certainly having an impact across most of our footprint. as you mentioned presidential is life for us typically if the headlines are to be believed he's going to double the spending and that will be beneficial certainly. so that's another cautiously optimistic opportunity for us.
with regard to retransmission, you're exactly right we have at&t in the back half of this fiscal. there has been some noise around that. we're confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement with them. and as far as the sub-base i think, we've all adjusted to the reality of subs are declining at about 3% annually, and we've accounted for that in our calculations in our negotiations.
so we're confident that we can continue to grow net profit contribution from retransmission through that process.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
and then on the national side, just -- tom with the -- you talked about portfolio rationalization for a while now, you're obviously-i think it's-you probably pulled off maybe a point and a half a margin upside in the quarter. i'm just curious if you can kind of outlay sort of your thoughts on the delta here or at least break it down between what came from margin improvement from portfolio rationalization versus say better cost controls overall all on your side versus kind of the upside, and then the impact of the new platform that you're rolling out if there's any way to sort of quantify, sort of the combination of those things, as you see it in the back half of the year contributing to margin upside, at least directionally that would be kind of helpful?
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i think, dan, i think it's a difficult question to kind of break out all the detail of the margin game, but it's a combination of a lot of different things right. so, there's some-actually there's some great mix changes on our digital business where we're starting to see that video investment kick in and video cpms are the highest that we have. and as we've mentioned before, we just don't have enough inventory and that's why we've been leaning and investing in that area. so for the first half of our fiscal year, total video impressions are up in high 20% gains year over year.
and revenue is up over 30% year over year, to give you an example. on the magazine side, again for you guys, there's a lot of comparability issues when we do things like this, but it's the right thing that we do going forward. if we have brands that we think are actually losing money and not going to be a growth factor going forward, we actually shut them down and an example that would be family circle or where we've taken two brands and combine them in a cooking light eatingwell. so all of that improves our margins year over year.
and then again, when we look at costs, we are still benefiting somewhat in the first half of the year from some synergy capture that we've had. that's going to start running out now after we've been through this for two full years. but we did have some synergy capture on the cost side in the first half of the year in the national media group. 
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company -- analyst
all right. super helpful color and nice to see an old meredith print. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of kyle evans from stephen. your line is open.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. first one, i have a couple here on the nmg side. how should we phase that 30% renewal over the two quarters in the second half of '20?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
the 30% is at at&t, kyle and that is going to be in the fourth quarter. i think it's in may. it is in may.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. i'm hearing kind of growing excitement around the friction that's coming out of national core through some industry efforts. is that -- is it possible that that piece of the business, which is kind of been a drag for several years now on core, that that could turn into growth going forward, and then i've got another follow up there on tv?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah. it could. if you look at the second quarter, our national advertising was up eight. so i think we're seeing positive pace for this quarter in national as well.
so it's nice to see it come back. i'm not going to get the firm on it, but we're cautiously optimistic that it will continue.
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
and we're currently pacing kyle up a little bit in q3.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
gotcha, patrick. well, i've got you. kind of an updated contribution number for auto and maybe not necessarily like a pacing for three 3q, but you can give me that if you like, but kind of a longer-term view maybe at 12 to 24-month view on your market?
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
yeah, i mean, in second quarter, automotive was down eight. and i think that's the trend that we've seen for the last six or so quarters. we don't look for that to reverse anytime soon. if you look at automotive sales numbers, they've been about 17 million flat for the last three years.
in q3, it's a little bit better. it's currently pacing minus six. so we're seeing some steady improvement. and that's why on the local side as the manufacturer money tends to disappear and the tier 2 dealer money tends to disappear, we're actually really chasing the local ad dollars for automotive because we think they're going to need to spend more.
as a reminder professional service is in this quarter outperformed automotive, it was a total of 25% of our take and automotive was 23. so that, again, has been a three-quarter trend and we don't look for that to change.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. moving on to the nmg piece of the business. i'm trying to reconcile the readership up 4% with the consumer down 10%. and i know we've talked a little bit in the past about some potential subscriber issues in the time base, maybe just help reconciling those two numbers and an update on the progress you're making there with those subscribers?
patrick mccreery -- local media group president
yeah, so audience number, the syndicated audience number that's in the print world, it's called mri. it's kind of like nielsen television ratings. so that's a syndicated audience. they go out, they measure brands, they have a panel of people that they go out, and they ask if you're reading the readership, you have pass-along readership and things like that.so it never kind of matches what we deliver from the number of copies and the number of subscribers that we have.
so there's a little offset between that being actually up versus what we're quoting as the actual revenue over subscribers being down. so when we actually in the example of family circle, you had and joe might have the revenue associated with family circle on an annual basis but that's a brand portfolio that was decreasing over time, we've had other brands that are stronger from both the consumer and from an advertising perspective. so we make the difficult decision to close it down because it's an ebitda drag on us, but it does have not insignificant consumer revenue associated with that. so that's what actually causes the decrease when we do that.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, it was about $2 million -- follow up in your question kyle, the biggest change in sub-revenue is again due to the portfolio changes. so for example, as tom mentioned, family circle was down about $2 million in q2 from a sub-perspective. and we expect the revenue to be down about six million in q3 and about six million in q4 due to the reduction or due to the shutdown of the magazine.
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
when we -- when we look at consumer demand for magazines and we've always said we're in the -- we're not in the news business, we're not in content that that has to be produced and consumed immediately. we're in the inspiration business. so when you look at women, our consumer demand for our magazines has been basically flat for a long period of time, and we're actually looking for that to the future.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. lastly on an nmg maybe just a quick update on where you are in terms of allocating the 50 million in strategic investments, any kind of early returns you're seeing there. and then thank you for the impressions and the revenue growth on video, could you size that for us and kind of squint and look into the future, and guess and what you think the contribution of video could be on a --
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. i think i know, the video example that i gave was, listen, a big part of what we said from the beginning was that we're going to be investing in video and more video content. and as i said, it's great to see, you know roughly 30% growth in the first half of the fiscal year. you want to make sure that you're doing it profitably and creating content that will generate a lot of impressions.
the other big area of investment, as i mentioned, was getting us onto one platform. and that's really, capital for engineers to actually get us all programmed and onto the same platform. and that will be-we're about 60% today of our brands and traffic are on this unified platform. and again by june will be 100% on, and again from when i look at total impressions.
so just give you an example of total impressions on our digital for the first half of the fiscal year, total impressions were up 16% and total sessions were up about 4%. so very, very strong growth and when we can get that traffic then that single unified platform allows us to take that data and drive higher cpm and be more efficient to do that. so we're very excited about getting that done. but that's been the vast majority of our investments been the digital platform and also video. 
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
ok.  [operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of davis herbert from wells fargo. your line is open.
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. just a couple for me, first what is your leverage at quarter and if you could talk about forward-looking leverage given the political inflow we should see later this year?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
hey, davis, it's joe. our leverage at the end of december i believe was around three and a half times. as we look to the end of the year at june 30th, we expect that to be down about three-two.
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
 three-two at june 30, 2020.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yup.
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and would you expect and -- you don't have to give a number, but would you expect that number to migrate lower i guess with political dollars for the calendar year 2020 as well?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yes, for sure. the focus is continuing to pay down debt. and with political coming in and the first half of 2021 we'll continue to aggressively pay down debt. and, we will expect in 2021 with political, that would help the ebitda side of the equation as well.
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. ok. and then second question from me is, now that the time integration is largely through as you said. how do you think about visibility for that segment going forward? i know you've already talked a bit about a lot of the investments you're making in video but do you think the visibility piece will improve in the next 12 months?
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
what do you -- what do you -- i'm sorry what do you mean by visibility segment as well?
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
on the national media segment, sorry. especially for on the advertising side now that you've closed some of the publishing titles how do you think about visibility?
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, i think as we work through these changes i mean, the first year we had a lot of these brands that we were treating as held-for-sale that have sold and that really affected the visibility, over the last year. now with the portfolio changes again, which was part of the plan, that is affecting the visibility. as we look going forward, one of the things we're looking to doing is doing some more reconciliation on a like-for-like or same-store sales to help maybe bring the word comparability into a little more focus to help you guys.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yes, i mean we've talked about from the-variable on advertising, our longer-term hypothesis and thesis has been, print on a comparable basis down in the mid-single-digit range, and digital growth up the mid-single-digit. so if you looked at when i mentioned again, on a comparable basis if you look at the trailing prior four quarters or calendar year 2019 as a whole, we were actually up slightly in total advertising and just slightly over $1 billion in advertising, and print was down just a hair short of minus 5% and digital was plus 8%. so again, right in what we are talking about. and then as we lookout, you have quarter swings, we're actually in q4, print advertising was actually up on a comparable basis.
and then, as we look out to q3, we're back looking at kind of down mid-single-digits in print, and an up mid-single-digits in digital, but longer-term kind of year over year that's kind of our look at. and we're going to do our job to kind of explain that variability as we've kind of managed the portfolio and make sure that you can get into the financials and see the comparability.
davis herbert -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, that's very helpful. thank you so much, and best of luck, joe, on retirement. thanks.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
appreciate it. thank you.
tom harty -- president, chief executive officer, and director
great, so that concludes our call today. we appreciate everyone's time this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. thank you very much.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the meredith fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings conference.
[operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference call over to your speaker for today, mr. mike lovell. sir, you may begin.
mike lovell -- investor relations director
good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. our call will begin with comments from chairman and chief executive officer, tom harty; followed by chief financial officer, jason frierott. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from our forecasts. reasons for the differences are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in our sec filings. certain financial measures that we are discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our slide presentation. our earnings release and slide presentation are available in the investor relations section of meredith.com. an archive of our prepared comments will be available on our website later today.
and now, i'll turn the call over to tom.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, mike, and good morning, everyone. i hope you've had the chance to see our news release and our related slide presentation issued earlier this morning. they include disclosures we think you'll find very useful.
i'll start with slide 3. our audiences continue to count on meredith's trusted brands and our advertisers are responding in kind. as a result, we delivered record revenue and adjusted ebitda performance in our fiscal 2021 second quarter, even as the covid pandemic continues to impact certain aspects of our business. to summarize, ebitda growth for each of our segments was driven by strong gains in the national media group digital advertising and the local media group political advertising revenues, which more than offset adverse covid-related impacts. we had the best second quarter free cash flow performance in our history and finished the quarter with more than $375 million of cash in the bank. this performance has enabled us to continue strengthening our liquidity and reducing our net debt.
as we've discussed in the past, the strategy we're pursuing has two facets. the first, net debt reduction is our number one priority. our leverage ratio target is 2 times adjusted ebitda over the long-term. we're making great progress with improvement in our leverage ratio compared to september 30.
second, we will continue strengthening and enhancing our digital and consumer focus capabilities. we reached a critical milestone in the quarter, as digital advertising revenues surpassed magazine for the first time, and our licensing and digital consumer businesses reached record highs. meanwhile, consumer engagement remains strong. response rates to our magazine subscription solicitations remain above historic norms, and traffic to our national media group sites is expanding. national media group consumer-related revenues account for nearly 50% of the segment, and we are leaning aggressively into growing licensing and e-commerce opportunities. we believe we have a strong opportunity for growth ahead.
with that, let's go into detail of the quarter. starting with the digital side of the national media group, our team delivered outstanding performance. digital advertising revenues grew 22% to a record high $161 [$161.2] million. our multi-year efforts to bring all of our brands together on a single digital platform continues to enable strong consumer engagement, along with growth in advertising and e-commerce revenues.
of note, traffic to our digital properties and partner networks grew significantly, with 16% session growth from the prior year period. our fiscal second quarter, which includes several holidays, is heavily influenced by food. allrecipes, the world's largest digital food site, as ranked by comscore, delivered record performance, with almost 0.5 billion sessions, up 23% from the prior period. people.com also delivered record performance and remains the number one destination in the entertainment category. additionally, our powerful national media group brands, led by people and better homes and gardens, delivered strong growth in brand licensing revenues, particularly from our digital relationship with apple news plus, along with continued growth from our longtime licensing partner, walmart.
our performance is driven by our trusted brands, relevant content, consumer experiences at scale, digital first-party data, and unique offerings for our partners. we're seeing significant demand from the capabilities offered by our meredith data studio, which we launched last quarter. our clients are seeing value from it across a broad range of offerings, including predictive insights that help our brands and our partners create the right content and messaging for consumers, robust data-driven audience targeting for our partners, and leveraging our taxonomy that is unique in the industry, and predictive advertising solutions based on our contextual data that's driven click the card experiences.
as a result of our unique and robust suite of offerings, we sold twice as many million dollar plus programs during the second quarter compared to last year. as our digital business continues to grow, we expect to provide additional disclosures in an effort to provide more transparency. we've already heard from many of you about this and continue to welcome feedback on digital-related disclosures that would be helpful to better understand our business results.
turning to our national media group magazine business, we're encouraged by our continued recovery in magazine advertising and delivered sequential improvement from the prior quarter. as you may recall, at the pandemic start, we put together a plan to maximize performance during the crisis. it included differentiating ourselves by maintaining publishing frequencies and schedules, which has contributed to meredith gaining nearly 5 points of market share in the last year. we continue to see strength in magazine subscription solicitation, direct mail response rates were up 50% in the spring, 38% in the summer, and 35% in the fall. online sales at magazine.store are up for 39 weeks of the last 41 weeks and a 40% year-over-year. these strong response rates form the basis for a long-term relationship with our customers. subscribers we source ourselves, we knew at higher rates than agent sources, allowing us to grow the profit contribution from our subscription activities over the long-term as rates step up over time.
looking more closely at our broadcasting portfolio, we delivered record political advertising results in the second quarter, competitive races, particularly those in our phoenix and atlanta media markets, drove nearly 100% growth versus two years ago. our local digital efforts have gained significant traction and are giving us a platform to capture digital political growth. our team delivered $12 million of digital political advertising revenues in the quarter compared to less than $1 million two years ago. nonpolitical advertising was clearly impacted by political crowd-out, while still improving sequentially versus the prior quarter.
turning to slide 4. we have more than 40 brands in our portfolio and we continue to develop new opportunities for growth. for example, we announced last month, a strategic relationship with wyndham destinations, that includes the sale of the travel and leisure brand for $100 million in cash and a commitment for $30 million in marketing spend across our portfolio over the next five years. we received $55 million in cash in fiscal '21 and the balance over the next three years. our agreement also grants meredith a 30-year renewable royalty free license to continue operating travel and leisure's media assets. so we expect little change for our p&l going forward.
we're expanding our brands to new media platforms, including broadcast television. a great example is our recent launch of the people show, which debuted in september 2020 across our 12 markets and remains the number one new show the season, according to the most recent nielsen ratings in december 2020. television is a natural extension for the people brand, and this shows ratings are compelling. as a reminder, we are working with sony pictures television to syndicate the show to non-meredith stations beginning in the fall of 2022.
in the third column, we are pursuing consumer-driven opportunities, including e-commerce. as an example, our content commerce team drove a four-fold increase in partner retail sales during amazon's prime day, through solid execution of cost and editorial and promotion across our sites. weeks later, we delivered similarly strong performance during the black friday, cyber monday weekend retail event.
finally, we're launching new products, including podcasts and more video. video views across our owned and operated properties and network partners grew 17% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the prior-year period. we've doubled the number of our brands creating podcast in the last year, and podcast production is up nearly 30% from a year-ago. while the macro economic backdrop is still uncertain, we're excited about our performance in the first half of fiscal 2021, and the groundwork we've laid for future growth.
with that overview, i'll turn it over to jason. i'll come back to highlight certain trends we're seeing in our third quarter and offer closing comments, then we'll invite your questions.
jason m. frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom. i'll begin on slide 5. looking at the second quarter 2021 consolidated performance, revenues were $902 million, up 11% from the prior-year period. adjusting for portfolio changes announced over the last year, total revenues would have been up 14% on a comparable basis. with the second quarter complete, we have now cycled through these portfolio changes, as the last actions taken happened in the second quarter of 2020. advertising-related revenues were $525 [$525.1]million, 23% higher than the prior-year period. on a comparable basis, excluding $10 million of portfolio changes, advertising-related revenues were up 26%. as tom said, growth was led by a record political advertising across our station group and record digital advertising across our national media sites.
that said, covid continues to impact our results, particularly in our legacy magazine and nonpolitical advertising channels. as we continue to progress through the pandemic, quantifying the precise impact has become more challenging. our estimate of the covid-related revenue impact to advertising consumer-related and other activities for the second quarter totaled between $25 million and $35 million, with the majority of declines in the national media group.
consumer-related revenues were $358 million, up 3% from the prior-year period. on a comparable basis, excluding $8 million of portfolio changes, consumer-related revenues were up 5%, driven by licensing and retransmission growth. other revenue, was $18 [$18.4] million, down 46% from the prior-year period. this was primarily the result of non-repeat project work and sunsetting service agreements for sold brands, including time, sports illustrated, and fortune.
on a consolidated level, adjusted ebitda grew 57% to $304 [$304.4] million from the prior-year period. growth was driven by $130 million of political advertising revenues, including $118 million of political spot and $12 million of digital advertising revenues, along with 22% growth in national media group digital advertising revenues.
fiscal 2021 second quarter free cash flow was $174 million, a $107 million better than the prior-year period, as we benefited from digital and political advertising revenues, lower employee-related items and lower restructuring payments.
turning to the next page, on slide 6. national media group revenues were $576 million, down 4% from the prior-year period. the portfolio changes i mentioned earlier accounted for $18 million of the decline, with consumer and advertising generally impacted equally. on a comparable basis, excluding portfolio changes, national media group revenues were down 1%. advertising-related revenues were $295 [$295.4] million, down 2% from the prior-year period. adjusting for portfolio changes, advertising-related revenues were up 1%, that includes comparable digital advertising growth of 22% or $29 million, which more than offset comparable magazine declines of $19 million, a critical milestone for the company.
as the covid recovery continues, and due to seasonality of our advertising businesses, we don't expect this transition between digital and magazine advertising to happen every quarter in the immediate term, but we continue progressing toward a more permanent portfolio shift.
giving some more color on our advertising performance during the quarter, we are benefiting from our multi-year investment in the technology platform we highlighted last quarter. as a reminder, the new platform brings together consumer profiles, real-time insights and intent signals to; one, predict trends that inform our editorial and products road map; two, provide personalized experiences to our consumers; and three, give our advertisers the ability to tailor the right messages and products to the users most likely to buy at any given time. it also prepares us well for a world where third party cookies are no longer supported. the magazine platform is recovering in line with our expectations. here too, clients are looking for dependability, flexibility and brand safety. as a result, our magazine brands are outperforming the competitive set and continue to take market share. according to media radar, meredith's share of the u.s. magazine advertising market stood at more than 45% in calendar 2020 through december, up from 31% in the same period a year-ago.
national media group consumer-related revenues were up 1% from the prior-year period. adjusting for portfolio changes, consumer-related revenues grew 4%. subscription revenues were down 5% on a comparable basis, primarily due to our efforts to shift our subscription solicitation mix toward direct to publisher and away from third-party agents. as a reminder, the strategy reduces revenue but increases profitability over time, and our rate base remained stable at 36 million. newsstand revenues grew $3 million. despite the challenging environment, which continues to impact certain retail channels, including airports and bookstores, we saw our opportunities based on current events and published more special interest titles compared to the prior-year period. our licensing and digital consumer activities, which includes e-commerce, lead generation and content commerce continue to deliver strong growth, up 34% in the quarter from the prior-year period.
other revenues were $47 million, down 34%, primarily the result of non-repeat project work and sunsetting service agreements for sold brands. adjusted ebitda was $156 million, up 11%, despite continued impact from covid, compared to the prior-year period. the driving factor was digital revenue, which reached a milestone of surpassing magazine advertising revenue in the second quarter and helped deliver margin expansion for the national media group.
similar to our discussion last quarter and consistent with our goal to expand disclosures related to our digital business, let me walk you through a few digital kpis on the right side of the page. digital sessions were up 16% from the prior-year period. allrecipes delivered the strongest year-over-year traffic growth, as consumers visiting the site for holiday-related food inspiration. this performance was followed by people.com, which continues to benefit from strong interest in celebrity and entertainment-related information. we saw more advertisers coming back into the open programmatic market, which helped increased programmatic pricing. importantly, we also saw strong growth in direct sales, driven by advertiser demand for our powerful brands, premium content, and first-party data, along with the flexibility that our digital platform offers. looking beyond the advertising at the bottom right of the page, our licensing and e-commerce activities continue to gain traction, led by relationships, including those with walmart and amazon.
turning to slide 7. local media group revenues were $328 [$328.4] million, up 53%, political spot advertising revenues of $118 million, retransmission revenues of $92 million, and third- party digital political advertising revenues of $12 million, offset a 16% decline in nonpolitical spot advertising revenues, driven by crowd-out from political demand. we estimate crowd-out from political spot advertising revenues, lowered second quarter nonpolitical spot advertising revenues by approximately 14 points to 16 points. adjusted ebitda more than doubled to $161 million, driven primarily by political demand.
looking more closely at political advertising, the map on the right side shows where we delivered the most revenue by market, as depicted by the size of the shaded circle. in the second quarter, political advertising revenues were up 96% from the prior election cycle two years ago. approximately 60% of second quarter revenues came from the senate races in arizona and in georgia, where we also benefited from run-off races in the u.s. senate.
finally, as tom mentioned, our digital efforts extend to our local media group, where our local digital team has expanded beyond nonpolitical and captured $12 million of third-party digital political advertising revenues in the quarter. this compares to less than $1 million during the last election cycle two years ago. this highlight can be found in our segment schedule within the local media group third-party advertising revenue line.
turning to slide 8. cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet strength remain critically important to meredith. net debt reduction is our number one priority and we continue to target a leverage ratio of 2 times adjusted ebitda over the long-term. as a company, one of our key performance measures is free cash flow, and we generated $174 [$174.3] million in free cash flow in the second quarter. it was the most free cash flow generated during the second fiscal quarter in our company's 119-year history, and compares to $67 million in the prior-year period. this improvement was primarily driven by our strong political advertising and digital performance, lower employee-related items and lower restructuring payments. as a result of our cash and adjusted ebitda performance, our leverage ratio on a reported basis, was 3.9 times adjusted ebitda, as of december 31, 2020, a significant improvement from the prior quarter.
looking at the bottom of the slide, we ended the second quarter of 2021 with $379 million of cash in the bank compared to $21 million in the prior-year period. our revolver balance was zero at december 31, and continues to be unused. we continue to see positive momentum in our efforts to improve cash flow, helped by strong digital and political advertising demand. we had approximately $450 million of cash in the bank as of january 31, 2021, and we expect to continue generating positive free cash flow each quarter throughout fiscal 2021.
now, i'll turn it back to tom for closing thoughts, on slide 9.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, jason. our consumers today continue to focus on food, home, health, entertainment, and news and information about their local communities. these subjects are the cornerstone of the meredith corporation. as we think about our priorities today, i want to leave you with four key thoughts.
first, our number one priority is debt reduction. our goal is to reduce our net debt to a leverage ratio of 2 times, and we're making progress with approximately $450 million of cash in the bank at january 31.
second, we're excited at our digital advertising and consumer revenue growth. this includes achieving a critical milestone with digital advertising revenues surpassing magazine advertising revenue for the first time in our history. we attribute this success to several factors, including investments in our national media group digital platform, our deep first party data and analytics capabilities, and our powerful brands, which include people, allrecipes, better homes and gardens, and southern living. these brands are backed by a tremendous creative engine and collectively reach an engaged nearly 95% of american women, more women than any other media portfolio in the united states. together, these assets and capabilities are meredith's differentiators and form the basis of our value proposition to advertisers and shareholders. they also position us to benefit from incremental advertising spend as the economy recovers.
third, nonpolitical spot and magazine advertising are recovering at a measured pace, and we expect continued improvement over time. finally, our advertising and marketing partners are expressing optimism for calendar 2021, citing the expected passage of further economic stimulus legislation and large-scale deployment of covid-19 vaccines. that said, near-term uncertainty caused by the unstable political environment and persistently high cases of nationwide, are contributing to a slower start to advertising spending in the march quarter. this is particularly true for magazine advertising, including our luxury and travel related brands.
as we look into our fiscal 2021 third quarter, compared to the prior year period, assuming no changes in trajectory due to covid or other macro factors, we expect national media group digital advertising revenues up in the mid-teens. magazine advertising revenues down in the high-teens. local media group nonpolitical spot advertising revenues to be approximately flat. and we expect costs in the third and fourth quarter to return to the normal run-rates.
in closing, we're excited by our performance in the first half of fiscal 2021. we're cautious as we look into the second half of fiscal 2021, as there continues to be significant variables at play. to reiterate, our goals are to reduce debt and continue to strengthen and enhance our digital and consumer growth opportunities.
with that, we'll open it up to your questions.

operator instructions] at this time, i would like to turn the call over to tom harty.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
good morning, everyone. joining jason and myself this morning, we have patrick mccreery, the president of the local media group. we also have catherine levene, the president of the national media group. and since our last earnings call, catherine was promoted into a leadership position of the national media group, where she previously ran our digital business. so we're thrilled to have catherine in this leadership position and joining us today. now we're happy to take your first question.
operator
your first question comes from the line of john janedis with wolfe research.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, thanks, tom. you guys, you talked about your direct marketing response rates. how do you see those trending as you comp at the start of the pandemic? and and how you're thinking about it retention relative to historical levels? and then maybe quickly on your comments related to magazine advertising. in terms of the outlook, is that to all it down high-teens? is that broad-based or is that still confined to some of the categories you talked to you on prior calls? thank you.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
great, john. yeah, so one insight that we found through the pandemic, consumer insight. i think it probably took us most by surprise, was the response rates to magazine. so consumer demand for magazine solicitations shot up on day one of the pandemic. and as i mentioned, we had a 50% lift in direct response rates in the spring and close to 40% for the balance of the year. but those trends continue. there is something i think -- when we look at women, they're doing both, they're looking at digital, they're looking at magazines. and there is something about the magazine format in the pandemic, and the content that we deliver that's spiking that demand. so we're taking advantage of it. and actually jason has been leaning in and giving the team more investment dollars.
so as we talked about in the past, more direct to publisher or deals that we have ourselves with consumers. in the long run, when you look at consumer lifetime value, it's a great, great thing for us. so we see that trend continue and we're excited about it.
when you look at advertising, where we've been most hurt through the pandemic, is obviously, been in our travel and luxury brands. so some of those have been down and continue to be down, over 50% year-over-year. so we're seeing that trend continue. so when you say -- when we look at the whole portfolio, some of our brands are performing closer to flat, in some instances actually up. and then we have others, like luxury and travel that are down significantly. so it's a little bit of a tale of two cities depending on the brand and the category. but we're excited to see as the covid vaccines come out, we expect all of that travel advertising to come back and we're prepared for it.
so again, we don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but we're cautiously optimistic as we look to the future at some of those categories that have been highly impacted by covid-19.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thanks. maybe one last one. on your comment on costs moving to a normal run-rate going forward, are there specific areas to call out [indecipherable] investment? and what does normalized cost levels actually mean?
jason m. frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, as we look at kind of cost levels pre-pandemic, that's -- i think that's what that's really referring to, john. i think the -- as you think about our cost levels in the third and fourth quarter last year, i think were low for reasons that we've talked about before, specifically in employee-related costs. we've talked about kind of the one-time salary actions that we've taken. we talked about in terms of benefits and healthcare costs. people weren't going to doctors, those types of things. and now that's kind of come back to a more normal run-rate. so those types of costs that were employee-related nature i think would be the highlights that i would give you there.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right, thanks a lot, guys.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, john.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dan kurnos with benchmark.
daniel kurnos -- the benchmark co -- analyst
yeah, good morning. first off, congratulations [indecipherable] and well deserved. just, tom and maybe even catherine here, i guess, we've been hearing a lot, obviously, just kind of out of tie-ins that's something that john just asked on your tail end remarks here, tom, just around the impacted mobility here, obviously digital, based on your initial expectations when we started the quarter and then where they finished even much better. we've had an unfortunate resurgence of covid, which continues to appear in q1 here. and i just wanted to get a sense from you guys how you're thinking about the sustainability of the growth year given all of the changes you've made, clearly you guys are benefiting from trends, but also a lot of internal investments to the extent that you have kind of any visibility here in terms of the digital outlook? and how long the sustained level of [indecipherable] traffic revenue year-over-year growth, given that is pacing above what i think kind of your long-term targets are, that would be super helpful to start? thanks.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
sure. i'll ask catherine to pile on. but just to begin. i think that our guidance for advertising for digital in q3, up mid-teens kind of shows the strength of what we're looking for in q3. so we believe we've got a long runway or growth from an advertising perspective. but also i want to make sure that you're focusing in on some of our other digital growth, specifically related to consumer. so i'd like catherine to make some comments about what we're seeing in our licensing area and our e-commerce area, and those investments that we've made over the last five years are really starting to pay dividends. so maybe catherine can give some observations about advertising, but also focusing on consumers.
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
sure. so let me just start with advertising. i think you know was, obviously, our session growth has been strong and expense sustained. we -- i think as people go back to the office and life opens up, traffic may may not be at the same growth rate as it's been through covid. on the other hand, open programmatic is only a third of the driver of growth in the digital business. and every demand channel we saw growth. so that includes our direct sales and premium programmatic, that's our large sponsorships. that was up 22%. video is up significantly. audio is up significantly. digital consumer, as tom said, is up significantly as our -- and we signed twice as many million dollar plus partnership.
so in the advertising categories, every channel, direct and premium programmatic, which are sold by our sales force and really driven by our competitive advantage, that's noted throughout any [phonetic] platform, our relationship with consumers and our ability to target really specific messages. that's growing equally to our open programmatic session growth. so that's the first part in video -- i mean, sorry, in advertising.
in consumer, we're seeing even stronger growth, and may be hard to see in some of our numbers. but the e-commerce portion of our consumer digital revenue is up in the mid '60s, right. so we're talking about affiliate commerce, marketplace, promotions, etc. that's growing significantly and we expect that to be sustained at those rates moving forward. now, you can see that in some of our prime day numbers that tom talked about, black friday. but it's ongoing throughout the quarter.
the other area we see and we expect to be moving into are paid products. we're still in the early part of our thinking around paid products in our strategy, but we are developing new products and services that consumers will ultimately pay for it. so we see a lot of opportunity in the content, commerce and consumer revenue categories of our business, on top of the advertising.
daniel kurnos -- the benchmark co -- analyst
yeah, i mean, i was going to ask that next, i just didn't want to put it all in one question. but yeah, catherine, can you dig a little bit more into that? i know this is a question i asked on the last call, just around, kind of e-com and licensing opportunities. obviously, you have had a very strong bhg relationship with walmart, it feels like there's increasing allrecipes opportunities. i'm just curious, are you driving a lot of your revenues through affiliates or amazon? are there opportunities to get more incremental brands into the marketplace? how much -- how heavier you're leaning into those areas? and what i mean, big growth rates off of slightly smaller numbers, but is over time over the next, i don't know, three to five years. how big a piece of the business do you think kind of those components will to get to?
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
yeah, i'll start off on the last, catherine. i think that our licensing business grew by just over 40% in the quarter. and to your point, that is two main drivers of that. and one of them is apple news plus. so that's our relationship with apple, where we have our premium content in a paid environment in apple news and we get paid a royalty on that, and that's been growing significantly. and then, walmart continues with the better homes and gardens brand to grow. through the pandemic, it's up in the over 10% kind of consistently, and so we've seen nice growth through this period of time and. and that's been a long-term relationship that we've been growing kind of year-over-year. so, licensing, i'll ask catherine to get a little bit more detail about the digital consumer area and make some comments. but again, it's not just about advertising. our strategy from a digital perspective is to grow consumer revenues on products and services, and some of that is going to be licensing, some of that's going to be direct products that we sell to the consumers, some of it's going to be affiliate deals. but a significant area of growth that we see going forward. i don't know catherine if you have any other comments in that area.
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
i think that's exactly right. i'm happy to answer any other questions as well.
daniel kurnos -- the benchmark co -- analyst
no, that's fine. i appreciate the incremental the color. anyway, thanks for the clarity, guys. congrats on the quarter. and make sure you put the money in the bank [indecipherable]
operator
your next question comes from the line of jason bazinet with citi.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
can i just ask a follow-up on that $10 million nominally your licensing growth. i think the thing that everyone's probably trying to figure out is how much of that sort of how this will be of the growth, sort of how's this secular tailwinds that could continue like apple news plus as opposed to commerce driven, right, which will obviously be a bit more bumpy up and down versus the holiday season versus a normal quarter? is it sort of like 20% of the growth is apple news and the other part is commerce-related? something like that.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
we could dig out the numbers. i'll ask jason to see if we have the numbers on that. i don't have it off the top of my head. but i think, what i would say about apple news plus, jason is that, it's really not related to anything related to covid. this was a long-term deal that we cut with them and we have escalators related to -- year-over-year escalators related to the deal, related to our content performance within apple news plus. so it's really on time spent with our brands. so this is something, a lot of this growth even pre-covid we were anticipating and see that kind of continuing to grow as we go forward. so really not related to covid. i don't know if we have the exact numbers we can break down.
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
i can tell you that. that over half of that business is our e-commerce business, which is our affiliate business, and that's the business that i said was growing in the high '60s this past quarter and we see that continuing. so we are in fact investing more in that area of affiliate commerce. though, i don't see that slowing down in the near-term.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
even sequentially.
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
year-over-year.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
year-over-year. okay. that's what we're trying. okay, perfect. thank you.
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
yeah, year-over-year.
jason m. frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, obviously. there is some seasonality associated with that, jason. when like -- there is a lot of commerce activity that happens that's has been talked about with amazon prime day and things like that as well.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
yeah, totally get it. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of kyle evans with stephens.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
good morning, kyle.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
catherine, congratulations. you talked a lot about in and kind of the unit volume trends on the digital side. what is the contribution of video to national digital? and where do you think that settles over time?
catherine levene -- president and chief digital officer
yeah. so video is still a fairly small portion of total video advertising revenue, which in some ways is the good news and the bad news. the good news is that we have a lot of runway in video. so we've done -- we're starting to invest more and more, i think we talked last year about investments in video. we weren't able to use all of that money in this past year because of covid, but we expect to be leaning in heavily into video. and in fact, we just hired a new chief digital content officer, who came from pacemate [phonetic] if you're familiar with pacemate. we reached hundreds of millions of users each month in video, and she is the head of content there. so we just brought her over to bring her expertise across all of digital editorial, but to remain heavily into video.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
great. i'll switch over to patrick. you've been neglected, patrick. if i heard jason correctly, your estimate on political crowd-out would almost completely negate the year-over-year decline in nonpolitical spot tv ads. first off, did i hear that right? and that -- which would mean we were kind of flattish ex-political. and then, how do we get there? i mean, this is a business that was waylaid in march and was down massively, kind of where are the pockets of strength that are getting us back to flattish core.
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
yeah. no, you did hear correctly. and for those stations of ours that were not heavy in political, that's exactly what we saw, flattish. i think -- but we've seen strong growth in professional services quarter-over-quarter, and we've even seen strong growth quarter-over-quarter in auto. i mean, look, retail and restaurants are still really challenged, no doubt about it. there is a level of uncertainty there, but we are seeing continued sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. so i mean, really, that's -- i think there's also a lot of frankly pent-up demand out there, right, for these businesses that would like to grow and need a way to do that.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
and kyle, i'm just piling on with patrick too. the portfolio, it's not -- we have a different portfolio with different performance by market to. so we have some markets like las vegas and portland that have obviously been more affected by covid and some of the political unrest that's been happening in those markets. so that's what you would expect to see some recovery as we get through this crisis.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
patrick. i'm not asking you to guide. but how should we think about kind of annualizing the pandemic pressures that hit us last march and the reverse political displacement kind of in the second half of calendar ' 21? i mean, what are the -- i'm having trouble thinking core over the next four quarters?
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
yeah, well, look. i think that -- i'm looking forward to this quarter because i've got the super bowl on cbs, and that's a nice -- that's a nice bump. and then, we're up against not having the ncaa tournament last march and april, which are turning for this year and that will provide another nice secular bump. so i think that as you look at core, there are still plenty of items and reasons that come advertise. and i think you're going to continue to see the quarter-over-quarter improvement that we've been seeing. i'm not -- i don't want to. i know you're now looking for a guidance, i'm probably not the one to give you the guidance. but we're seeing good pacings this quarter that continue that trend.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
got it. on the national side, i feel like we're -- i don't want to beat this horse again because you talked about very strong direct response mail in digital on subscription, but we're still looking at negative revenue numbers there? i feel like we're rolling off of some of the third-party stuff that you inherited with time, as well as rolling off some kind of comparable title changes that you made. could you just kind of update us on where you are? or where we all are in rolling off the time subscription [technical issues] rolling off the the comparable title on the magazine side?
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
well, i think, kyle. i would say that we are in the third year. this is the third year we actually just celebrated our anniversary of the time inc. acquisition on february 1. so, the thing that i was most excited about. we talked about the journey as to timing that it was -- the integration was a heavy lift and it was going to be full two-year integration. and what we're seeing in this year is the fruits of our labor for those two years. and we're starting to see the digital performance because we're on one unified platform. we got rid of the titles that we didn't want to set that we sold.
so even with the covid pandemic that we were hit with, which obviously, was a complete surprise -- the national media group, in the current quarter that we just closed, is up in operating profit and up in adjusted ebitda year-over-year. and they also are up for those same metrics in the first half of the fiscal year. so outstanding performance. we wish we didn't have the effect of the covid effects -- the covid issue. but again, kind of what we expected that this was the year where we were going to finally see the fruits of our labor pay off and really start to see us return to growth. we are -- it's always lumpy, and that we make it a little hard for you guys. when we made the decision on family circle last year and it creates some adjustments that we need to make. this will be the first clean quarter with no adjustments as we enter q3.
and again, on to your question on consumer. we are always looking to take advantage of consumer profits over the long-term, and i'm talking decades. we've optimized the national media group magazine business to more of an advertising-driven model. we obviously, we get revenues from consumers and advertisers, but we've sacrificed consumer profits at higher rate basis and more copies to be able to take advantage of a robust advertising marketplace. over the last year and into the future, we're going to be changing that model, because obviously, when advertising demand comes down and you see the numbers that we mentioned, where we see that demand for consumer, can we increase price, can we get rid of less profitable circulations, that's ongoing change that will happen over time. and you got to think about long-term on consumer marketing, where you get lifetime value, you acquire somebody, you can step them up in price of auto-renewals. so it takes time. and we have that accounting issue, where we've talked about that, when we optimized profit direct to publisher, subs, which are more profitable over the long run can decrease circulation revenue related to agents.
so a long-winded answer, but where we see opportunity for the magazine business. consumers love magazines. we sold more copies in our special interest copies last year than we did the year before. even with the pandemic, subscription profit is going to be up. so it's something that we're excited about or always going to be tweaking and optimizing that model.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
great, thank you.

aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
everyone, thank you for letting me be on. i appreciate your comments around net debt reduction being a priority and you've built, clearly built a healthy cash balance at end of the calendar year, which helps overall your leverage metrics. i'm curious how you're thinking about the priorities for that cash? and when you might be comfortable enough with the operating backdrop to perhaps use that cash to pay down more debt balances and bring your gross debt leverage down alongside your net debt leverage?
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
great, i'll ask jason to kind of take that.
jason m. frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, in terms of how we've thought about it, obviously, navigating the pandemic of a whole host of unknowns has been kind of a sense of caution for us. and as we look into the beginning of this calendar year, a little bit of a slow start in advertising, as tom said before. we're looking at consumer metrics, gdp, those types of things in terms of where we are and what we see in front of us. those are the kind of key metrics that we're looking for to kind of give us a little bit of a guide in terms of the timing of doing that. we're absolutely going to do that. i just want to make sure that we're being thoughtful in terms of the timing of doing that and kind of working through that in a methodical way versus maybe kind of a step back. so as the vaccine takes course and takes the impact, those are all positive trends for us. so i'd say that those are positive indicators. and as we move forward, we will continue to evaluate that and make sure that we're taking that into consideration as we determine kind of when to take down our debt and pay that off.
aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, great, that's helpful. and then if i could ask one other question. consolidation in the tv space understandably took a bit of a breather in 2020. as we embarked upon a new year with the new administration that a new fcc had, how are you thinking about the potential for meaningful m&a activity to take place in the space broadly? and what are your latest thoughts on how we should be thinking about meredith participates in? and that is either a buyer or seller of tv assets. thank you.
jason m. frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, listen. we always are looking in the marketplace for opportunities we participated in the past 12 months, looking at opportunities to acquire. obviously, our number one priority is debt reduction. so would have to be something really extraordinary that fits our strategy, either on the local media group side or on the national media group side to make a decision on that. but we're always looking and considering opportunities as we go forward. we believe we have a fantastic portfolio of television stations that obviously had record performance and threw off a lot of cash, and these two operating segments together are really performing super well and generating cash and allowing us to pay down debt and give us more flexibility as we go forward with our balance sheet and how we look at that. so that's kind of where we stand.
aaron watts -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, great. thanks again for the time.
thomas h. harty -- president, chief executive officer and director
well, i i think that wraps up our q&a session. thank you all for participating today. i just want to make one comment that we're 11 months into the covid pandemic crisis. and i just like to thank the meredith employees and were almost coming up to the anniversary, where we asked all of them to the pivot and work from home, and they obviously faced a lot of things, changed from a personal perspective and obviously from a work perspective. and i'm just thrilled with their performance and i appreciate all they've done to move meredith forward during this crisis, and thank them. so with that, i'd just like to close, and thank you very much for participating. thank you.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the meredith fiscal 2001 sic 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. mike lovell. please go ahead.
mike lovell -- executive director
good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. we will begin with comments from chairman and chief executive officer, tom harty; followed by chief financial officer, jason frierott. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ from our forecasts. reasons for the differences are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in our sec filings. certain financial measures that we are discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our slide presentation. our earnings release and slide presentation are available in the investor relations section of meredith.com. an archive of our prepared comments will be available on our website later today. and now, i'll turn the call over to tom.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thank you, mike, and good morning. i hope you've had a chance to see our news release and our related slide presentation issued earlier this morning, which includes disclosures, you'll find very useful. i'll start with slide 3. our digital advertising, licensing and digital consumer revenues continued to deliver record results. our performance was driven in part by strong consumer traffic growth, enabled by our data analytics and capabilities along with the flexibility that our digital platform offers. mature media revenue performance was mixed as our local media group delivered revenue growth, beating our expectations, while our magazine related businesses, which has a longer advertising sales cycle continue to be impacted by economic uncertainty. as we previously discussed, we continue to pursue a two-pronged strategy. first, net debt reduction is our #1 priority.
we've made tangible progress on this goal with a $251 million repayment of our debt during the third quarter. we ended the quarter with net debt at $2.6 billion and had more than $230 million of cash in the bank. second, we continue strengthening and enhancing our digital advertising and consumer-focused capabilities. we repeated a critical milestone in the third quarter as digital advertising revenues surpassed magazine for the second consecutive quarter, and our licensing and digital consumer businesses reached record highs. meanwhile, consumer engagement remains strong as sessions to our national media group digital properties continue to expand. national media group consumer-related revenues account for 50% of the segment, and we believe have strong opportunities for growth ahead. with that, let's dive deeper into our performance for the quarter. starting with the digital side of the national media group, our team delivered outstanding performance.
digital advertising revenues were $102 million, up 21% from the prior year period and a record high for a third quarter. powering our digital business is our proprietary technology platform that brings together all of our content, our unique taxonomy, first-party data and our user graph. this platform provides a comprehensive view of the consumer and how they interact with our brands, content and products. providing valuable insights and predictive trends. this holistic view and our analytic capabilities provide us with deep insights into user behavior we use to drive advertising and performance marketing dollars as well as our own content and product development strategy. our multiyear investment in our platform and data capabilities, combined with the direct relationships we have with 150 million consumers who visit our sites each month, is a competitive advantage and positions us well for a future in which third-party cookies will no longer be supported.
turning to our national media group magazine business. we spoke about a slow start to calendar year 2021 magazine advertising during our last quarterly earnings update in february. while that observation has proven true, we underestimated the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace. this uncertain environment, clients continue to be focused on bottom of the funnel, focused spending. in particular, we saw spending slow from clients in the food and beverage and prescription drug categories from our fiscal second quarter and the travel and luxury categories remain challenged. however, we believe advertisers will return to branded advertising as the economy continues to rebound and more certainty returns. magazine subscription revenues declined as we strategically shifted from agent sources and added more profitable direct to publisher subscribers. newsstand revenues declined, which was expected as we published fewer titles in the quarter compared to the prior year and as the retail and airport channels remain challenged. jason will go into some greater detail on circulation in a few moments. we plan to continue evolving and optimizing our magazine business based on advertising and consumer demand, keeping a keen eye on expenses, as we have always done.
looking more closely at the broadcasting portfolio. we delivered 5% growth in nonpolitical spot advertising revenues compared to the prior year period, driven by the professional services and home categories. it was our first quarter delivering nonpolitical spot advertising revenue growth since the pandemic began. we also benefited from continued growth in retransmission revenues. while the macroeconomic backdrop is still uncertain, we're encouraged about our performance through the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and the opportunities we're pursuing for long-term growth, particularly in our digital consumer and advertising activities. with that overview, i'll now turn it over to jason for a more detailed look at the numbers.
jason frierott -- vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, tom. i'll start on slide 4. looking at the third quarter of 2021 consolidated performance. revenues were $665 million, down 5% from the prior year period. as a reminder, we finished cycling through portfolio changes, so all comparisons today and going forward are on an apples-to-apples basis. advertising related revenues were $304 million, down 9% from the prior year period. as tom said, national media digital advertising was our strongest platform, followed by local media, nonpolitical spot advertising. these gains are more than offset by advertising declines in our mature magazine channel. consumer-related revenues were $339 million, down 2% from the prior year period. growth in national media licensing, performance marketing and local media retransmission revenues are more than offset by declines in magazine related consumer revenues. other revenue was $22 million, down 10% from the prior year period. this was primarily the result of sunsetting service agreements for sole brands and nonrepeating project work.
on a consolidated level, adjusted ebitda declined 26% to $112 million from the prior year period. the lower adjusted ebitda performance reflects lower magazine related revenues, partially offset by strong growth in digital advertising, digital consumer and licensing revenues. prior year adjusted ebitda reflects benefits from employee expense related actions taken at the start of the pandemic. fiscal 2021 third quarter free cash flow was $68 million, lower than the prior year period, primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda. as a reminder, we sold travel and leisure trademark during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 for $100 million. we received the first payment of $35 million in the third quarter, which i'll note is captured in cash flows from investing activities, and we will receive the balance over the next three years. we continue to operate and recognize revenue related to travel and leisure media platforms as part of a long-term royalty-free licensing relationship. turning next to page 5. national media group revenues were $465 million, down 8% from the prior year period. advertising related revenues were $206 million, down 12% from the prior year period, impacted by meredith declines. digital advertising grew 21% or $18 million, surpassing magazine advertising for the second consecutive quarter.
national media group consumer-related revenues were down 5% from the prior year period. we maintained a stable subscription rate base of $36 million. subscription revenues were down 9%, primarily due to our efforts to shift our subscription solicitation mix toward direct to publisher and away from third-party agents. as a reminder, this strategy reduces revenue and increases profitability by fostering a stronger relationship with subscribers, including the opportunity for rate increases as subscribers renew over time. newsstand revenues declined 20% as we published fewer titles in the third quarter compared to the prior year. additionally, we had several exceptionally strong selling titles in the prior year period, including those memorializing la lakers basketball star, kobe bryant. our licensing and digital consumer-driven revenues, which include performance marketing activities, such as e-commerce, lead generation and affiliate commerce continued to deliver strong growth, up 31% in the quarter from the prior year period. other revenues were $39 million, down 19% from the prior year period, primarily the result of sunsetting service agreements for sold brands and nonrepeating project work.
adjusted ebitda was $67 million, down 35% as it was impacted primarily by lower magazine related revenue and partially offset by strong digital revenue growth. consistent with prior quarters, let me walk you through a few digital kpis on the right side of the page. digital sessions were up 17% from the prior year period. people.com delivered the strongest year-over-year traffic growth as it continues to benefit from strong interest in celebrity and human interest stories. people.com remains the #1 destination in the entertainment category. we also delivered continued growth at allrecipes, which remains the world's largest digital food site, along with our home sites, including southern living and martha stewart. from a revenue mix standpoint, the majority of digital advertising continues to be sold directly by our sales team. we view this as a key differentiator, highlighting advertiser demand for our powerful brands, premium content and first-party data, along with flexibility that our digital platform offers. looking at the bottom right of the page, our licensing or performance marketing activities continue to gain traction led by relationships, including those with apple, amazon and walmart. turning to slide 6. local media group revenues were $201 million, up 3% from the prior year period. revenue growth was led by retransmission and nonpolitical spot advertising revenues, which were up 6% and 5%, respectively, from the prior year period.
political advertising related revenues were $5 million, down cyclically from the prior year period as expected and reflect georgia's two u.s. senate runoff races that finished in early january. these results include delivering nearly $1 million of digital political advertising revenues in the quarter captured in our p&l's third-party sales line. looking more closely at nonpolitical spot advertising performance, the professional services category continues to benefit from strong engagement and now represents 1/4 of nonpolitical spot advertising, making it our largest category. we are seeing strong growth in the online gaming category, driven by sports betting. while online sports betting is presently legal in four of our 12 markets, there are currently legalization efforts and seven more of our remaining eight markets. we also saw some benefit from several high-profile sporting events broadcast on cbs. these gains were partially offset by lower spending in the entertainment and furnishing categories. adjusted ebitda grew 3% to $59 million from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher nonpolitical spot advertising. finally, we continue to ramp production based on our national media brands, the people show, which we launched across all 12 markets last september remains a season's top new syndicated program. television is a natural extension for the people brand and the shows ratings are strong. we are working with stong pictures television to syndicate the show to non meredith stations beginning in the fall of 2022 and believe its potential at contribution to grow to the equivalent of a midsized television station. turning to slide 7. i'm pleased to report tangible progress in net debt reduction, which is our #1 priority.
we paid down $251 million of our net debt since december 31, 2020. and our debt repayment was focused on unsecured notes, which is our highest priced debt. as a company, one of our key performance measures is free cash flow. we generated $68 million of free cash flow in the third quarter compared to $100 million in the prior year period due to lower adjusted ebitda. as a result of our cash and adjusted ebitda performance, our leverage ratio on a reported basis as 4 times adjusted ebitda as of march 31, 2021, and we continue targeting a leverage ratio of 2 times adjusted ebitda over the long term. our revolving credit facility balance was 0 at march 31 and continues to be unused. we aim to continue generating positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. we ended the third quarter of 2021 with $231 million of cash in the bank, which includes the $35 million i mentioned previously from the sale of travel measure brand. now i'll turn it back to tom for closing thoughts on slide 8.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks, jason. our consumers today continue to focus on celebrity and entertainment news, house and home, food, style, health, fitness and parenting, as well as news and information about the local communities. these fundamental lifestyle categories are meredith cornerstone and even more relevant today because of the pandemic. summarizing our priorities today, i want to leave you with four key thoughts. first, our #1 priority is net debt reduction. we're making progress, having repaid $251 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. we reduced net debt by approximately $350 million so far in fiscal 2021. second, we have built a digital advertising, licensing and digital consumer business of significant scale, and we're excited about its growth and future prospects. this includes digital advertising revenues, surpassing magazine advertising revenue for a second consecutive quarter, along with another quarter of record performance for our licensing and digital consumer-driven activities. we attribute the success to several factors, including our powerful brands, which include people, allrecipes, better homes and gardens in southern living.
these brands are backed by a tremendous creative engine and collectively reach and engage nearly 95% of american women, more women than any other media portfolio in the united states. investments in our national media group digital platform and our deep first-party data and analytics capabilities. together, these assets and capabilities are meredith's differentiator and form the basis of our value proposition to advertisers and shareholders. they also position us to benefit from incremental advertising spend as the economy recovers. third, magazines play an important role in forming and inspiring consumers, and they are an efficient and impactful solution for advertisers. magazines play an important and profitable role at meredith, and we believe performance will improve as the economy continues to rebound. economic uncertainty receives and marketers invest more dollars in branding and top of funnel consumer awareness strategies. finally, we're encouraged by our year-over-year growth in nonpolitical spot advertising. as we look into our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, assuming no changes in trajectory due to covid or other macro factors. we expect national media group digital advertising revenues up in the 70% range. magazine advertising revenues approximately flat; and local media group nonpolitical spot advertising revenues to be up in the 40% range.
i'm pleased to highlight that this forecast calls for full year fiscal 2021 national media group digital advertising revenues to surpass magazine for the first time in our history. this important milestone reflects our evolution as a dynamic media company with the proven ability to engage audiences across a diverse set of platforms. we will continue to manage our mature businesses for cash generation and profitability, while directing our diversified portfolio of brands and businesses toward areas of strong growth based on audience and client demand. in closing, we continue to be encouraged by the performance and future opportunity related to our digital business, including advertising, licensing and performance marketing, along with broadcast related performance through the first nine months of fiscal 2021. with that, we'll open up the remaining time to your questions.
operator, can you please begin with the first question.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of dan kurnos with the benchmark company. the line is open.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company, llc -- analyst
great. thank you. good morning. tom, what a long way we've come to have a print quarter like that and still be consensus ebitda by $15 million. so i guess the question is really twofold, which is, one, on the quarter itself, and kudos to you guys, obviously, for managing your costs. but how much of it was potential outperformance at people? obviously, i think maybe this is the first week of the year where we didn't have a royal on the headlines, thank god, not for you guys, unfortunately. but how do we think about the outperformance in people probably in the quarter as a contributing factor relative to guess the underlying improvement in the subscription base and the other cost savings you've done in light of that, the print number. and then on the print side, flat next quarter, you're getting back there. magazine seems like a very safe place to advertise, and tv is doing particularly well. so thanks for the color on bottom of funnel. just curious on sort of how we -- how you view print now getting back toward the grow next year, getting back toward whatever you think the normalized level is?
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
we are very pleased with the quarter. i think we -- for the company as a whole and also for the national media group. and as to your point, we over-delivered from a consensus basis on the bottom line. and really, what's driving most of that outperformance is that our digital -- we talked about this on our comments that we've reached that inflection point with our digital business is bigger than our magazine business. and we're seeing outsized performance in the digital area. now we are a little disappointed from an advertising perspective on the magazine side. it's not unexpected. and there are a couple of factors that go into that, right? so last year, because we've talked about this on a lot of calls over the years that magazines have a long lead time from an advertiser commitment standpoint. it's almost two months. so when you lap -- now we're in a period right now where we feel like brighter days are ahead. but if you go back to the beginning of january, there was a lot of uncertainty, and clients want to have flexibility. so the other part of it is, is that we're up against a tougher comp. so last year, in our fiscal third quarter, print wasn't really affected at all related to the pandemic because of the long lead times. where our tv business had -- and our digital business had a slight increase.
so we know clients want flexibility. and in this uncertain times, magazines don't give all that flexibility. and as i said in my comments, the biggest part of it is that clients in these uncertain economic times are really focused on transactional spending related to -- that were really as well with digital, about point -- bottom of the funnel, next sale and magazines are a great branding environment for that. so as i look to the future, to the end of your question was, we believe that we will see improvement as the economy and the uncertainty kind of evaporates for their advertisers as we go through this calendar year. so we believe brighter days are ahead. people as a whole. now when you look at the print portfolio, it's not one brand versus the other. it's basically across the whole portfolio, we're seeing this. and actually, we're actually taking share. so the positive side is, it's not our execution or our sales teams that we're just kind of waiting for clients to make those longer term commitments. we're in touch with all of them. they're all talking very optimistically about the whole calendar year, but it's just been a lot slower to start from a print perspective.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company, llc -- analyst
got it. super helpful. and the guide is excellent, especially on digital, even above our expectations. so you're seeing nice sequential improvement. i don't know if catherine is there wants to comment on just some of the benefits you're seeing from the platform unification or the push toward video. but just any incremental color on sort of what's driving increased traction would be helpful.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
great. catherine, you want to take that?
catherine levene -- president of national media
yes, sure. so it's pretty much everything across the board that's growing on the digital side of the business. so that's extremely positive. of course, you have session growth, right? so that drives up open programmatic revenue. but it's not just session growth, it's also cpm growth. you have our direct sold business up significantly and particularly in our big clients, a big retail clients who do deep data integrations with us. so our scale, our platform, the data and insights to taxonity all allow us to deliver data -- targeting with data and impact at scale. and they're coming back to us for that. video was up as well. and as was premium programmatic. so as you know, only 40% of our revenue comes from open or direct sales force sells our premium programmatic pipe, and people are coming to us as well for that, and that's where they can get our first-party data. i think that's going to be increasingly important as third-party cookies just go away. is that helpful?
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company, llc -- analyst
yes, very helpful. i'll leave you with tom, if you'd care to comment at all on the unsubstantiated tv sale rumors, as is always the fun topic and especially in light of the fact that your nnd business looks like it's very much on the path toward a growth trajectory at this point?
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes. thanks, dan. obviously, we get this question many, many times before. and listen, as part of our strategic process, the management team and our board multiple times a year, we sit down and talk about strategically how we enhance shareholder value. and as we've talked about in the past, there's a lot of questions around is the local media group and the national media group, they need to be together? and should there -- is there shareholder value to be created as these businesses were separated. so again, we review this. we talk about it all the time. we get the question almost on every single quarter that we took -- over the years. but we really -- as a matter of policy, we don't make any public comments about our strategic process and our discussions with our board about that decision.
dan kurnos -- the benchmark company, llc -- analyst
some that are expected, but the -- i can try any way since there were the rumors out there. thank you tom, i appreciate all the call everybody.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thanks dan.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of kyle evans with stephens. the line is open.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks. a follow-on for catherine. if we look at the very strong session growth over the last two quarters. how sustainable is that? what are the drivers of that? what kind of control do you have there? it seems to be -- it's the outsized contributor to the digital strength. i'm just trying to get a sense for what that could look like for the rest of the calendar year as maybe people go back outside and quick miss around the internet as much as they have.
catherine levene -- president of national media
yes. well, a couple of things. one is, as i mentioned, it's -- our growth is driven by all of the channels that i talked about, not just by open programmatic, which is driven both by session growth, but also by cpm. so i don't want to underestimate the growth of cpm. in terms of sessions, look, i think it's all questionable about when everybody's back to the office and about we've all been stuck in front of our computers for a long term. i don't expect our session growth to be up as strong as that opens up, but we still believe we're going to have and maintain a strong session. so there'll be some growth. particularly in the categories that have been down, travel and leisure and some of our luxury properties. but i don't think the growth will be as strong. but we do believe there's still leverage in cpms in the open category and that all of our other revenue streams will continue to grow.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. and is patrick...
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
patrick's on.
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
hi kyle.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i wasn't going to let you get away. maybe just some detail around your fiscal 4q pacing? and then maybe just any kind of core outlook that you could provide for the rest of calendar '21. and then if you care to kind of throw down the [indecipherable] on political in '22 versus '20 on a calendar basis?
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
all right. well, taking them in order, look, we gave guide on the fourth quarter for plus 40 for the local media segment. look, professional services continues to show strength and growth. i think you've heard jason explain it earlier, it's now a full 25% of our local core advertising business. and an auto makes up about 20%. and we saw very modest growth for auto in q3 at like plus 3% look, as soon as these chips and rubber and foam shortages all right themselves and sort themselves out, i would say, for the rest of the calendar year, as that recovers, so will the advertising piece behind auto. but we do continue to see strength in professional and home, and we don't look for those to abate. for political, i'm very excited about our '22 cycle, even against our amazing '20 cycle. we have 13 governors races and 13 senate seats. and you've heard me say this before, even though we had a great presidential run in '20, the reality is a larger percentage of our political revenues come from those hotly contested governor and senate races. and we're going to have a full slate of those across our footprint. so i think what you'll see will be record setting.
kyle evans -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then maybe just lastly, i want to have you, and then i'll get back in the queue. just your subscription and network renewal time line looking out over the next two years, whatever you can provide.
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
yes. no, of course. thank you for asking that. we have one affiliate relations renewal coming up for our nbc at the end of the year in nashville. and then on the retrans side with cable operators, we've got two large deals up at the end of the year with cox & comcast.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
and that's calendar year, patrick, right?
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
calendar year, correct, not fiscal. thank you.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i'll turn the call back over to tom harty.
tom harty -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
great. well, we appreciate everyone's time and support, and we appreciate are -- all of our employees that have delivered great results during a very difficult year. i'd like to just make one comment and say that we're thinking about our colleagues. we have 350 colleagues in our india operation, who are coping with the devastating outbreak of covid, and we want you to know that you're all in our thoughts and your health and safety remain a top priority for us as it is with all of our employees in the u.s. so we feel brighter days are ahead for our employees and our business. and just wanted to thank all of our employees. so thank you for your attention. have a great day.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the meredith fiscal 2021 fourth quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mike lovell, investor relations.
mike lovell -- investor relations director
good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. i hope you've had the opportunity to access the press release and presentation posted to meredith's website. we'll use the presentation to structure our remarks this morning. we will begin with comments from chairman and chief executive officer, tom harty; followed by chief financial officer, jason frierott. certain financial measures that we're discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our slide presentation, which is available in the investor relations section of meredith.com.
i also want to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information today and of our safe harbor disclaimer on slide 2. also as noted on slide 3, we will be filing relevant materials with the securities and exchange commission, including a proxy statement in connection with the announced sale of our local media group to gray television. we encourage you to read these materials because they will contain important information about the company and proposed transaction. finally, please note all figures refer to fiscal 2021 fourth quarter or full year and the comparable prior year period unless otherwise noted.
and now i will turn the call over to tom, who will begin our prepared remarks, starting on slide 4.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike, and good morning. since last reporting quarterly results on april 29th, we are pleased to deliver strong progress on the strategy we've described in recent calls, net debt reduction, growth in digital advertising, advancement of our consumer focused capabilities, including performance marketing and paid products.
first, as it relates to net debt reduction, we announced the sale of our local media group to gray television in may and accepted an offer of $2.825 billion in june. we believe that the sale will unlock meaningful shareholder value and accelerates all of our top financial priorities, including materially reducing our debt. this will free up capital to invest in future high potential digital opportunities, while also enabling capital returns to shareholders.
second, as it relates to advancing our digital advertising and consumer focus capabilities. digital advertising revenues were fourth quarter record and surpassed magazine advertising for the third consecutive quarter. on the consumer side, licensing and digital consumer revenues continued to deliver record results and the newsstand channel grew as well. in total, our business remains well balanced with half our revenues based on advertising and half from consumers.
with that introduction, let's dive deeper into the fourth quarter highlights. starting with digital advertising. our team delivered strong performance driven in part by strong pricing, partially offset by slight declines in traffic. we're seeing market and consumer trends beginning to normalize, particularly compared to the year-ago period, which was heavily impacted by the onset of covid-19 pandemic. our licensing and digital consumer-driven revenues also delivered double-digit growth and record fourth quarter results. driving our digital performance is our trusted brands and large audience reach to 150 million consumers who visit our sites each month, our strong commercial partnerships and our proprietary technology platform.
as we've discussed on prior calls, our platform brings together all of our content, our unique taxonomy and first-party data. it provides a comprehensive view of the consumer and how they interact with our branded content and products, providing valuable insights and predictive trends. this holistic view and our analytic capabilities provide us with deep insights into user behavior we used to drive advertising and performance marketing dollars as well as our own content and product development strategy. for example, our performance marketing teams drove a nearly threefold increase in partner retail sales for the week during amazon's june prime day through solid execution of custom content and promotion across our sites. we performed similarly for walmart and target, who also hosted digital sales events during our fiscal fourth quarter.
the combination of our influential brands focused on women, audience reach, commercial partnerships and proprietary platforms are differentiators in the market, which drive our growing and diversified digital revenue. our magazine business is another differentiating factor. it's the largest in the united states and drive strong awareness for our brands across platforms. people and allrecipes are the industry's number one and number two brands and better homes & gardens is number six. on an average, we sell one magazine via subscription and one via newsstand every second.
while advertising performance remained soft as the uncertain economic environment caused clients to be focused on bottom of the funnel spending, we continue to see strong consumer engagement and demand for our magazines, as evidenced by 7% growth in circulation revenues driven primarily by newsstand performance. obviously, we have an easier comp as newsstand was impacted by the pandemic. however, i also want to highlight key points that make our newsstand specials, particularly attractive to consumers.
we react quickly to provide relevant in debt coverage of topics and trends that matter to our customers. we use high quality paper and we limit advertising pages. as a result, we were able to charge a premium price typically in excess of $10 per copy. in addition, consumer response rates to our subscription offers continue to be strong and we have been investing in channels that drive high lifetime value to capitalize on the opportunity. for example, we've more than doubled our direct mail offers in the fourth quarter and saw new subscription orders more than double as well. in total, our renewals were up 4% in the fourth quarter across all retention channels.
looking more closely at our broadcasting portfolio, we delivered 50% growth in nonpolitical spot advertising revenues compared to the prior year period, driven by the professional services, automotive and gaming categories. we also benefited from continued growth in retransmission revenue. finally, from a consolidated company standpoint, we delivered margin expansion. this was driven by topline growth, particularly from our digital and television businesses which have relatively higher fixed cost and thus drove positive cost leverage. consistent with our financial priorities, we continue to make progress reducing net debt and our net leverage ratio, and grew our cash position sequentially from the third quarter.
with that fourth quarter summary, i want to step back and share some thoughts on our full year performance on slide 5. it was equally remarkable and challenging, beginning under deep pressure due to covid-19 and ending with the second highest adjusted ebitda in meredith's history, approximately $20 million shy of our all-time high. it was also a transformational year shaped by several significant strategic events. first, we crossed an important milestone with digital advertising revenue surpassing magazine for the first time in meredith's history. second, the agreement to sell our local media group, as i mentioned earlier, for $2.825 billion, representing a 10 times valuation. the combination of these two events sets the stage for post-transaction meredith to be positioned as a digital-first media company with low leverage and the capacity to invest in future organic and inorganic growth.
we delivered many operational milestones during the year as well. our digital businesses delivered record revenues across the board, driven by our launch of the meredith data studio, which brings together our valuable first-party data and predictive insights to help customers improve returns on their advertising investments. both meredith data [phonetic] studio and our new digital platform have been key factors and large client expansion with walmart and kroger, among others.
strong performance from our licensing relationships with apple news plus and walmart and we retained our position as the world's second largest licensor for the sixth straight year according to the licensing global. additionally, i'm pleased to announce that our multiyear partnership with clorox, which includes our data and insights has recently been expanded to licensing with the launch of the real simple home cleaning collection available at the container store. expanding performance marketing activities in fiscal 2021, in particular our relationship with amazon, along with key retail partners, with walmart, target, and nike. in total, our performance marketing efforts drove $1 billion in retail sales for our partners during the year.
while our magazine business endured covid-19 all year, we gained more than 4 percentage points of magazine advertising market share, bringing our total of 36%. in addition, we sold nearly 20 million copies of our newsstands specials, 1 million more copies than the prior year. this is a substantial accomplishment considering many newsstands were closed or operated at reduced capacity due to covid-19. our local media group also delivered record results, driven by record political advertising revenues and continued growth in retransmission consent revenues.
finally, we delivered record free cash flow in fiscal 2021. that performance along with year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda enabled a greater than one turn reduction in our net debt ratio during the year to 3.7 times at june 30, 2021. in addition to the many performance metrics highlighted this morning, i'm pleased to share several recent social and environmental accomplishments. for example, we made sustainability accounting standards board disclosures available publicly for the first time and completed the carbon disclosure projects forest and climate questionnaire for the second year. we earned gender fair certification for achieving standards in leadership and opportunity, employees policies, advertising communications, diversity reporting and social impact related to women impairment. we've been recognized by the 50/50 women on boards as having a gender balanced board. we create a business diversity and social responsibility program to facilitate alignment with suppliers that share our values.
we launched our good impressions program that brings meredith's media and marketing, consultation services to bear for minority owned small businesses in the communities we serve. in summary, fiscal 2021 set the stage for a bright future. we have a large audience deeply engaged with our trusted brands, our digital businesses are delivering record performance, and the pending local media group transaction will enhance our ability to invest in future growth and return capital to shareholders. we are tremendously excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
with that, i'll turn it over to jason.
jason frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tom. starting on slide 6. looking at the fourth quarter '21 [indecipherable] as tom said, digital advertising was our strongest growth platform followed by nonpolitical spot advertising. while magazine advertising revenues declined 6%, that performance represented a sequential improvement compared to the third quarter.
consumer related revenues were $355 million or 7%. growth was driven by newsstand, licensing local media retransmission revenues, and digital consumer, which includes performance marketing, e-commerce and lead generation. these gains were partially offset by declines in affinity marketing revenues. other revenue was $25 million, up 24%. this was primarily the result of gains related to custom publishing relationships, partially offset by project related declines. on a consolidated level, adjusted ebitda grew 55% to $124 million. stronger adjusted ebitda performance reflects growing digital non-political advertising and consumer revenues, partially offset by lower magazine advertising revenues.
fiscal '21 fourth quarter free cash flow was $51 million. our prior year period comparison was a tough one, because collection significantly outpaced revenue in the covid period. that said, our current quarter performance represents strong cash conversion driven by ebitda improvement. looking at the full year fiscal '21 consolidated performance, advertising related revenues grew 9%, driven by strong digital and political demand, partially offset by magazine advertising. adjusting for magazine portfolio changes announced over the last year, total advertising revenues would have been up 11%.
consumer-related revenues grew 2%, as retransmission, licensing and digital consumer-driven revenues increased. this growth was partially offset by magazine subscription results that were impacted by portfolio changes and our ongoing strategy to shift from agent sources toward more profitable direct to publisher subscribers. adjusting for magazine portfolio changes announced over the last year, total consumer revenues would have been up 3%. other revenue was $81 million, down 20%. this was primarily the result of sunsetting service agreements for sold brands and non-repeating project work. on a consolidated level, adjusted ebitda grew 25% to $683 million. stronger adjusted ebitda performance reflects growing digital nonpolitical spot advertising and consumer revenues along with positive cost leverage, partially offset by lower magazine advertising revenues. one thing [phonetic] is the churn positive cost leverage, i mean that revenues grew faster than expenses. fiscal '21 full year free cash flow was a record $363 million, $112 million higher than the prior year period and in line with revenue and adjusted ebitda growth.
turning to page 7. national media group revenues were $515 million, up 16%. advertising-related revenues were $236 million, up 26%. digital advertising grew 80% magazine advertising for the third straight quarter. magazine advertising revenue performance was down 6%, represents a sequential improvement from the third quarter. as tom mentioned, we saw a stronger fourth quarter spending in the prescription drug, travel and retail categories.
national media group consumer-related revenues grew 8%. subscription revenues were [technical issues] our licensing and digital consumer-driven revenues, which include performance [technical issues] covid- related disruptions across retail. adjusted ebitda was $93 million, up 95%, reflecting growing digital and consumer revenues along with positive cost leverage, partially offset by lower magazine advertising revenues.
let me walk you through our regular digital kpis on the right side of the page. digital session declined 4% as we begin lapping the strong consumer numbers we saw last year at the start of covid-19. this was particularly true of our food and home oriented sites. we delivered strong year-over-year growth across entertainment, travel and fashion sites. people.com delivered the strongest year-over-year traffic growth as it continues to benefit from strong interest in celebrity and human interest stories. for context, fourth quarter sessions results were 15% higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
from a revenue mix standpoint, the majority of digital advertising continues to be sold directly by our sales team. we view this as a key differentiator, highlighting advertiser demand for full suite of our offerings, including our powerful brands, premium content and first-party data, along with the flexibility that our digital platform offers. looking at the bottom right of the page, our licensing and digital consumer revenue activities continue to gain traction, led by relationships, including those with apple, walmart and amazon. to summarize, the national media performance, our digital platforms continue to perform strongly and combined with consumer-related performance drove adjusted ebitda growth both for the fourth quarter and the year.
turning to slide 8 in local media group results. local media group revenues were $204 million, up 22%. revenue growth was led by nonpolitical spot advertising and retransmission revenues, which were up 50% and 5%, respectively. looking more closely at non-political spot advertising performance, we delivered revenue growth in all 25 nonpolitical spot categories we track. of particular note, in the fourth quarter, we saw the strongest growth from the professional services, automotive and gaming categories, which were up 57% collectively.
digital third-party and other revenues, which includes mni targeted media grew 57%, driven by development of new categories including vaccine awareness and higher education. adjusted ebitda grew 44% to $55 billion, primarily driven by higher non-political spot advertising. finally, as it relates to the announced sale of our local media group to gray television, we made good progress toward obtaining regulatory approvals. this includes gray announcing the sale of its flint michigan station last month. this is the only market overlap with meredith's portfolio. additionally, and not related to our local media group sale, gray announced last week it completed the acquisition of quincy media. we remain on track to close our transaction in the fourth quarter of calendar 2021 as expected.
turning to slide 9. fourth quarter '21 free cash flow was $51 million, reflecting earnings growth, partially offset by professional fees incurred related to the local media group transaction. we continue to make progress improving our net debt leverage ratio, which was 3.7 times as of june 30, 2021 compared to 5.3 times last year. our revolving credit facility balance was 0 at june 30th, the fifth straight quarter it has remained unused.
we ended fiscal 2021 with $240 million of cash, an increase from march 31, 2021. these results include positive free cash flow generation. additionally, during the quarter, we redeemed $67 million of warrants issued to our former preferred equity partners in conjunction with the time, inc. acquisition. we also incurred professional fees related to our proposed local media group transaction.
turning to slide 10. when we announced the local media group sale on may 3rd, we also discussed our intention to expand the financial reporting to three segments, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, consistent with the way we began managing our business on july 1st of this year. these segments are digital, magazine, and the local media group. the bar chart on the slide shows revenue for fiscal '21 as reported with two segments and on a pro forma basis with these new segments, with magazine accounting for approximately 65% of national media group revenues and digital accounting for approximately 35%. looking at adjusted ebitda directionally in fiscal '21, digital delivered roughly two thirds of the national media group's $392 million of adjusted ebitda.
the table at the bottom right gives direction where revenue line items will be included. our effort has focused on isolating our magazine business, while grouping our faster growing digital licensing and performance marketing businesses into our new digital segment. we're excited about our future digital growth, the differentiated position we continue to develop and meredith's continued transformation to a digital first company.
now, i'll turn it back to tom for closing thoughts, on slide 11.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jason. our consumers today continue to focus on celebrity and entertainment news, house and home, food, style, health, fitness and parenting, as well as news and information about their local communities. these fundamental lifestyle categories are meredith's cornerstone and even more relevant in today's market.
in closing, i want to leave you with four key thoughts. first, our digital advertising and consumer-related activities continue to deliver revenue growth, driven by our trusted in powerful brands focused on women, proprietary technology platform, strong commercial partnerships and our large audience reach. these assets are unique in the marketplace and form the basis for our differentiation.
second, consumer demand for our magazines in the fourth quarter was stable even as advertising performance is uncertain. in addition to showcasing our beautiful photography and long-form storytelling, the magazine platform plays an important consumer awareness and marketing role for our powerful brands, including people, allrecipes, better homes & gardens and southern living. consider our presence in the home with 36 million active subscriptions and our position at retail with 2 million newsstand pockets nationwide, while advertising demand is variable and uncertain, our connection to the individual consumer remained stable and durable.
third, we are on track to close the local media group transaction in the fourth quarter of calendar 2021 as expected. we believe the sale will accelerate all of our top financial priorities, including materially reducing debt and freeing capital we invest in future high potential digital opportunities, while also enabling capital returns to shareholders.
fourth, from an expense standpoint, we've seen evidence of inflation over the last six months consistent with others in our industry and across the broader economy, particularly paper, postage and employee-related expenses. additionally, we anticipate incremental spending on strategic investments focused on fueling continued digital and consumer growth initiatives. as you know, we have a well-established track record of careful expense management and we will bring that discipline to bear to the extent possible. as we look into our fiscal 2022 first quarter compared to the prior year period, assuming no changes in trajectory due to covid or other macro factors, we expect digital advertising revenues up in the 20% range, magazine advertising revenues down in the mid-teens, and local media group nonpolitical spot advertising revenues to be up in the mid-teens.
as i said in my opening comments, fiscal 2021 was remarkable and challenging. i'm proud of the way we responded to the challenges and capitalized on opportunities to deliver the second highest adjusted ebitda in the company's history. our progress in fiscal 2021 set the stage for a bright future. we possess a large and deeply engaged audience across multiple media platform. our proprietary digital and data analytics capabilities are delivering record performance and our pending local media group transaction will enhance our ability to invest in future growth and return capital to shareholders.
in closing, i want to take a moment to sincerely thank our talented and creative employees who made our fiscal 2021 results possible. this includes our sales and marketing professionals, support groups, and editorial teams who earned more than 200 accolades and awards in fiscal 2021, including parents and food and wine were named national magazine award finalist by the american society of magazine editor's. people, allrecipes and instyle remains adweek's hot list. and our stations in kansas city, saint louis and atlanta earned prestigious edward r. murrow award with wgcl winning overall excellence award.
with that, we'll open up the remaining time for your questions. operator, please begin with our first question.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john janedis with wolfe research.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, tom.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
you talked about the funnel. so can you give more color on the magazine business, it's going up against easier and easier comps and it looks like you're expecting some weakness still here. so what are you hearing from advertisers in key verticals? is there any line of sight for the advertising bucket to improve to flattish or even possibly grow at some point or does the growth really come from the mix shift to digital? and then maybe big picture, when you talked about m&a and digital opportunities, can you give us more color on the types of things you find interesting and do they need to be accretive in the short-term?
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, great, john. good morning. what we're -- obviously, there's always a lot of things that go into performance. but what we're hearing from clients on the print side, print is a great format for branding and longer-term brand building and with the uncertainty in the pandemic and looking for quicker results, there's been a shift -- a significant shift to digital, which is more bottom of the funnel, transactional in nature and that's why you're seeing a lot of growth in our performance marketing and it's happening across the industry. so we're cautiously optimistic that print is going to be recovering. we are seeing in certain categories in our travel, in our luxury, we're seeing signs of growth year-over-year coming up. but there are other areas where we hear -- we still hear supply chain issues, commodity price increases from some of our bigger packaged good client. so it is a little slower than we expected on the recovery, but we do expect a print recovery because we're down or down so far. but the digital performance has been outstanding. we continue to believe and bullish on our portfolio of digital brands and the growth that we see there. i think we're looking at is -- on the digital side, i'm going to ask catherine to make some comments.
when we look at acquisitions and growth, we are really focused -- laser-focused on the consumer side of our digital business and looking to grow consumer revenue on our digital space. so i think that we're kind of focused on both, both internally and looking for acquisitions in that area. catherine might make some comments on that.
catherine levene -- president of national media
hi. yeah, tom said it. so a balancing of our revenue streams in the digital side of the business, so that would be anything that has consumer revenue associated with it that could be subscription-based, it could be performance, marketing-based, so in that area. video, we're growing our video nicely right now but we could accelerate that through acquisitions in that area. and the third area may be around different categories or audiences. so those are really the three areas that we look at. and from that perspective anything that we would add, that it's -- that it's around audiences would fit right into our strategic flywheel.
john janedis -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. all right, thank you very much.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, john.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dan kurnos with the benchmark company.
daniel kurnos -- he benchmark company -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning. let me press a little bit on the digital side here. you're september guidance actually relative to the backdrop and what we heard from other digital publishers is actually pretty impressive. a lot of other guys including one of our favorites that we like to talk to you about guided down sequentially from the june to september quarter given, obviously, increased mobility and the change in some of the trends. so can you just talk about, obviously, people had a tremendous quarter, continues to be strong. can you just talk about what you're seeing and how we should think about digital relative to some of the covid tailwinds starting to come out? do you feel comfortable that this is a good base even as we see increased mobility from here?
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm going to ask catherine to dig a little deeper. but, dan, to your point, i think obviously, our fourth quarter performance in digital 80% growth was off a lower base related to covid. but when you start looking at our q1, we were up last year. i think we were in the high '20s last year and now we're predicting again, so strong year-over-year growth. catherine, do you want to make some comments.
catherine levene -- president of national media
yeah, i mean, it's a combination of our brands and a flight to quality from that perspective. pricing, so we are still seeing significant increase in pricing year-over-year across the board between all of our products, and then of course, our data and platform is really driving a lot of significant scale in results right now. so we're able with our diverse ad products portfolio to deliver a variety of different solutions for advertisers.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
and while we look at our guide on advertising while print is a little softer, the strength of digital, we will be -- we will be up in overall advertising year-over-year.
daniel kurnos -- he benchmark company -- analyst
great. and then maybe just one for jason or tom you want to pitch in too, just on the margin about some of the cost inflation commentary. obviously, some of the covid costs coming back in as well. you had a really good june quarter 18% in nmg, i want to focus on nmg, obviously. directionally, how do we think about kind of margins over the balance of this year relative to kind of how you finished off 2021, understanding obviously that there is going to be seasonality issue?
jason frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think, dan, on the flip side you said there is some distant some lumpiness in there in terms of some of the costs comments that tom made. i'd say that we have investments in kind of strategic digital investments. it will probably most likely sit there in terms of -- we're roughly half the cost. in terms of the print inflation, obviously, the u.s. postal service inflation rates, those types of things. but we're working to kind of offset that. so i wouldn't expect that to have a material change in terms of rate. and then broadly across everybody, this past year we had specific cost actions that we took that were temporary, that both were in the magazine business and the digital business. so i'd say that would kind of hit both businesses. but again with topline growth in the advertising side, we should be able to kind of hold that, obviously we're not giving guidance in terms of margin rates on the go forward, but those will be the common search [phonetic] here.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i think, dan, as you look at -- we're excited to come out when we report our first quarter with our new segments and to jason's commentary in the script around the digital side of the business now approximately representing two-thirds of the national media group ebitda for the prior year. you can start thinking about the margins related to that. you're probably thinking in the range of television margins related to our new digital segment as you go forward.
daniel kurnos -- he benchmark company -- analyst
awesome. thanks for all the color, guys this quarter [indecipherable]
jason frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of jason bazinet with citi.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i just had one question. at least relative to our estimates, the ads were about in line, but it's really the consumer side on the national segment that really did very well. do you think that stimulus played a role in the quarterly strength in terms of some of that, probably licensing the newsstand and some of the other things you highlighted will be difficult to replicate? or is your sense that stimulus is really a non event?
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm sure stimulus obviously is helping the broader economy, but i think this has been a long-term strategy of ours to build up, specifically our performance, marketing and e-commerce activities on our digital side of the business. i think our comments kind of speak for themselves where you start thinking about that we generated a $1 billion in retail sales from our activity associated with that and now getting a piece of that action. so we're bullish on that side of the house. and then even on the magazine side, we've talked about in the prior year the strength of the consumer demand for magazine. so in our premium publishing area for the year, we were up 10% in revenue in our premium publishing where we sell on the newsstand and sell close to 20 million copies, up 1 million copies. that was strong performance in the fourth quarter.
and then when you start thinking about -- we're looking to get more direct-to-publisher. we've been investing lifetime value subscriptions on the magazine side. the highest value is our direct to publisher where we have the direct relationship. and when we look at our fourth quarter direct-to-publisher, renewals were up about 5% and then direct-to-publisher new was up about 47%. so that really bodes well for magazine subscriptions at longer-term. the issues we've been having is related to advertising, but the consumer demand for both on our digital side and on our magazine side are really kind of outstanding.
jason bazinet -- citigroup -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of kyle evans with stephens.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
hi, thanks. congrats on a very strong digital ad quarter. i think we're all sitting here trying to figure out where it's going to settle out with the 80% quarter going to a 20% guidance. catherine, i know i'm not going to be able to just trick into guiding us on at bit. maybe if you could just talk at a high level about where you think sessions will go over the next 12 months? where pricing will go over the next 12 months? where ad mix will go over the next 12 months? and then i've got a follow-up question. thanks.
catherine levene -- president of national media
sure. i mean, i think sessions will sort of hover around likelihood in the flat to slightly up range to be slight down because i sort of focus in the flat because we had such a strong quarter over year last year. pricing, it is up significantly for us. i think, and that's across the board in all of our ad businesses, so that goes from our direct business to our premium programmatic business, to our open programmatic business and that is again because of a lot of the investments we made over the years in data and our proprietary platform that is able to deliver real specific audiences against real context with trusted content. so i think there is pricing opportunities. i also think our performance marketing business has got a lot of growth left in it. we're making investments this year that return quite quickly for us. so i'd say those two big areas are the ones that i would look at. and finally, its our direct relationships with our clients that allow for a more multi-year, multi-million dollar really integrated partnership with large, large clients from the ones that tom has mentioned on the phone today to others that are utilizing these new integrated products that we have. hope that's helpful.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
it is. thank you. and i guess you're not going to get a whole lot of tv questions going forward. but i think i'll sneak one more in before it goes away. just a quick update on your retrend sub counts, please? thank you.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer
great, patrick?
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
yeah, we're seeing the sub counts continue. we lose more cable and satellite and pick up more ott on a regular basis. and i think, jason, on the year -- for the year, what were we at for subs, flat to down one.
jason frierott -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think its down one is the right ballpark.
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
yeah. and as a reminder, on our cadence, we have two major deals coming up at the end of the year.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
while i've got you, do you have an ott contribution for overall return subs.
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
i don't have that breakout in front of me, but we can get that to you in the follow-ups.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
great, thank you.
patrick mccreery -- president of local media group
sure.
operator
there are no great question at this time.
tom harty -- chairman and chief executive officer

"
2019-Q2,MDP,,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, my name is leandra and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to meredith's fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings conference call. all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (operator instructions) mr. mike lovell, investor relations director, you may begin your conference.
mike lovell -- investor relations
good morning and thanks everyone for joining us. our call today will begin with comments from president and chief executive officer, tom harty, followed by chief financial officer, joe ceryanec. then we'll turn the call over to your questions. also on the line with us today are national media group president, jon werther; and local media group president, patrick mccreery. an archive of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon. remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from our forecasts. some of the reasons are described at the end of our news release that was issued earlier this morning and in some of our sec filings.
certain financial measures that we're discussing on this call are expressed on a non-gaap basis and have been adjusted to exclude the impact of special items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures are included in our earnings release which is available on the investor relations section of our website. with that, tom will begin.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
thank you very much, mike, and good morning , everyone. i hope you've had the opportunity to see our news release that was issued earlier this morning. i'll begin with a quick review of our fiscal 2019 first half accomplishments and early second half revenue outlook. then i'll update you on the integration of time, inc. and the strategies that we're pursuing to maximize our new and exciting national media portfolio. cfo, joe ceryanec will then provide detail on our very robust local media group operations, discuss our fiscal 2019 second quarter and first half results, and provide a financial outlook for both our third quarter and full year ending june 30th, 2019.
before i begin, i want to acknowledge the many contributions made by steve lacy on behalf of the meredith corporation during his 21 years of service. as many of you know, steve will retire as executive chairman on march 31st, but continue to serve as chairman of the board. steve was a great steward of our shareholders' investment, doubling revenue and tripling profit during his tenure at meredith. on behalf of all of us, i want to say thank you. on a lighter note, steve participated in 84 of these quarterly conference calls and i'm sure he appreciates someone else doing it for a change.
as we turn the corner into early calendar 2019, we are particularly excited about calendar 2019 advertising trends, where we see significant improvement in both our national and local media groups. in our national media group, we see total comparable advertising revenue pacing down in the mid-single digits. this is a significant improvement compared to what we experienced in calendar 2018 as we work to integrate the time, inc. titles. it's also in line with meredith's historical and expected long-term performance.
in our local media group, non-political advertising revenue is pacing up in the mid-single digits, driven by the professional services, media and furnishing categories. these categories represent more than 30% of non-political advertising revenues and are all up in the double digits, offsetting declines in automotive that are driven by lower spending for manufacturers.
turning to our performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we are pleased to deliver stronger than expected revenue, profit and related margin performance. of note, national media group margins significantly improved, reflecting our enhanced brand portfolio and ongoing work to drive efficiencies.
local media group margins improved as well, reflecting the record $102 million of political advertising revenues we generated. additionally, we generated $638 million of consumer-related revenue accounting for 40% of meredith's total revenues. this revenue is contractual in nature, highly stable and recurring. we also negotiated several key agreements to position meredith for future growth and as a result have strengthened our balance sheet.
of note, our local media group entered into multi-year agreements with comcast and cox communications to continue carrying our broadcast in the markets we share. at the same time, we renewed all five of our fox affiliations, securing carriage in these markets in the fiscal year 2023.
we are pleased with the terms and conditions of all of these agreements. we renewed our robust brand licensing program at walmart through our fiscal year 2021. we closed on the sale of the time and fortune media brands for a combined $340 million in cash. we used those proceeds along with cash generated from our operations to repay $700 million of our debt. we are well on our way to delivering our $1 billion debt reduction goal this year.
finally, we continue to grow the amount of cash returned to our shareholders by raising the regular dividend by 5.5% to $2.30 on an annualized basis. we now paid dividends for 72 consecutive years and raised them for 26 straight years. importantly, since launching our total shareholder return strategy in 2011, we've moved -- we've more than doubled our dividend and delivered a 15% average annual return for our shareholders.
now let's turn to review of our group operating performance, beginning with our national media group. fiscal 2019 second quarter national media group operating profit was $45 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $69 million and adjusted ebitda grew to $131 million. revenues rose by 140% to $591 million, these results exclude discontinued operations.
fiscal 2019 first half national media group operating profit was $63 million. excluding special items, operating profit was $100 million and adjusted ebitda grew to $218 million. revenues rose by more than 130% to $1.1 billion. it was just over one year ago when we closed on the acquisition of time, inc., since then, we've made significant progress on the five key strategic initiatives that we put in place to integrate and maximize our new portfolio.
to start, we said we would improve the advertising performance of the acquired time, inc. properties to meredith's historical levels over time. to accomplish this, we executed three key initiatives. first, we reorganized the way these brands went to market and implemented meredith's sales and operating strategies, standards and disciplines across the portfolio. second, we invested in sales and marketing resources and activities. third, we aggressively marketed the new portfolio resulting in increased access to new advertising and marketing budgets even though most clients had already allocated the bulk of their calendar 2018 advertising budgets.
as calendar 2018 progressed, we kept at it, securing victories, large and small along the way. these moves earned our brand several agency preferred partnerships and access to calendar 2019 advertising campaigns. as a result, as we look into early calendar 2019 advertising performance, we see comparable print advertising revenue performance down in the mid-single digits. this is true with brands in both the legacy meredith and legacy time, inc. portfolios.
next, we said we would raise the profit margins of the acquired time,inc. digital properties to meredith's high levels. i'm pleased to say that we are accomplishing our goal in a challenging digital advertising environment. our new digital platform combines premium content from the most trusted brands in media and deep engagement with our audience of 140 million unique visitors per month which rich insights that help our advertising partners drive a strong return on their investment.
we are well positioned to benefit from fast growing advertising platforms including native, video, shopper marketing, programmatic and social. our digital activities today operate at margins similar to the national media group as a whole and we expect revenue and margin growth in fiscal 2019, compared to the prior year. third, we committed to growing our high margin consumer related revenue by leveraging our expanded brand portfolio. we are executing this plan on a number of fronts. for example, we are cross promoting titles to increase revenue and lower subscription acquisition cost, leveraging affinity marketer synapse including expanding beyond traditional magazine subscriptions and growing our brand licensing business, which is ranked as the world's second largest.
this includes having recently renewed our industry-leading licensing agreement for the better homes and gardens line of products with walmart. we are also seeing enhanced digital first opportunities, including e-commerce and affiliate content marketing, where we generate revenues from lead generation and paid products such as membership programs, built around our brands. as a result, during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, consumer related revenue accounted for 44% of total national media group revenue.
fourth, we announced a comprehensive review of our media portfolio and began a process to divest brands and businesses not core to our business. since then we've realized proceeds of $340 million through the sales of the time and fortune media brands and we've used the proceeds from the debt reduction i mentioned earlier. let me add that these were very attractive prices. we anticipate agreements to sell the sports illustrated and money brands, along with our 60% equity investment in viant to be finalized in fiscal 2019.
finally, we've identified at least $550 million of annual cost synergies, we expect to realize by the end of our first two years of combined operations and we began the work to harvest those savings. for example, during calendar 2018, we put in place and executed against most aspects of the integration. for example, we fully integrated our hr, finance, legal and it functions. from an operation standpoint, we've transitioned all advertising production, magazine subscription and consumer marketing functions to meredith's footprint.
we expect approximately half of the identified savings to come from already announced reductions in headcount, with the remainder of the savings coming from vendor contracts, real estate and other non-headcount-related activities. with that review of our national media group performance, i'll turn it over to cfo, joe ceryanec, to update our local media group performance, summarize our fiscal 2019 second quarter and first half results and update our financial outlook.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, tom, and good morning, everybody. fiscal 2019 second quarter local media group operating profit was $107 million, adjusted ebitda was $116 million and revenues grew to $262 million. all of these metrics were records for a fiscal second quarter. fiscal 2019 first half, local media group operating profit was $174 million, adjusted ebitda was $194 million and revenues grew to $477 million, also all records.
our second quarter performance was led by political advertising revenues of $66 million. that was 65% higher than what we delivered during the last political cycle in the second quarter of our fiscal 2017. political spending was particularly robust in the phoenix, las vegas, st. louis and kansas city markets, primarily due to very competitive races at the federal, state and local levels.
non-political ad revenues grew 16% to $120 million, including the addition of mni targeted media, which delivered revenue growth of 18%. we're excited about the opportunity that mni brings to our local media group. mni was a subsidiary within time, inc. and is a media planning and buying company with 50 years of experience in targeted marketing at the local, regional and national levels. we're in the process of expanding its scale and improving its margins. consumer-related revenues at our local media group increased 18% to $74 million, due to growth in fees from cable and satellite television operators. these increases were partially offset by higher payments to affiliated networks.
our consumer connection remains very strong. the number of pay-tv subscribers across our markets grew in the second quarter of 2018, compared to the year ago period, driven by growth in ott subscribers. additionally, our stations delivered strong financial performance during the november ratings period, which stations in 8 of our 12 markets ranking number one or number two in morning or late news.
as tom mentioned, we renewed retransmission agreements with comcast and cox, representing 35% of our subscriber base and extended our fox affiliation agreements into fiscal 2023. we expect to renew another 60% of our mvpd contracts in fiscal 2020, while our cbs and nbc affiliation agreements are in place until mid calendar 2020. as a result, we expect to see an increase in net retransmission process profit contribution through fiscal 2020.
with that, i'll review -- with that review of our local media group performance, i'll summarize our fiscal 2019 second quarter financial performance.
total company revenues from continuing operations more than doubled to $854 million, total advertising revenues, doubled to $489 million, and consumer-related revenues also doubled to $337 million. earnings from continuing operations, including special items in both periods, were $87 million, compared to $159 million last year.
as you may recall, the prior year reflected a benefit of $133 million from tax reform. we recorded $5 million of net special items after tax in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and earnings per share from continuing operations were 1.43. excluding special items in both periods, earnings from continuing operations increased to $92 million in the second quarter of fiscal '19, compared to $52 million in the prior-year. earnings per share increased to $1.53, compared to $1.14. and adjusted ebitda more than doubled to $231 million, compared to $85 million. and adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.55, compared to $1.34.
as detailed in our press release issued this morning, we've repaid a total of $700 million of our debt since closing on the time, inc. acquisition. this includes $573 million of our term loan b and $127 million of our bonds. this brings us to 70% of the way toward our goal of paying down 1 billion of debt during our current fiscal year. our net debt stood at 2.4 billion at january 31, 2019.
and finally, just last week, we raised meredith's regular dividend by 5.5% to $2.30 on an annualized basis. this marks our 26th straight year of dividend increases for meredith and the company has paid an annual dividend for 72 consecutive years, and we're proud to be a dividend aristocrat. since launching our total shareholder return strategy in october of 2011, we've increased our dividend of more than 125% and delivered an average annual return of 15%.
now turning to our outlook. for the full year fiscal 2019, we expect the total company revenues will range from 3 billion to 3.2 billion, which is unchanged from our original guidance communicated on august 10, 2018. earnings from continuing operations to range from $187 million to $207 million and from $2.40 to $2.82 on a per share basis. this includes a net after tax charge for the first half special items of $18 million.
our actual results for the full fiscal year may include additional special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. excluding special items,, we continue to expect earnings from continuing operations to range from $205 million to $225 million or $2.78 to $3.20 on a per share basis. this is also unchanged from our original guidance we communicated in august.
finally, we expect adjusted ebitda to range from $720 million to $750 million, which again is unchanged from our original guidance. and adjusted earnings per share to range from $6.89 to $7.31.
now looking at the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect total company revenues will range from $715 million to $735 million. that includes national media group revenues to range from $530 million to$540 million, and local media group revenues to range from $185 million to $195 million.
earnings from continuing operations to range from $29 million to $36 million and from $0.21 to $0.36 on a per share basis. again, these ranges do not include special items and actual results may include special items that have not occurred and again are difficult to predict. and finally, we expect adjusted ebitda to range from $145 million to $155 million, and adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.25 to $1.41.
now, i will turn it back to tom to conclude our comments and lead the q&a.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
thank you very much, joe. let me close our formal comments this morning with what we continue to believe is a compelling investment thesis for the new meredith corporation. the diverse set of businesses and brands that we now own and operate produce consistently strong cash flows and is driven by trusted national brands with an unrivaled reach to american women, particularly millennials and attractive group of television stations in large and fast growing markets. a highly profitable and growing digital business now of meaningful scale, high margin consumer revenue activities that are based on both our strong national and local brands, and a strong and proven management team with a very successful record of integrating acquisitions, a history of generating strong cash flows and growing shareholder value over time.
without a doubt, calendar 2018 will go down as a transformational and perhaps the busiest year in the history of the meredith corporation. i couldn't be prouder of the effort turned in by our operating groups and our corporate functions. i know i speak for our board, steve and our senior management team in thanking and congratulating everyone for the long hours and hard work. while there is still more to be accomplished, we are very proud to be delivering on our plan. this includes the stronger trends we are seeing an advertising performance, in both our national and local media groups along with the progress we're making toward our debt reduction goals.
now, we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have this morning.

(operator instructions)
your first question comes from the line of dan kurnos with benchmark. your line is open.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
good morning, dan.
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
good morning, there we go, just like steve. so just a couple of questions here. the tough since we don't have real clean comps yet, but can you just clarify in the quarter itself, how national print and digital did and then on the q1 guide. just again to be clear, tom, you talked about improving digital trends and you said you were pacing, i guess in this quarter down mid-single digits in line with historical meredith. so i'm just trying to line up exactly if that foots and then maybe what the sub trends were in the other segments to get to your numbers?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yes, i'll have joe dig out the breakdown for print going backwards. but overall, i have the numbers right here, dan, if you looked at the national media group, combined print and digital performance in q1. and we've talked about this before, we were talking about sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. so in q1, combined, we were down 12%. in q2, we were down 10% and that includes both portfolios combined. and now we're giving guidance, that will be down about mid-single digits. so, significant improvement and positive outlook for q3. and i don't know joe, if you have any...
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah. well -- and if we just break our print, dan, in q1 -- fiscal q1 and fiscal q2, the print combined was down kind of in the mid-teens. as tom said, q2 was a little better than q1. and now in q3, we're looking at print down in kind of the mid to high teens. so -- i'm sorry mid to high single digit.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
so we're looking for about 800 basis point improvement in q3 versus q2.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
and the time portfolio and the meredith portfolio both kind of in line with as we've talked about historical meredith trend. so a real significant improvement as we moved into q3 on the time portfolio, especially. and you had a question to follow up on the sub counts?
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
yeah, just on the national side, i'm just trying to parse out the consumer related. so i'm just curious if you have any incremental color on how subscription and newsstand did in the quarter and how they're kind of pacing going forward?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
joe can dig out there if we have the numbers particularly, but the sub counts are rock solid and consistently about the same. we have about 42 million print subscribers and that's been consistent year-over-year when you combine the two portfolios. newsstand has been a little weaker, and this is really that we're bucking some industry trends with shopping visits and grocery stores down, so we're seeing a little bit more headwinds in the newsstand, but it represents a very small percentage of our total consumer revenue.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, dan, what we're seeing and again the numbers are not comparable in q2. those start becoming more comparable into q3 obviously, but we're seeing subscription revenue fairly flattish, maybe up just a titch, and we're seeing, as tom said, newsstand is down a few percent.
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
got it. and just last one from me if i could. just on your local pacings, i was just a little bit confused, is that -- i'm assuming the up mid single, is that with consumer related? is that with retrans or is that actually (inaudible) is that just pure core?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
that's pure core advertising. and that'll be... (multiple speakers)
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
and is that including? is that organic or is that including the time stuff that you acquired?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
that's organic, dan. we do benefit this quarter from the super bowl being heavy cbs. so we're pacing probably ahead of our comp set, but we -- even it's never exact, but trying to remove the effect of the super bowl, we would still be pacing up probably low single-digits organically.
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
perfect. (inaudible)
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
and our guidance is up mid single.
dan kurnos -- benchmark -- analyst
got it. all right, thanks guys. i appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of kyle evans with stephens. your line is open.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
good morning, kyle.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
hey, how are you? a quick follow-up on that last question. i just want to make sure that mni, i think you said was up 18% in 2q. and i want to make sure that when we're talking about core in lmg that we're not including that?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
mni is going to run through the consumer line. no, third-party sales. okay?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
mni is up 18% in q2.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
yeah, i don't have third-party sales broken out, because i don't have a q.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
well, you will have it later today, kyle.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
awesome.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
q is coming out, yeah.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
okay. but just to be clear, that's...
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, the -- just to be clear, back to dan's question, the local non-political ad pacing up mid single digits is truly organic. it does not include mni.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
okay, great. you guys -- the corporate expenses were down pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter. is that all synergy, is there some seasonality there and kind of what's the outlook for the second half of the year on that line and maybe even -- look forward into fiscal '20?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
it is synergies coming in kyle, in corporate, a lot of our facilities, a lot of the -- what i'll call shared service functions, it, accounting finance run through there. and that's a good chunk of it. and i think for the next two quarters, we'll probably see similar to maybe slightly reduced corporate expenses. now, if you're looking at the -- without special items, you had a lot of transaction costs in there, but we pull those out for special items.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
and you gave us those in the tables back too.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, they're in the tables.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
the -- you mentioned that you have 60% renewing on retrans in fiscal '20.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
could you give us the cadence across the year there, so we know when to kind of look for percent per month increases?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
joe's digging it out.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
hold on.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
and maybe just while you're shuffling papers there, also just kind of a long-term net retrans growth comment.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yes, we -- longer term, we believe that net retrans will grow kind of that mid-single digits, mid-to-single high digits longer term, that's our stated hypothesis going forward.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
and the fox renewal didn't caused that to change one way or the other.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
no, we were very pleased with the fox renewal.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, so kyle, as i'm looking at the mvpds that renew, we've got about 14 -- 28% of renewing in the first half of the calendar year. so, not quite half and that's going to include dish needing a new charter. and then later in the year, the biggest mvpd, which is at&t directv, which is almost the other half is in may. so almost toward the end of fiscal '20. so about half of the 60% in the first half of the year and the other half toward the end of the fiscal year.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
great. lastly, i know we're not going to talk about legacy, you warned me off that last quarter. but maybe just some very high level commentary on how people is performing. i think maybe even some of us that follow time as a stand-alone company may have underestimated the importance of that title. and that's my last question. thanks.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah, people is improving across the portfolio. so we're seeing the same improvement that we're seeing. i talked about 800 basis point improvement. quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing the same kind of improvement in people also. so this is -- we've got some titles now on the time legacy side that are actually up year-over-year, which we're excited about. but when you take it and blend it all together, as i said before, the whole portfolio is kind of performing about the same. when you look back at the -- when they had a really poor performance, when they went through the reorganization a couple of years ago, you could point at the portfolio and see the brand is performing the same. so we're seeing that recovery come back the same way.
kyle evans -- stephens -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of craig huber with huber research partners. your line is open.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
good morning, craig.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
yes. good morning. hey, good morning. thank you very much. just a few questions if i could. maybe we could start out with digital. these past three quarters -- the past two quarters, plus the current quarter we're in right now, digital ad revenue percent change year-over-year, if you could just give us that, you gave us the point. thank you for that.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
the last two quarters, i know, that our digital performance is basically flat from a digital perspective advertising on a comparable basis, i don't have the prior quarter...
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, q1 was up just a titch, q2 was flat and right now, we're flattish in q3 as well.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah. and when we look at the performance, when we benchmark ourselves against our competitors, which we would call premium publishers in the digital space, we believe we're outperforming that we believe, a lot of our competitors are down double-digits in that space.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
and then also your long-term guidance i guess for next year, the bit $1 billion ebitda target. what are you thinking for that year embedded in that target for magazine advertising percent change year-over-year and also the circulation piece of it. what's your sort of outlook there that's embedded in that $1 billion number? so i assume those are the two big variables here in order to get to that number. i assume you're pretty darn comfortable with your $550 million cost save...
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah. craig, i'd just like to first correct you that we haven't given the guidance number yet for next fiscal year. but the $1 billion is stated goal of ours. and as we move now into our budgeting process, we're going to take a look at and we'll obviously be giving guidance at the end of this fiscal year. we're always weighing short term goals against our long-term strategy of investing in the business for sustained growth. and as we look out, we believe that we're going to hit that $1 billion goal, no matter what, worst case by fiscal 2021. but our hypothesis hasn't changed on where we believe print advertising is now is we're seeing the time portfolio start to perform similar to the meredith portfolio. we believe that print will decline in that kind of mid-single digit range. digital will be up in that mid-single digit range, and overall, consumer revenue will continue to grow.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
and then also if i could just ask, what's your current thoughts on your appetite for tv station acquisitions in terms of how much capacity do you feel you have on the debt side. so i think in the most recent, i think you've said you have maybe $200 million or so capacity on that front. thank you.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
well, i'll let joe pile on here. but we look at every single broadcast deal that comes about. and we believe we have a lot of dry powder to be looking at acquisitions. we have before we -- a year ago, when we announced the time, inc. deal, we feel we had borrowing capacity, especially in the broadcast area. and that's one of the reasons why we've been so aggressively paying down debt to get more dry powder to take a look at new opportunities that come up.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd say the same thing tom said. i mean, our focus is getting that leverage down to 2 times to give us more flexibility to whether it's on the broadcast side or the digital side, but just to start looking again at m&a.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of jason bazinet with citi. your line is open.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
good morning, jason.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
good morning. i just had two broad questions. in terms of hitting the $1 billion of debt reduction by the end of the fiscal year, what -- is the number on the balance sheet and assets held for sale a reasonable proxy for what sort of proceeds you need from si and money and the 60% stake in volume. and my second question is, has anything changed -- i think the buy side is very nervous about a slowing macroeconomy. and is there anything that you're seeing sort of in the broader ad ecosystem or the behavior of your clients? that sort of suggests that's a reasonable concern to have. thanks.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
i'll give joe the first one related to the asset sales, and what's on the balance sheet.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
so i just did some quick math, jason, that if you take the net assets plus liabilities, it's $170 million. i would say, we feel like we could get to our $1 billion goal. we would need some of that, maybe not all of it.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
okay.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
as tom said, it's really si, there's also website within si that's fansided. so there's really two assets there, you've got money and you've got volume. so we continue to believe we're going to get those assets sold, we continue to believe the value on our balance sheet is reasonable, but i would say we need some of that, but maybe not all of it to get to our $1 billion. as you heard us say, we are at -- we were at 700 through the end of january. so about 300 to go.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah. and on your broader question about the advertising trends, we are cautiously optimistic about calendar year 2019, especially if you just heard the guidance that we gave for our q3, both sides of the business, the local and national, we're very optimistic right now. but obviously, advertising expenditures are totally correlated to the broader economy, but so far, we aren't seeing any of our advertisers signaling anything related to pulling back, but obviously we watch it as we go along.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
and i guess the one thing, jason. when we compare the business today versus where we were 10 years ago. and one of the reasons we are stressing the consumer revenue, i mean, 44% of the revenue now on the national media group is coming through 10s of millions of individual transactions. we also now have the retrans and i don't have the percent in front of me, but a significant percentage of the local which 10 years ago we did not have. so to tom's point, it still would be a hit to the advertising, no doubt, but we feel a lot better about the other sources of what revenue and being stickier and less cyclical in the event of a downturn.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah. and you've been following us for a long period of time. and if you go back for the great recession and you looked at the national media group, the consumer side of the business, it was rock solid. we had -- we offer a lot of value to consumers at a very reasonable subscription price and we saw no fall-off in one of the worst economic times to pile on joe's point.
jason bazinet -- citi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
thanks, jason.

your next question comes from the line of marci ryvicker with wolfe research. your line is open.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
good morning.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
a couple of questions on local and then on national. first is on the local segment. can you talk about net retrans margins going forward now that you've signed fox and cox and comcast. are they relatively similar or are you expecting them to trend down over time?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
marci, i'm looking at where we're at today and where we expect to be out kind of a year, and i think we're pretty stable. and what we're renewing is in line with where we're at and we're kind of in that net -- mid to high 40% that we're keeping.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and are most of your reverse agreements the percent of retrans or a program (inaudible) or is it a combination?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
it's a combination. it's moving more toward a -- i'll call it an annual programming fee and getting away from a per sub rate.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and then can you give some color on the auto category for the current year? i know there's a lot of noise in the super bowl and last year's olympics, but any visibility on this category, either for the current quarter or even for the rest of the year?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
patrick, maybe i'll bring you in here to give some color on the automotive category as you see it.
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
yes, look, what we saw in the recent quarter was that auto was -- domestic was down less than 4 and dealer spending was up slightly though during the quarter. so i think what we're seeing is again cyclical, not systemic, mostly off by the manufacturing piece.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just generally speaking, when you provide guidance for the current quarter, how much of your business is booked, both for national and for local?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
on the national side, our business has changed a little bit because we've got weekly, as specifically people, which represents a large share of the advertising revenue. so usually, we're about two weeks out -- two to three weeks out with people. so it's changed fairly drastically when we used to look at the -- at the net of -- the legacy meredith's perspective. so we've closed when the issues that we have involved with our fiscal third quarter, our february, march and april issues, our monthlies, our february and march issues are closed, and we're currently right in the mix of working in closing on our april issues. so we do have a -- we got a ways to go on people.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
on the local media group side...
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
and what about in local?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yeah, local media group side, i would say about...
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
i'm trying to remember our pacing...
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
i was going to say, patrick, do you have a number on the pacing? is is about 60%(ph), 70%(ph)?
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
yeah, that's about right, that's right.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
and on digital, which is not an insignificant amount of advertising now, in the national media group, digital represents over $400 million. we're booking -- we book ads within two days. so we've still got a ways to go from a digital perspective also.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. just want to make for local, did you say 70% or 60%?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
hang on marci, we're pulling that. we get our pacing every friday, we're pulling up the friday email. we're 85% booked through last friday for our third quarter.
marci ryvicker -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
thank you. and your next question comes from the line of craig huber with huber research partners. your line is open.
patrick mccreery -- president-local media group
yeah, hi, i have a follow-up question. on the -- on your cost savings target of the 550, can you give us what that annualized number was please at the end of december, if you could? do you know what it is going to be at the end of march and end of june? what's the sort of cadence?
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
i don't have it by quarter, craig. i think as we've talked about before, because broadly, we had about $50 million that hit in fiscal '18 this year by the end of the year, we think we'll be at a run rate of -- have another 350 and that would carry about 150 into our fiscal '19. i don't have it broken down by quarter.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
okay. and then also, i know you said it's preliminary here, and you had that long term aspirational target of $1 billion guidance for the whole company for ebitda for fiscal 2020? but just to be clear here, obviously...
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
as i stated, craig, we...
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst
i'm just curious, to be the -- one you hit here of course is extra invest -- potential investment spending and trying to bring in time, inc. that's obviously -- but big unknown here, i just want to be clear on that point, right?
thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
yes, as we're going -- investment spending is a question for next year. we're just entering our budget cycle as we kind of entered the end of our fiscal year and we're going to go to our board and decide what we're going to set for next year as we look at our business. but longer term, our stated goal of $1 billion of ebitda will be in sight in the next 18 to 24 months, if not sooner. and we're always balancing short term goals against longer-term targets of growing our business, and investing for sustainable growth.
joe ceryanec -- chief financial officer
yes, i guess i'd just pile on, craig. as we look, we're just now entering, all our groups are coming in, and we're doing strategic plans, we go to our board in may a budget and our three-year plan. and to tom's point, it's a balance of ringing every last dollar of cost versus investing in the business. and the question we're going to be getting in six months is how you're going to grow the top line? and that's really what the focus is now is how do we get back to organic revenue growth. so that won't be a balance and again, we're not -- that's still our goal, but we'll guide at the end of the calendar year, where we think fiscal 2020 will be.
craig huber -- huber research partners -- analyst

thomas harty -- president, chief executive officer, director
