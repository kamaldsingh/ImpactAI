jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yes, thank you, lori. good morning, everyone. with this morning's release of the results for the second quarter in the six months ended june 30th, 2019. we were pleased to report earnings per share from continuing operations are up 30.4% for the second quarter and 11.5% for the first six months of this year. for the second quarter, revenue grew by 1.2%, and for the six months, revenue was up by 1.4%. within these growth rates, it's important to note that our core recurring lines of businesses within both practice groups continue to perform quite well.
as we had outlined earlier this year, there are several factors that cause the year-over-year revenue comparisons in the first half of this year to reflect more modest growth over the extraordinary levels that we achieved a year ago. first, as you may recall, several of our non-core project oriented businesses recorded unusually high revenue in the first and second quarters of 2018, while these businesses are performing well again this year, the revenue contributions are more in line with historic results.
next, we also knew that there would be an unfavorable impact on revenue as a result of the divestiture of the two small financial services businesses that we announced earlier this year. well, those businesses were not material contributors to the full year revenue results. they did have a larger relative contribution in the first half of 2018.
finally, there is also some variability in contingent carrier commissions that we receive within our benefits and insurance group each year. these payments are based on a variety of mostly unpredictable factors, and we experienced a reduction in the amount of contingent carrier commissions that we received in the first half of this year compared with the same period a year ago. so, it's important to understand that the impact of these several items may cloud the solid performance of the more recurring businesses within our financial services and our benefits and insurance group.
now, turning to some specific comments within our two primary practice groups, within our financial services group, total revenue increased by 1.7% in the second quarter and 2.2% for the first six months of this year, of this revenue growth same unit revenue grew by 2.1% for the second quarter and 2.4% for the first six months. adjusted to eliminate the impact of our project oriented real estate advisory business that had an unusually high revenue contribution in the first half of 2018, the same unit revenue growth for this group was 3.3% in the quarter and 3.4% for the first six months of this year. performance of our core accounting and tax business and our government healthcare consulting business remains very strong.
as we noted on our first quarter call, our first six month revenue reflects the ongoing residual impact from delays and work associated with the tax reform act. as a result, the number of tax filings extensions is up by approximately 10% this year. that work, which is normally performed in the first and second quarters, is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
our private equity advisory business, which is also a project oriented, has historically grown at very high rates that are in excess of 10% in recent years, but did experience some softness in its primary service offering during the second quarter. that slowdown appears to be the result of a decline in the number of private equity transactions reported in the first half of this year. despite some softness in the top line growth, the margin performance of this business remains very strong and the volume of private equity deals appears to be increasing.
turning to our benefits and insurance group, total revenue declined by 0.9% in the second quarter and by 1.1% for the first six months of this year. same unit revenue declined by 1.6% in the quarter and 2.4% for the first six months. we expected a difficult first half revenue comparisons as a result of the unusually high revenue contribution from a number of our project oriented businesses in the first half of last year.
in addition, as mentioned earlier, contingent commission revenues for the first six months of this year trailed the amounts received for the same period last year. we are continuing to make investments to increase the number of new business producers within this group. this is a multi-year process and we'll take some time to materially impact organic revenue growth, but the early returns are very favorable. this year, we have hired 30 new producers within our employee benefits segment alone and we expect to continue to add -- to those numbers through the remainder of the year. in addition, new business production within our benefits and insurance group in the first half of this year is very strong and when coupled with higher client retention rates, we expect improved growth rates in the second half of this year.
so, with those comments let me turn it over to ware grove, our chief financial officer. ware?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thank you, jerry. and good morning, everyone. as jerry described, as we went into this year, there were known headwinds in our ability to reflect the higher rate of revenue growth in the first half this year. if you normalize to eliminate the impact of these non-recurring items a year ago, including the year-over-year impact of the divestitures, the second quarter revenue growth was an adjusted 2.9% and for the six months the adjusted revenue growth was 3.1%. despite the modest revenue growth reported in the first half, we are extremely pleased to report higher margin with growth in earnings per share at the high end of our expectations. a portion of what is normally the first half tax service revenue will now come in the second half this year. new business production and client retention trends are very positive within our benefits and insurance services group.
as a result, we expect second half revenue growth rates will accelerate and we think our growth in earnings per share for the full year will be near the high end of our 10% to 12% of growth range. in addition to the three acquisitions we have announced to date this year, we have continued to use capital for share repurchases. in the second quarter we repurchased a total of approximately 422,000 shares of our common stock, and for the six months we have repurchased a total of approximately 1 million shares at a total cost of approximately $19.9 million.
as a result of this first half activity, we are now reducing our estimated full year weighted average share count to within a range of 55.5 million to 56 million shares. cash flow is on track for the first six months and adjusted ebitda for the first half is up by 8.3% to $86.5 billion or 17.1% of revenue, up from 16% a year ago. at june 30th, we had an outstanding balance borrowed of $159 million on our $400 million unsecured credit facility, and the leverage when compared with ebitda was approximately 1.5 times and that results in $229.2 million of unused borrowing capacity, and we will continue to actively evaluate share repurchases as a use of capital.
in the first half this year we used approximately $13.1 million for acquisitions, including payments for earn outs on previously closed transactions. we project the use of approximately $18.1 million for the remainder of this year; $11.5 million in 2020; $5.1 million in 2021; and approximately 2.7 million in 2022. day sales outstanding on receivables stood at 90 days at june 30th this year, and that compares with 87 days at june a year ago. a small increase in this measure can be attributed to the tax filing extensions as a portion of the billings for tax work has not yet been processed.
capital spending for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 million, and for the six months it was approximately $6.9 million. this reflects spending on facility, tenant improvements associated with lease renewals and moves, plus our transition from leasing to purchasing some routine it equipment replacements. full year capital spending is expected at approximately $12 million. at june 30th this year there is approximately $100 million held in our deferred compensation plan. this is reflected as both an asset and an equal liability on our balance sheet.
as we account for the gains and losses on these investment assets, most of you already know there is no impact to our pre-tax income, but eliminating the impact of accounting for gains and losses on operating income, second quarter margin was 9.9%, compared with 8.5% a year ago and for the six months, the adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, compared with 14.2% a year ago. the effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3% and for the six months the effective tax rate was 25.9%.
we continue to project a full year effective tax rate of approximately 25%. the effective tax rate could either be higher or lower as the impact of accounting for stock compensation or the balance of the year is unpredictable.
for the six months this year, we reported a significant increase in the pre-tax income margin to 14.5% from 13.1%, an increase of 140 basis points compared with last year. now, a portion of this 140 basis points improvement is due to the non-recurring nature of the share price related mark-to-market charge of $2.8 million that was reported for the six months a year ago. the non-recurring charge accounts for about 60 basis points of this improvement, so there is another 80 basis points of improved margin that is being driven by operating efficiencies and leveraging expenses. we are continuing to make investments in the business as jerry commented, including the marketing and media spend in the first half this year, plus the new producer investment spending within our benefits and insurance group.
even with these investments, we are very pleased to see the results of pricing and other cost initiatives within our business that are now resulting in margin improvement. as jerry commented, our core business is steady and is performing in line with expectations. new business production and client retention measures are very positive to date this year. so to recap, our full year expectations are that first of all, we expect a higher rate of revenue growth in the second half this year, but considering the seasonal nature of our first half versus second half revenue mix at this midpoint in the year, we're looking for full year revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%.
as we commented earlier, the performance of the business is very good. we are pleased to report margin improvement in the first half with eps up by 11.5% and we are looking to full year growth and earnings per share near the high end of our range of 10% to 12% growth for the full year. our full year effective tax rate is expected at approximately 25%, but this could be either higher or lower for the reasons i explained earlier. with a first half impact of the shares we purchase today, we're expecting a full year fully diluted share count within a range of 55.5 million to 56 million shares, and that's a reduction from the 56.5 to 57 shares we initially forecasted earlier this year.
so with these comments, i will conclude and will now turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i just want to spend a couple of minutes talking about acquisitions and our outlook for the rest of the year. turning to acquisitions, so far this year we've welcomed three new companies to our cbiz team bringing total full year revenue of approximately $10.5 million, although only a portion of that amount will impact 2019 results. among them, we ended a strong group of tax practitioners to our growing denver, colorado, accounting practice. with the addition of the winner group in the first quarter.
on july 1st, we also announced two additional acquisitions. paytime, located here in northeast ohio, brings talent and increased expertise relating to our new software platform to our growing payroll business and gavion located in memphis, tennessee brings an outstanding team of advisors and other professionals to our retirement plan services group with specific expertise with alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds. we're excited to have these teams joining our cbiz family. our pipeline of prospective acquisitions candidates remained strong and we've plenty of capacity to close deals with over $225 million of available funds on our $400 million credit facility.
now turning to our outlook for the -- remainder of the year, while the second half of our year was more heavily reliant on discretionary project-oriented work, the level of optimism among small and middle market business owners and executives remains near record highs, albeit, somewhat tempered compared to the first quarter and certainly 2018. and our offices are generally optimistic about the prospects for the remainder of the year.
at this point, i'll turn it over for questions-and-answers.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from jim macdonald of first analysis. please proceed.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
good morning, jim.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hi, jim.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
yeah, i just want to clarify where you -- you said that the growth would've been 2.9%, adjusted for -- was that adjusted for the divestiture and one-time items or just for the divestiture?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks jim. for the divestiture plus i'll call it the extraordinary year-over-year comparison on those transactional businesses. so it's about a 1.7% adjustment when you take those transactional business and normalize those and include the divestitures.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and it sounds positive with your increased benefit advisor activity. do you expect the benefits group to go positive in terms of growth later this year?
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yeah, jim. we think that this is going to start to turn really going into the third and fourth quarters, although as we had indicated early in the year, i think for the year relatively flat, but i think you'll see directional improvement in organic growth third and fourth quarters.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
great. and we haven't talked about it for a while but you just bought a payroll related company. tell us your general thoughts on that business and what your plans are for the payroll business.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yeah, we like the payroll business, too. i think it is, particularly in our environment with our clients who provide us with an opportunity to bring real value to those clients and part of that approach is the ability to bring not only payroll, but to combine it with technology, and combine it with our benefits -- employee benefits offering in a package that many of the others in the market just aren't providing. so we like the business in general this specific acquisition allowed us to do two things they have a nice table of clients. they also were very familiar with this new software. they also shared the same platform, software platforms that we use in our core business and so they -- they had a bit of a jump-start for us on using the new platform that we recently added to our portfolio. so we expect to be able to leverage their expertise in that -- with that platform. so it kind of lined up in a lot of different ways for us.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and just one more for me. so you're opex was a bit lower, leading to obviously better margins than i expected. are you having -- what's accounting for that -- are you having trouble, hiring or maintaining producers in this economic climate?
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
no. it's funny, we keep reading the headlines. everybody else is reading about tight labor market. and we certainly are seeing some of that -- not specifically, i don't think on the -- on the producer side as much as in some of the other areas of our business, but we've made pretty considerable investments in our recruiting both out-of-college and in lateral hire recruiting and so we've been able to fill our pipeline to meet our needs on the recruiting side. so, real no -- really no significant impact from the hiring pressures that are in the market.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
so is there any -- what's the explanation for this sort of lower operating expenses?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, jim, it's just a combination of expense controls on the benefits and insurance side and staffing levels it's a result of higher rates of utilization on the financial services side. and combined with some, what we'll call, offshoring initiatives. and the third thing, i think, that we've talked about in the past is we've really focused on pricing and yield. and so it's a combination of both expenses and pricing that gets us the margin improvement.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay, thanks a lot.
operator
our next question comes from tim mchugh of william blair and company. please proceed.
tim mchugh -- william blair and company -- analyst
thanks. i guess, just following up a little bit on the last one. i guess, as we think forward to a year from now, will we be looking back at this period talking about how this is an unusually strong margin performance, or are there some sort of kind of unusual factors, kind of like now we're looking back at revenue right and it's a tough comp, i guess, just trying to understand the sustainability of the improvement in margin that you've shown this year and as we think forward to the future.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, tim this is ware. no, i don't think we will understand that the first half this year within the expense structure, we have some incremental marketing and media campaign expenses. we also have some incremental investments which will continue both programs, marketing and investment producers will continue. but i don't think we'll look back at this as an extraordinarily high watermark.
tim mchugh -- william blair and company -- analyst
okay, great. and then healthcare, i didn't -- if you just talked about it, i missed it, but within the financial services, how is the healthcare piece doing for you guys?
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
the government healthcare consulting this, yes, i'm sorry tim, yeah, very strong continues to perform very, very strong for us, as it has for many years.
tim mchugh -- william blair and company -- analyst
okay, great. that's all i had. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from chris moore of cjs securities. please proceed.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities inc -- analyst
this is stefanos crist calling for chris. good morning.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
good morning.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities inc -- analyst
back to m&a, so you mentioned the three deals this year. how is pricing on these compared to other acquisitions in the last three to four years?
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yes, if you recall prior conversations on this, what we've -- what we've said is that pricing in certain segments of our businesses, particularly on the insurance brokerage side, property and casualty benefit side continues to tick up and is quite high at this point. these three acquisitions, one was a -- an accounting office tax practice, one was a payroll, one was in rps. we actually signaled, i think earlier that we've receiving far less price pressure in those areas, so we're really looking at areas of our business where we see great strategic fit, where we see growth opportunities and where we believe that we can be competitive in our pricing and still provide reasonable returns back to the shareholders, and we found them in these three areas, and we believe that, that market exists in a lot of other areas as well. so we have a -- as i indicated, a very attractive pipeline of transactions of the character that you saw in the -- so far this year. as well as some larger ones that were -- we're still looking at as well.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities inc -- analyst
got it. thanks. and can you also talk a little bit more about a free cash flow expectations for this year versus last year?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, ebitda is up, that's a good barometer. it's not exactly translates to free cash flow, but if you look at our net income in any given year, you can probably add back another $0.30 to $0.35 effectively on a per share basis to get an indicative free cash flow. and that comes from the noncash charges led by depreciation, amortization, which is the largest, plus other non-cash charges, minus of course, the capital spending, which is $10 million to $12 million. hopefully that's enough, it goes up and down in any given year, depending on accrued compensation and other expenses that can be a bit variable year-over-year but i think that's a good way to think about it.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities inc -- analyst
all right, thanks guys.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from marc riddick of sidoti & company. please proceed.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, good morning.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
good morning marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i'm wondering if you could touch a little bit on the commentary around the -- what you're seeing as far as, i think you said it was about a 10% filing extension rate. and sort of maybe if you could give us a little more color on what that provides as far as maybe how you're seeing? how that might play out as far as our contribution -- potential contributions into the third or fourth -- or is it mostly going to be going into the third quarter do you believe or did you get a general sense that some of that might end up bleeding into the fourth quarter? and then i have a couple of follow ups on that.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yes. so mark, i think it's probably third and fourth quarter, if you think about an october 15th kind of filing deadline date, right. so some of it'll be in the both of those periods of time and as we indicated in the first quarter, it's really as a result of the delays in the guidance that was provided relative to the new tax reform act impacted not only us but the entire industry as well as the software providers to the industry that, that have the code based on that guidance, right? so all of those things contributed to an incremental number of extensions this year compared to prior periods or prior years and we think that there -- and we're seeing it -- we're seeing it in the number of extensions, that work has to get done really in part third quarter and i think in small part, fourth quarter as well.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, its helpful. and then i was wonder if you could touch a little bit on just -- as a reminder of the advertising campaign sort of what you did last year versus what you planned doing this year and how we might think about -- how that might impact timing of rollout and expenses and that type of thing.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yeah. so, marc, we budgeted this year about the same amount of money that we budgeted last year, but we'll get more impact from it this year for two reasons. first of all, last year, in addition to just the airtime that we paid for, we had to pay for the design and the production of the campaign. we're taking those dollars and rolling them into airtime, right. so what you saw last year was a larger expense in the second half, because we really -- i believe air -- started to air those advertisements really in the end of the third quarter and mostly the fourth quarter of last year. this year were more evenly distributed. so we've taken the same dollars, front-ended them so that we're evenly split really first half, second half.
so i think from this point forward, what you'll see is a continuation of -- about the same amount of spend only more evenly spread kind of throughout the quarters, throughout the year.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, ok. that makes a lot of sense. and then i guess, i wanted to sort of touch on if there was any particular regional areas of strength and weakness any particular call outs that you saw during the quarter that would be worth going over? just wanted to see if there's anything like that. thank you.
jerome grisko -- president chief executive officer
yeah. not that would give us any directional guidance, of course, in any -- in any given period, some of our offices perform stronger than others, but i can't -- it's attributed -- we can't attribute it and kind of looking at the results to any trends that are specific to a geographic region or a profile of a type of client. so if you step way back the business and looked at the quarterly results and the annual results, we are very pleased, as we indicated with the results that we're receiving from our core tax and accounting, our core benefits insurance, our government healthcare consulting and really kind of the comparative anomaly has to do with the more projects oriented businesses in the way they performed in the first half of 2018 compared to this year.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, and then last one for me, i was kind of thinking about with the announced acquisitions and i think you gave a run rate numbers, i was kind of thinking about as you look at the back half of the year and the revenue growth. if you can sort of -- give us sort of a ballpark of how you're thinking about the contributions between organic versus acquisition contributions. thanks.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, marc. this is ware. as it was in the first half, most of the growth this year is coming from organic sources and the organic sources for all the reasons we outlined, we expect to accelerate from the first half growth rate. the acquisition impact this year to the total revenue growth rate is fairly nominal. we're happy to make three acquisitions. they're all relatively small and we'll have a relatively minor impact for the full year growth rate on the revenue this year.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.

i'll now turn the call over to jerry for his opening remarks. jerry?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, lori and good morning everyone. with this morning's release of our third quarter and 9 months results ended september 30th, 2019, we are pleased to report that earnings per share from continuing operations was up by 33.3% for the third quarter and was up by 16.2% for the first 9 months of this year. for the third quarter, total revenue was up by 6.9% and for the nine months revenue grew by 3.1%.
of this revenue growth, same unit revenue represented 5.6% in the third quarter and 3.1% for the first 9 months. the growth in revenue in the third quarter reflects continued strong demand for our core recurring services offered through both our financial services and our benefits in insurance groups, as well as strong contributions from our number of our more project oriented businesses.
consistent with the expectations that we outlined at the end of the second quarter, revenue growth has accelerated over the first half of this year, largely as a result of the strong same unit revenue growth that we experienced in the third quarter of this year. we are especially pleased to report 160 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin for the first 9 months, as we leveraged our top line growth to produce a 16.2% increase in earnings per share. we do however expect our full-year pre-tax margin to be somewhat lower than our current year-to-date margin, as a result of a number of planned investments in the fourth quarter, intended to fuel the future growth of the business.
even with these investments, we expect to be near to high end of our full year guidance of 10% to 12% growth in earnings per share. we continue to actively pursue potential strategic acquisitions. to date this year, we've closed six acquisitions, which net of divestitures contributed $3.1 million to third quarter revenue and $4.3 million to revenue for the first 9 months.
over the past 12 months, we have closed seven transactions with annualized revenue contribution of approximately $19.4 million. turning to the performance of our financial services group, total revenue increased by 5.2% in the third quarter and by 3.1% for the first nine months. same unit revenue growth for that period -- for the third quarter was 5.1% and 3.2% for the 9 month period.
performance of our core accounting and tax business remained strong. as anticipated tax work that had been delayed due to tax reform was largely completed in the third quarter and we expect some modest residual amount to occur in the fourth quarter as well. revenue growth in our government healthcare consulting business is in the mid single-digit range for the first 9 months of this year, as occurs in this business from time to time, administrative delays of slowed work over several engagements this year in growth is slightly below our historic rates for the first 9 months.
we expect the delays to be cleared later this year and the normal pace of work under these contracts to resume. even with these delays, the business continues to perform very well and we have a robust pipeline of potential new projects that will continue to drive future growth within this business line. our private equity business was one of our fastest growing service lines over the past 2 years and finished 2018 at record levels. we are pleased that this year the business has been able to achieve the approximate revenue levels recorded last year, although it has not experienced top line growth beyond those levels.
however, even with relatively flat top line, this business has been able to achieve a substantial improvement in its pre-tax contribution. although the nature of the business is such that we have a narrow window into client demand for these services, the pipeline of future projects appears to be improving and we continue to experience high growth rates in a number of the service lines within this business.
turning to our benefits and insurance group. as we commented at the end of the second quarter, improving client retention coupled with strong first half new business production led us to expect stronger revenue growth rates in the second half of this year compared with the first half results. consistent with those expectations, total revenue within our benefits and insurance group increased by 9.8% in the third quarter and same unit revenue increased by 5.8% in that period.
third quarter revenue was enhanced by project work that we do not expect to recur at the same levels in the fourth quarter. for the first nine months, total revenue within this group increased by 2.4% with same unit revenue growing 8.2%. within our payroll business, we are in the early stages of introducing our large client human capital management platform to the market and the reception has been very positive.
while our core payroll platform continues to perform very well for small to mid size clients with less robust needs, we see significant opportunity to serve larger more complex clients with our new integrated payroll and hcm product offering, supported by our advanced technology platform.
so with these comments, let me turn it over to ware grove, our cfo.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, jerry and good morning everyone. our third quarter results were very strong. for the nine months, we are pleased to be able to leverage our top line growth into a 16.2% growth in earnings per share. as jerry outlined, there will be further investment spending in the fourth quarter and our full year expectation for earnings per share continues to be near the higher end of our full-year growth of 10% to 12% over the prior year.
cash flow performance for the business continues to be very strong. adjusted ebitda is up by 13.1% for the 9 months to $117.9 million from $104.3 million a year ago. at september 30th, we had borrowed $160 million on our $400 million unsecured credit facility. this results in leverage of approximately 1.4 times ebitda, with $234 million of unused finance, financing capacity.
our first priority for the use of capital is to make strategic acquisitions. to date this year, we have closed six transactions that will contribute approximately $17.4 million of annualized revenue and over the past twelve months, we have closed seven transactions that will contribute approximately $19.4 million of annualized revenue.
through september 30th this year, spending on acquisitions including the payment of earn-outs on previously closed acquisitions is approximately $37.1 million. over the remainder of this year, we expect to use an additional $1.2 million for earn-out payments on prior acquisitions. for 2020, we expect to use approximately $16.2 million and for 2021 approximately $8.6 million and then for 2022 approximately $5.8 million for earn-outs on previous acquisitions.
we do have plenty of financing capacity to pursue strategic acquisitions and we always have a full pipeline of potential acquisitions under review. we have the capacity and flexibility and we'll also continue to evaluate the use of cash for share repurchases. through september 30th, we have repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $21 million.
we continue to project a fully diluted weighted average share count within a range of 55.5 million to 56 million shares for the full year this year. day sales outstanding on receivables stood at 93 days as september 30 this year, compared with 87 days a year earlier. the increase this year is largely driven by invoicing activities that are associated with a number of tax extensions that we dealt with earlier this year. as is our normal seasonal pattern, we expect the day sales outstanding will reduce significantly by the end of the year as client payments are received on outstanding receivables.
capital spending at cbiz is largely driven by facility related tenant improvements that are associated with lease renewals or moves plus some maintenance level of it-related purchases. for the 9 months ended september 30th, capital spending was approximately $10.3 million and for the full year we estimate spending within a range of $12 million to $15 million. capital spending in the third quarter was approximately $3.4 million.
now adjusting reported results to eliminate the impact of accounting for gains or losses on the assets held in our deferred compensation plan, for the 9 months ended september 30th, the adjusted operating income margin was 13.6% compared with 12.4% a year ago. as always the footnotes in the earnings release outline the components for these adjustments. the effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.2% and for the 9 months this year, the effective tax rate was 25.7%.
at this point, we continue to estimate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 25%. however, as a reminder, the effective tax rate is impacted by the accounting for stock compensation expense. and this can be either higher or lower than our estimate depending on a number of unpredictable variables. looking toward the balance of the year, fourth quarter is more dependent upon project work and therefore can be more difficult to estimate. plus as jerry commented, we expect to incur additional spending on strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter. considering these factors, we expect growth in earnings per share for the full year to be near the higher end of a range of a growth 10% to 12% over the prior year.
our core business is healthy and is performing very well. to reiterate our guidance at mid-year, we expected the second half growth rate in revenue to be greater than the first half growth rate. the third quarter was particularly strong, aided by the early timing of second half project work in several business units. with nine months revenue growth at 3.1% compared with the prior year, we continue to expect full-year revenue growth within a range of 3% to 4%.
our full-year effective tax rate as i commented earlier is expected at approximately 25%. and again, this could be either higher or lower for the reasons i outlined earlier. with the impact of the share repurchase activity to date, we are expecting fully diluted weighted average share count within a range of 55.5 million to 56 million shares for the full year this year.
so with these comments, i will conclude. and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i thought i'd spend a couple of minutes just providing little bit more color on a couple of areas of the business. our third quarter numbers reflect early returns in a number of key investments that we've made over the past couple of years to fuel the future growth of the business. by way of example, within our core accounting practice, we've made substantial investments in training, systems and tools that allow our office leaders and practitioners to be more data driven, resulting in better management of productivity revenue and profitability of client engagements.
we've also built an internal team that works with each of our offices to optimize the use of these tools and processes, the support expanded resources that we are now providing to our offices have been very well received and enable us to make more informed decisions in the management in pricing of client engagements. in addition, we're pleased to see continued positive results from the investments that we've made to increase the number of producers with our benefits and insurance group. while it will take some number of years for the production of our recent hires to match the productivity of our more seasoned producers, the trend line is encouraging and the collective efforts of our new producer group are already beginning to contribute to our organic revenue growth rates.
now turning to acquisitions. in the third quarter, we welcomed five new acquisitions to our cbiz family. in addition to paytime and gavion which we discussed on our second quarter call, on august 1st we added qba benefits located in westlake, ohio and ericson cpas located in san luis obispo, california. qba is an employee benefit firm serving small and middle-market businesses. qba has an outstanding reputation and significantly enhances our benefits in insurance service offerings here in northeast ohio. ericsson cpa strengthened our team of top quality tax professional serving our clients in california. in addition, brinig taylor zimmer located in san diego, california joined us on september 1st. btz brings a depth of expertise in forensic accounting, litigation consulting and business valuation services that complements our existing service offerings in that market, while adding important capacity in these high demand areas.
while each of the companies that have joined us has addressed an important strategic opportunity for us and we're pleased with the number of transactions that we've completed. the annual revenue of these firms does not entirely represent the size of many of the transactions that we've reviewed and pursued. we continue to focus on acquisitions as a meaningful way to grow our business and we have a robust pipeline of deals both large and small and the capacity on hand to evaluate these deals thoroughly and efficiently.
we've expanded our m&a team over the past 18 months and refined our approach to be more strategic and aggressive in the deals that we pursue. we remain most interested in acquiring firms that bring strategic capacity and expertise, as well as demonstrated strong cultural alignment and fit. i am confident in how we're positioned ourselves in terms of having the ability to invest being attractive to potential acquisition targets and being competitive in the market. as ware said, we have plenty of capacity to close deals with over $234 million of funds on our $400 million facility.
so at this point, i'll close and turn it over for ",".

[operator instructions] our first question comes from jim macdonald with first analysis.
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
hey, jim.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hey, jim
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
yeah. so you talked about some transactional advantages on the tax side in accounting, was there anything else in accounting? and what was the nature of the transactional items and benefits that helped you?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
so a couple of things, jim. encouragingly from on the tax and accounting side, we saw steady and consistent increase in revenue from the most of our larger offices. and so when we see that that's a signal for high demand for the core services kind of across the board, across industries across our client base. as far as the transaction businesses within benefits and insurance, it was really a mix. our transaction services, so our compensation and executive search did very well. we happen to have high, high project work out of our retirement plan services. so there was really a number of areas that performed very well there, our real estate advisory practice within our financial services group also had a strong quarter
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
so it wasn't the benefit bonuses this quarter?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
no.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
no, nothing like that.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
no real impact from contingent commissions.
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and you mentioned government consulting has been sort of mid-single digits for the year, is that similar in the third quarter?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think across the board kind of mid single digit this year. as you know, we typically perform couple of hundred basis points higher than that and it's really just been delays in some sizable contracts.
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and then you talked about some investment spend in the fourth quarter, could you give us some more details about that and then i'll let someone else ask.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah again, i would say there was a number of categories there including our branding campaign. we just finished a flight recently that's in the fourth quarter, there'll be spend associated with that. i also mentioned the investment that we've been making in our what we call our office practice management, office on our financial services side to provide better visibility and tools and processes around pricing and client profitability where we're continuing to make investments in that area. and those are -- those are two of the areas, but there are a number of others.
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
right. maybe just sneak in any -- can you give us an order of magnitude of what that -- what the investment cost will be in the fourth quarter?
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, jim, i think we're signaling that there will be some impact in the fourth quarter and without getting too detailed about it, with the margin up as it is today, you're going to see a little bit of a compression on a full year basis for the 12 months versus the 9 months. so...
james robert macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. thanks.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah.
operator
our next question comes from andrew nicholas with william blair.
trevor romeo -- william blair -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is actually trevor romeo in for andrew. thank you for taking the call. first question would just be, some -- the margin performance was very strong again this quarter. just wondering kind of what are the most important factors driving the magnitude of that improvement. and how much of your internal productivity and efficiency initiative is helping?
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, andrew, this is ware. it's a number of things, we're commenting on the strategic initiatives and the things we're investing in the business. this has been ongoing for a couple of years. so the good news to us is we are gaining traction and seeing more leverage in the business. we commonly talk about 20 to 50 basis points a year over a long period of time. and in some years we're more in an investment mode, in other years we get -- reap the benefits of that. so while we are continuing to invest, we're also gaining traction and it's just the utilization and the back office efficiencies and a number of things that are just trying -- are starting to gain traction for us.
trevor romeo -- william blair -- analyst
okay, great. and then could you just give us an update on your progress with cross-serving, particularly interested in what kind of success you're seeing -- selling the core accounting services to benefits clients and vice versa?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, trevor, it's jerry grisko. what i would say is our cross serving activity this year is consistent with what it's been, how we performed over the past number of years. we do not see as much activity going back and forth between our financial services group and our benefits and insurance group. we see more activity within the group. so by way of example, if -- within our benefits and insurance group, it's not uncommon for us to first procure a payroll client and then work on procuring a broker of record on our benefits and insurance side and then potentially 401(k).
so, a full suite of services around the hr department, but probably not going down the hall, we're not often enough going down the hall and also getting work from the cfo's office. so we're -- it's more synergistic where we're within the cfo, department of the cfo, the cfo's office or controller office we sell multiple financial services products and within the hr suite, we typically sell more related products there as well.
trevor romeo -- william blair -- analyst
okay, got it. i guess do you see -- do you see that as kind of a long-term opportunity to increase the cross-serving across the segments at all?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, it's -- it's important to us on a number of fronts. first of all, it's -- it's embedded in our culture, it's the way that we go to market. we have -- we have through our crm system identified each of our clients that are -- that are more susceptible, are more attractive from a cross-serving perspective. we have active client stewardship meetings around those clients. we talk about where we provide services where some of our services are -- while some of our competitors may be providing services. and we have active -- active plans around introducing additional services to all of the clients that are most -- most attractive in that way. so it's important to us, culturally it's important to us the way we distinguish ourselves in the market, for those clients that are receiving multiple services, there is a higher retention rate and also a higher satisfaction rate. so it is -- it's important to us on a lot of fronts.
trevor romeo -- william blair -- analyst
okay, got it, thanks. and maybe just one more, if you could maybe just expand a little on your broad view of the small mid-size business environment you see right now, just from a macro and business confidence perspective, maybe their willingness to spend on discretionary products or services right now?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so let's kind of level set here. we are -- over the past couple of years at all time record high levels of confidence among smb. with that said, they can't help, but be influenced by the headlines that we're all reading in the papers and hearing on the news around tariffs and other uncertainty, both in the global markets and on the national stage. they are also by the way most influenced by what's happening in their own local economies and in their state economies and if you -- if you -- if you cascade that kind of most interested and most confident what's going on locally and their confidence level goes down as they -- as they move beyond those international and global market.
so what we're seeing is still strong optimism among our clients which is smb in their own local economies and strong confidence in their own businesses albeit heightened caution around the short, mid-term and certainly longer-term prospects for the national and global economy. and what that's translating into is really a mixed bag and certain industries and in certain markets, we see greater growth, but i think it's tempered growth over what we've experienced a year ago at this time and certainly two years ago at that -- at this time.
trevor romeo -- william blair -- analyst
okay, great. that makes a lot of sense. all right, well thank you very much for the color there.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question comes from chris moore with cjs securities.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is stefanos crist calling for chris.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
hi, stefanos. how are you? it's jerry.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
good. just wanted to talk a little about m&a. so could you walk me through the math, roughly how much additional revenue would you guys need to acquire over the next few months to generate 3% or 4% revenue growth from m&a in 2020?
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
the wraparound is what you're talking about. so, year-to-date $17.4 million, but some of that's already done and it won't incrementally increase by that amount. so you do the math at, i'll just say approximately $950 million of revenue, you need $27 million to $30 million of net new revenue on a wraparound. so -- so we'd have to do a considerable more to get that 3% target as an increase -- incremental increase next year versus this year from m&a alone, if that's your question.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
yeah. got it, thanks. and you guys also said there's a full pipeline, how big is that pool of potential candidates, is it dozens of companies -- hundreds, what would you say?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
well, it's an interesting question depends on how you break it down. i will say that we have -- we have -- we have looked at over 100 companies so far this year. and that's not to say we put ndas in on each of those and certainly haven't gone down the path on a lot of those. so, the pipeline is i would say consistent with the pipeline that we've had over the past several years. there are a mix of larger acquisitions in that pipeline, mid-size acquisitions and smaller acquisitions. and then our ability to get the type of growth that we target year-over-year is largely dependent on how those transactions work their way through the pipeline and as you can appreciate, it's very difficult to predict.
this year, we're pleased with the number. we wish the revenue contribution was higher, but we've really brought on board some very high quality organizations with terrific cultural fits. we're excited to have them on board. there are a number of larger transactions that we pursue that for a number of reasons did not get done this year, some of them may come back. there are some others that are still in the pipeline. so, if we're fortunate to get some of those larger transactions done, then i think we'll hit the mark.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. and then just one more quick one, are there any geographies in the us where cbiz is underrepresented and the growth opportunity looks pretty significant?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, we've actually talked about this from time to time, the answer is yes. so for example if you look at the pacific northwest, we're not represented at all there and we really need a presence there. silicon valley underrepresented, the state of texas, strong demographics really underrepresented there, there was a number of other markets and we have a very as you would expect kind of focused effort on those strong demographic markets and an active dialog going on with many of the candidates in those markets.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right, thanks guys. i'll go in the queue.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer

[operator instructions] our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti & company.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, good morning.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
hi, marc.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
good morning.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i wanted to touch on -- go back to a little bit on the -- the investments that you're talking about for the fourth quarter. i was wondering if you could i know you talked a little bit about that, but i wanted to get a sense from a timing perspective, should we think about those types of investments as ones that are maybe more concentrated in the fourth quarter because of being ahead of seasonal activity or do you think that's something that could then move into the early part of next year and then i have a couple of follow-ups.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
marc, it's a combination of things, some of these things are ongoing. for example, the investment in new producers is ongoing, but sometimes the timing of when the hires occur creates kind of a greater year-over-year difference and that will occur in the fourth quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, because we now have more people on board in that layer. we have some marketing spend, which is a bit episodic. we don't do it on a straight-line basis. we tend to do a first half flight and then a second half flight that could be either third or fourth quarter, but this year it will be more in the fourth quarter.
some of the other spending we do have projects and initiatives as jerry commented on kind of the practice management tool chest that we are building has some pricing analysis and tools and we're building a system with the help of an outside consultant to help us. so there will be some spending on that, that we believe will certainly pay back dividends in future years. so it's a combination of things.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. and then i think you'd mentioned this a little bit, but as far as delayed activity that had flowed through the year toward more so in the third quarter, i think you touched a little bit on this that there might be some that still ongoing into the fourth quarter. i was wondering if you could put some color on that and how we should think about that additional maybe slightly off-seasonal activity?
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, so marc, it's jerry. that was really referring to the delayed work from the tax reform act and i won't get into all of the conversation we had about that in the first and second quarter. but suffice it to say that we were expecting more revenue in the first quarter as a result of the -- the traditional and expected level of tax work that we do as a result of some delays there that work that pushed in later in the year. we had signaled early in our most recent call that or the second quarter call that we expected that to occur in the third quarter. it did in fact come in the third quarter based on the number of returns and the revenue impact. so we've seen the vast majority of that. the only comment that i made was, there is some small amount that we would expect to have in the fourth quarter, but it's not material.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and then last one from me for now at least, the commentary around the branding spend. i was wondering if you could touch a little bit on, i guess maybe what it looks like as i mean this time last year you guys had sort of just launched your national television campaign. so i wanted to get a sense of are we looking at ideally spending the same or slightly more, but now that you've got those upfront costs out of the way having more of those dollars just be specifically on the actual ad spend or how should we think about maybe how that how the constitution of those dollars look this year going forward versus last. thanks.
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, marc, that's a great question. first of all the total spend is approximately the same year-over-year, but you're absolutely right. last year, in a start up there was more protection and design work and probably fewer media purchases. this year there is a little more media exposure because we've now invested and we're spending approximately the same dollars, but we're getting more media exposure.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and have you been happy with sort of how that -- where that exposure is played out or have you felt any need to sort of move around like where those dollars go or how should we think about how that message is being conveyed. thanks.
jerome p. grisko -- president & chief executive officer
so, marc, it's jerry. when you talk about where the dollars are going today, it's a broad based campaign. really we spend more money in markets and offices where we have a larger presence, some lesser amount of money in smaller markets, but we are really covering all markets of any significance within cbiz. we would expect that we would continue to have a similar approach going forward. as far as impact is concerned, as you can appreciate these things are long-term investments that show impact over a longer period of time. we do survey the market as the brand awareness periodically. we're in the middle of one of those surveys. now the last time we did it, we did see nice improvements in our brand awareness period-over-period. so we would expect to see continued results of that type when we get the results from this survey as well.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.

jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. with this morning's release of fourth quarter and full year results for 2019, we were pleased to report that earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 16.5% for the full year. that being $1.27 for 2019 compared with $1.09 for the prior year. we also reported 110 basis point improvement in our profit margin and income before tax and total revenue growth of 2.9%. while fourth quarter revenue growth of 2.1% was lower than full year growth, it's important to remember that revenue growth in the third quarter, reported at 6.9%, was much stronger. as we advised at the end of the third quarter, certain project-related work that could have occurred at any time in the second half of the year was completed in the third quarter. and as a result, we expected revenue in the fourth quarter to be somewhat softer. as we've commented many times in the past, revenue in the second half of any year for us is far more dependent on project-oriented work, which, by its very nature, is difficult to predict. so internally, one of the trends that we consider is the rate of growth in the second half of a given year compared to the first half of that same year.
in 2019, for the third and fourth quarters combined, second half revenue grew by 4.6% compared with first half revenue growth of 1.4%. this first half versus second half revenue growth dynamic was driven by several factors. to start, first half revenue in our financial services group was negatively impacted by delays encountered in connection with tax reform. this was largely caught up during the third quarter and was reflected in the stronger revenue growth at that time. and second, as expected, continued investments in our benefits and insurance businesses are continuing to gain momentum, resulting in second half growth from that group being considerably higher than first half growth. our reported same unit revenue numbers for the fourth quarter were impacted by the same issues. fourth quarter same unit revenue growth was 0.1% and full year same unit revenue was up 2%. our second half same unit revenue growth of 3% was considerably higher than our first half growth of 1.2% for the reasons i outlined earlier. adding to our existing operations, we were pleased to announce the closing of six acquisitions throughout 2019.
these newly acquired operations will contribute approximately $17.4 million to our annualized revenue. to date, this year in 2020, we've already closed an additional three acquisitions effective february 1, totaling approximately $6.2 million of annualized revenue. as in the past, we have a long list of potential acquisition candidates that are at various stages of the process, including a number that is somewhat larger than the typical transactions that we've completed in recent years. while it's too early to predict if and when those transactions may close, we have the resources, processes, capacity and desire to increase the number of transactions that we add each year and, if the right opportunities present themselves, the size of those transactions as well. turning to our financial services group. total revenue for the fourth quarter grew by 0.7%, and same unit revenue declined by 0.3%. for the full year, total revenue grew by 2.6%, with same unit revenue up 2.5%. while our core accounting and tax business continues to be very strong and is performing to our expectations, the rate of revenue growth within this group was reduced by lower growth from a number of our national consulting practices, including our government healthcare consulting business and our private equity consulting business.
as we commented in the third quarter, revenue growth within our government healthcare consulting business has historically been in the high single-digit range, but was lower than expected in 2019 due to administrative delays encountered with several large contracts. those contracts have either been signed or we expect them to be signed shortly, and for the work to commence sometime in the first quarter, after which, the rate of growth for this business should return to historic levels. since its formation in 2017, our private equity business has experienced very strong rates of growth. as we also commented at the end of the third quarter, we experienced some softness in demand from one of the primary service offerings within this group, and revenue for the full year of 2019 was essentially flat. during the fourth quarter, we saw demand strengthen and this business now has a stronger pipeline of projects as a result. going into 2020, we expect to achieve stronger revenue growth from this business than we experienced a year ago. despite some softness in revenue within our government healthcare consulting and our private equity services businesses, the leadership teams within those businesses did an outstanding job of managing costs, and we're able to achieve target profit margins. turning to our benefits and insurance group.
revenue for the fourth quarter grew by 3.8%, while same unit revenue declined by 0.2%. for the year, total revenue grew by 2.7% with same unit growth for the full year at 0.1%. this business continues to generate very strong profit margins, and we're continuing to make investments to accelerate top line growth. it's important to note that second half same unit revenue growth improved considerably, with revenue growth of 2.8% in the second half of 2019 compared to a revenue decline of 2.4% in the first half of the year. the investments in new producers within our benefits and insurance group is a multiyear effort, and we continue to be strategic and intentional in order to attract, train and develop new producers to be successful. our results are encouraging, especially given that the performance of the new producers as a group is outpacing our expectations in regards to production. likewise, we spent much of the past year focused on improving our stewardship efforts to increase client retention rates, and those efforts appear to be paying off. looking ahead, in 2020, we're continuing to build capabilities and actively manage the investment in new producers.
there are a number of factors in place, but the first half versus second half growth rates i outlined for the benefits and insurance group is consistent with the results that we're seeing with this new producer investment. within our payroll business, 2019 was a transitional year as we introduced a new comprehensive human capital management platform. this platform allows us to serve larger, more sophisticated clients with more complex needs, while our legacy platform allows us to continue to meet the needs of our small and midsized clients. the launch of the new platform was delayed for a few months early in 2019, which put us behind schedule for the year. but since introducing this new product to the market, response from clients and prospects has been very positive and the size of revenue pipeline for this new product offering is very encouraging. to recap, we are very pleased with the full year earnings results recorded for 2019.
demand for our core financial services continues to be steady and strong, and we're seeing a stronger pipeline of our more project-oriented private equity business. we are very pleased to see the improved second half 2019 revenue growth rates within our benefits and insurance group, and we expect these positive trends to continue in 2020. coupled with an expectation for stronger same unit revenue, we expect acquisition activity in 2020 will contribute additional growth. we're off to a strong start with a robust pipeline of transactions under review.
so with that, i will turn it over to ware grove, our cfo, for a few comments, and then we'll be back to talk more about the year ahead. ware?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. as i think about the highlights for 2019, the full year 110 basis point margin improvement on income from continued operations before tax is a sign of real strength in our business. the timing of investments in our business in any one year has an impact on margin. but we will continue to say that a 20 to 50 basis points annual improvement in pre-tax margin is what we strive for as a goal over time. cash flow in the business continues to be strong. adjusted ebitda was $120.6 million for 2019 or 12.7% of revenue. that is a nearly 90 basis points improvement compared with the prior year. we can continue to leverage the growth in adjusted ebitda, and we expect further improvement in 2020. at december 31, 2019, the balance outstanding on our $400 million unsecured credit facility was $105.5 million. this represents a $30 million reduction over prior year leaving unused financing capacity of $287.7 million at year-end 2019.
during 2019, our cash flow statement will reflect that we used $29.2 million for acquisitions, net of client cash acquired. aside from the client cash acquired in connection with our acquisition of pay time, a small payroll operation that was acquired in july, we used $37.3 million for acquisition payments in 2019. as we look ahead on future acquisition earn-out obligations, as of year-end 2019, we expect cash payments of approximately $16.5 million in 2020, $8.9 million for 2021 and approximately $5.8 million for 2022. we actively conducted share repurchases throughout 2019. for the full year, we used approximately $27.2 million to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, including activity in the fourth quarter, during which we repurchased approximately 160,000 shares at a cost of approximately $4.3 million. we have continued to actively repurchase shares since the end of the year. utilizing a 10b5 program through february 14 this year, we have repurchased an additional 168,000 shares at a cost of approximately $4.6 million.
with nearly $288 million of unused financing capacity, we have plenty of room to address both strategic acquisition opportunities and continue to actively repurchase shares. earlier this month, as is our pattern in recent years, the authorization to repurchase up to five million shares was renewed for the upcoming year. as we look to 2020, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count for the full year of approximately 56 million shares. of course, as we progress through the year, we will update this as continuing share repurchase activity impacts the expected share count. days sales outstanding on receivables was 75 days at december 31, 2019, and that compares with 75 days at year-end, the prior year.
during 2019, we used approximately $13.9 million for capital items, $3.6 million in the fourth quarter. the majority of capital spending at cbiz is focused on facility improvements associated with lease renewals or moves, plus office, personal computer or other it-related equipment purchases. depreciation and amortization expense was $22.3 million for the full year 2019 compared to $23.7 million the prior year. so to recap, this all reflects the continued strong cash flow performance of the business, reducing debt by $30 million during 2019 while also using roughly $65 million for acquisitions and share repurchases. our effective tax rate at 23.5% for the full year of 2019 came in lower than expected, primarily due to the favorable impact of stock compensation accounting associated with the exercise of options, much of which occurred in the fourth quarter. the many variables associated with accounting for stock compensation and the impact on the effective tax rate are difficult to predict, and there was a significant favorable impact in the fourth quarter. as we look to 2020, we are expecting the effective full year tax rate to be approximately 24%.
as always, the effective tax rate could be either higher or lower and can be impacted by a number of the unpredictable variables, and so we will update this expectation quarterly as we progress through the year. many of you are aware that it is important to adjust reported results to eliminate the impact of accounting for gains or losses on the assets held in our deferred compensation plan, which were approximately $107 million at december 31. when you eliminate the accounting for gains or losses on these assets, the adjusted operating income margin for the full year of 2019 was 10.5% compared with 9.5% for the prior year. as is our practice, the earnings release includes information that will enable you to make these adjustments. and of course, this information will also be outlined in our upcoming 10-k filing. it is worth noting the accounting for gains or losses on the deferred compensation plan assets is also captured in other income or other expense, and you see a large year-over-year difference reported in 2019 compared with the prior year. eliminating the gains or losses for other income, the adjusted amount for 2019 would represent approximately $1.5 million of other expense compared with approximately $2.2 million of other expense the prior year.
as a reminder, there is no impact on the reported income from continuing operations before tax. reported margins for the full year 2019 is 9.8% compared with 8.7% reported for the full year of 2018. the revenue growth numbers reported for 2019 were impacted by softness within several service lines plus the impact of divestitures and the year-over-year comparison from several highly transactionally oriented businesses. the most important takeaway is that the core business is performing well. with the second half accelerated revenue growth rates reported for 2019, everything points to stronger full year growth in 2020 with continued opportunities for margin expansion. so to summarize, as we look ahead to 2020, we expect total revenue to grow within a range of 5% to 7% over the $948.4 million reported for 2019. this includes the several small acquisitions closed to date, which were announced effective at february one this year. we expect a full year 2020 effective tax rate at approximately 24%. as mentioned earlier, the effective tax rate can be either higher or lower depending upon a number of unpredictable factors. we expect the full year weighted average fully diluted share count for 2020 will be approximately 56 million shares. this could be impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of future share repurchase activity, and we will provide updates each quarter as we progress through 2020. we expect fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow within a range of 10% to 12% from the $1.27 per share reported for 2019.
so with these comments, i will conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ware. before we move on to q&a, i'd like to take a few moments just for a few additional comments. first, relative to our outlook for the year, as ware stated in his remarks, we're expecting total revenue growth within the range of 5% to 7% in 2020. while certain components of forecasted revenue are more difficult to predict than others, we're comfortable today guiding within that range based on the continued strong demand for our core services that we're experiencing and a return to more historic growth rate from certain of our project-oriented consulting businesses. now turning to acquisitions. we've already experienced a much stronger start in 2020 with more deals further along in our process than in recent years. already this year, we've completed the acquisition of pension dynamics, a full-service retirement and benefit plan advisor located in the san francisco bay area. this acquisition expands our retirement plan advisory capacity and complements our existing footprint on the west coast.
we also completed the acquisition of alliance insurance services, inc., a property and casualty insurance agency with a proven track record of serving small and mid-market businesses in the d.c. metro area, a market where we already have a strong presence and are in much need of the exceptional talent that we added through this acquisition. finally, i talked earlier about our transition to a more comprehensive payroll and human capital management platform to serve larger and more complex clients. our recent acquisition of sunshine systems provides implementation expertise and capacity that will ensure that we can be responsive to the strong pipeline of client interest that we are seeing in this new platform while continuing to provide exceptional client service. last, a note on our culture. perhaps the defining characteristic of cbiz, in which we all take an incredible amount of pride, is our culture. our culture is what ties our team together and our values are the foundation of that culture.
we are truly a people business, and the nearly 5,000 professionals who make up our team are among the most talented in our industries. one of the most important metrics we use to measure our progress is the feedback we receive from our workforce through surveys conducted by various external organizations. in 2019, cbiz was recognized with 62 workplace awards, including many best place to work awards. this is a new record for our company and demonstrates why we prioritize our work around culture. i'm grateful to our team members and their commitment to our clients and their commitment to each other.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to q&a.

[operator instructions]. the first question today comes from andrew nicholas with william blair. please go ahead.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. you talked about your m&a pipeline skewing a bit more toward large firms. and i'm wondering if that's a concentrated effort on your part to go after some bigger players? or if there's anything unique to the market driving that trend?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, andrew. this is jerry. it's really not unique to the market. we have, for a long time, really been increasing the amount of effort that we put into sourcing transactions. as a result of that, i think our volume has increased over the past several years. and by virtue of the volume increase, we just have a number of transactions that are larger than we have completed in recent years. these aren't transactions that are outside the band of what you may have seen historically in cbiz, but certainly larger than what we've been able to complete in recent years
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
got it. and then i think in the past, you talked about institutionalizing your efforts to improve pricing yields across a variety of your businesses. i'm just wondering if you could speak to the progress of that initiative. and how much you expect pricing to contribute to same-store growth in 2020?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
another good question. that is something that we really initiated about two years ago. that's a continuing effort. so i would say we're still in the pretty early innings there. what i would tell you is that it's kind of office-by-office. we've made investments here at the corporate office with a group of resources that are dedicated to working with each of those offices. we also have some support with some external resources. the offices that we've been able to work with have the efforts have been very well received. it's a combination of process and tools to help them give have better visibility into client pricing and client profitability, and by actually service line. and so again, early innings, but we believe that we've seen some impact from those efforts in 2019, we expect to see even greater impact in 2020. and we expect that, that impact will continue on into years even beyond that.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
great, thank you.

the next question comes from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. this is stefanos crist calling for chris. can you provide some more detail on the rollout of the human capital management program? is there a time that will be fully rolled out? and are there any other specific milestones for 2020?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so that system is now fully operational within our payroll business. what we found, stefanos, was that the platform that we our legacy platform that we've historically had is very well suited for smaller or mid-sized clients. but as our clients, some of them were larger, certainly larger prospects, with more sophisticated needs, more complex needs, the legacy product that we had wasn't always well suited for those needs and that level of clients. so we identified that platform probably 18 months ago. we had anticipated that we would have a contract signed with them early in 2019.
it took a few more months for us to get that contract signed. but once we have the contract signed, and we had our teams trained on the capabilities of that platform, what we've seen is a very strong reception from our clients, very strong reception from prospects and a very encouraging pipeline of opportunities coming out of that. what we expect going forward is that the momentum that we've seen throughout the second half of 2019 will continue to get even stronger. and so we're very encouraged by what we've seen and continue to be very bullish on the opportunities there.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. and beyond m&a, what are the biggest uncertainties for 2020? and maybe more specifically, what would drive a stronger-than-expected year? and also on the other side, what would drive a weaker-than-expected?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so let's start with our outlook for 2020, where i what we said in our comments is that if you look at the optimism that we're seeing in the market for our clients, which are smb principally smb clients, our clients continue to be very optimistic about the prospects for their business. they're quite optimistic about their local economies and their state economies. there is always going to be or at least in recent years, there's more uncertainty around the global economic picture. and then as we get into the year, the question will be the impact of the election on their optimism. so i think the real uncertainty is anything that may happen globally, coronavirus, tariffs, etc, and certainly how the market reacts to the unfolding election outcomes.
stefanos crist -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. thank you guys so much.

next question comes from jim macdonald with first analysis. please go ahead.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
good morning, guys. could you talk a little bit so in your guidance for revenue, are you assuming any more acquisitions in that? or is that just what you've done so far?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, jim, this is ware. just the acquisitions that we've announced effective february 1, those are included in the guidance for 2020. any future acquisitions are not included in the guidance. so as we close future acquisitions, we can update guidance, if it's warranted at that point in time.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and you seem to have continued good earnings leverage in your 2020 guidance, can you comment about where those what where that's coming from?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, jim. this is ware, again. same sources we always look to. we want to utilize people, and we talked about the pricing initiative and getting the yield per hour up that improves margin, improving our back office staffing and our fixed costs with rent facilities and those different office-related expenses. that's typically the source. now against that, we do time different investments. so it's a little bit choppy in terms of our ability to gain great leverage or some modest leverage. but we will say 20 to 50 basis points annually is a good target over time.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up question on the hcm module. could you talk a little bit more about what's included there? and what are some of the new applications in addition to payroll that might be in that those in that module?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jim. i know you're familiar with this space. that hcm module is really a complete and comprehensive hris system, along with payroll and also allows us to integrate employee benefits and retirement plan services. so some 401(k) into that platform. so it is a true, kind of, a to z hris system that works very well with our ability to integrate other product offerings for our clients.
jim macdonald -- first analysis -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks a lot, guys.

[operator instructions]. the next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, good morning.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
hi, marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i wanted to if you could share a little bit of what the cadence of last year, the timing of the irs guidelines and complexities, i was wondering if you could sort of give some thoughts and views as to what you're seeing this year, and how much of it has sort of hopefully returned to normalcy. but i was wondering if you could give a little bit of a background as far as what you're seeing as far as level of complexity, and what we should expect as far as cadence of tax filings this year.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, marc, thank you. you're right. i think when you describe it as a return to normalcy, that's what we're hoping for, and that's kind of what we're expecting to do 2020. there is nothing of the magnitude of tax reform on the horizon that we see right now. as we we're hoping that one year into tax reform, we will become much more efficient and familiar with the requirements there, and that will help us, obviously, from a profitability standpoint throughout 2020. but we don't see anything that is, again, on the horizon that would be outside the norm, at least at this time.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. and then maybe if you could just give a brief update on investment priorities other than the certainly, you've been busy with acquisitions, so i was wondering if you could sort of talk about headcount, personnel, maybe some priorities and target areas that you're looking at to focus on for 2020.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so to start with, obviously, we're a human capital business, right? so we're always going to be focused on talent. as we've commented many times on these calls, increasing continuing to make investments and increase the number of producers that we have on the benefits and insurance side of the business and then making sure that they have the right tools to provide high-quality, high-value, differentiated products and services to our clients. so things like the hcm system, obviously, are going to be ongoing investments. same thing, i guess, on the financial services side, there's always opportunity for us to bring on lateral talent that oftentimes is costly certainly in the year that they join us. but we've budgeted for those things. we've been able to find top talents around the country and been able to absorb those within our p&l.
we mentioned the investments in what we call our pmo office, which is really the practice management office that helps our each of our offices, understand better understand client profitability and pricing. as i mentioned, we're using some outside resources there. that's been very well received. and then, of course, we started several years ago with our national branding campaign, and we would expect those efforts to continue at about the same levels into 2020. so we just came out of, as you would expect, right, last the end of last year, budgeting. we work very closely with the offices and the service lines and of course, the heads of the practice groups to understand their investment needs. we are very pleased to say that we feel like we've been able to meet those needs in the numbers that we're guiding to for 2020 and continue to produce the results that you're seeing and the results that we're guiding to.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst

jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lori. good morning everyone. given all that's happened with the covid-19 pandemic since our last earnings release, i would like to begin today's call with a reminder of the key attributes of our business, which should provide helpful context around how we performed in the first quarter, how we continue to navigate in the current environment and what we expect to see for our business in the months to come.
cbiz is a leading provider of accounting, insurance and other professional business services to a wide range of clients, including small and middle market businesses. we are not highly concentrated in any particular geography or industry, which helps to insulate us when economic conditions or other events occur that have a disproportionate impact on certain regions or industries.
approximately 65% of our total revenues were generated by our financial services group. among the businesses within that group are our tax and accounting business, our private equity advisory business and our government healthcare consulting business. in a typical year, we see strong contribution from this group in the first quarter since our accounting and tax work related to normal filing of payment deadlines is compressed. in addition to the revenue generated by our more recurring services, approximately 27% of the revenue generated within this group comes from more project oriented services that are less recurring, such as tax consulting and certain other advisory services. our government healthcare consulting business typically enters into longer-term contracts so we view that business as more recurring.
turning to our benefits and insurance group, we generated approximately 31% of our total revenue from this group. among the businesses within this group are our employee benefits business, our payroll business, our property and casualty business and our retirement plan services business. the majority of revenue generated within this group is typically spread more evenly throughout the year. a smaller portion of revenue is project oriented through our more transactional businesses like our executive search business. by their nature, these project oriented businesses can be harder to predict in terms of timing and certainty throughout the year.
many of the services that we provide within both the financial services group and the benefits and insurance group are considered essential services that our clients need regardless of economic conditions. for example, essential services include the completion of tax returns, payroll processing, property and casualty insurance, employee health insurance and a host of others. revenue from these essential services typically represent approximately 70% of our total revenues in most years, which creates a more reliable and predictable revenue stream.
as a professional services company, approximately 60% of our expenses are in the form of wages. within each practice group, a significant portion of the wages for our highest wage earners are variable. this structure is designed to reward our team members for high individual performance and for growth in more favorable years and to mitigate the impact on earnings in less favorable economic times. one of our key market differentiators is that we provide a much broader range of products, services and solutions than many of our competitors who are most often monoline. our breadth of services is particularly valuable to our clients when the issues or opportunities they are facing are complex and touch multiple aspects of their business.
the stimulus packages enacted to help business in response to the pandemic is a perfect example of this kind of situation where businesses need broad-based solutions that address multiple areas of their organizations. given our unique ability to coordinate multiple services, we've been hard at work helping our clients and prospects understand how to avail themselves of the opportunities presented by these various programs.
with that, by way of background, we kicked off 2020 with a great deal of momentum coming off of a very strong 2019. we were pleased with the performance of the business through mid-march. we're also pleased with the results that we experienced in a number of the businesses where we've made substantial investments over the years, including the investments that we've made in producers in our employee benefits business and investments in our new service platform for our larger more complex payroll clients.
for the first quarter of 2020, we reported total revenue growth of 2.8%, same unit revenue growth of 0.9% and earnings per diluted share of $0.66 versus $0.67 reported for the same period a year ago. we believe that those results would have been even stronger but we began to see the impact of covid-19 and the resulting government stay-at-home orders in the second half of march. our results in the second half of march were impacted by a number of factors including inefficiencies experienced as many of our team members migrated from office space work environment to working from home. in addition, normally our tax and accounting team is working at full capacity throughout march to meet government deadlines for compliance work. in late march and early april, the irs extended both tax filing and payment deadlines. once those deadlines were extended, our clients slowed the delivery to us of the information that we need from them to complete our work. the result is that we filed significantly fewer tax returns in the first quarter than expected. this is work that we will still complete but it will be shifted into the second and third quarters rather than being completed in the first quarter as expected.
it's important to note that our advisory services business was off to a strong start in the first quarter. however, because the nature of the work is often tied to a transaction or more discretionary investment by our clients, the demand for these services started to decrease in mid-march. we expect to see a more significant impact on this business line for the remainder of the year as our clients put planned investments on hold to preserve cash and potentially reassess. limitations on travel may also have an impact on our advisory engagements as this work often requires onsite component with our clients. at the same time, our clients are adapting to these limitations just like we are, and we've made steady progress on using virtual solutions in place of onsite work.
our government healthcare consulting business was also off to a strong start to the year with several projects that were delayed in 2019 getting back on track in early 2020. fortunately, we've not experienced any material contracts of this business being put on hold, but we do expect some delays in the timing of revenue. those delays will impact the pacing of revenue in 2020 and may shift some work from this year into next.
now turning to our benefits and insurance business, which experienced a good first quarter with strong sales and improved client retention, those results were impacted by lower revenue in our retirement plan services business tied to the financial markets and the cancellation of policies in our property and casualty insurance business. these cancellations were specifically related to the hospitality and recreation industries. given the record unemployment numbers, we also expect that we will begin to see some negative impact on our payroll business as companies reduce the number of workers on their payroll, either temporarily or permanently. we were pleased to have closed three acquisitions within our benefits and insurance group during the first quarter. these three transactions includes pension dynamics, a retirement plan services advisory firm located in the san francisco bay area, alliance insurance services, a washington dc-based property and casualty agency, and sunshine systems, a payroll implementation provider located in newburyport, massachusetts.
now i would like to turn to our response to covid-19, which began in late february. with our core values as our guide, our top priority was and continues to be the safety and well-being of our team members and our clients. at the outset, we took proactive steps to safeguard our team members and our clients, including limiting access to our offices, suspending business travel and shifting our teams to working remotely to minimize disruption to clients and to maintain continuity in our operations. i am particularly proud of how our team quickly leveraged technology and new tools to make this a smoother process for both ourselves and our clients. we are also proud of the fact that with over 100 offices nationwide, we remained open and operational throughout the outset of the pandemic.
we are fortunate to have come into the situation in a very strong financial position having come off a solid performance in 2019 and with a strong balance sheet, low levels of debt, ready access to capital and a supportive lending group. that strength has allowed us to be measured but proactive in our response, while at the same time ramping up our efforts to support our clients in navigating this challenging and evolving business climate. we continue to be proactive in taking steps to protect our business as the situation unfolds. in late march, we drew down on our credit facility. while we had and continue to have sufficient cash flow and access to capital to support the ongoing needs of the business, we elected to draw down the facility, out of an abundance of precaution to ensure that the funds would be available to support the ongoing needs of the business if and when needed.
in addition, we also took a number of cost-containment measures including the following: hiring freeze for all but business critical positions, we limited all but the most mission critical discretionary spending, we paused strategic initiatives and our national marketing campaign, we deferred some compensation actions and we took advantage of the cares act provision that enables us to defer our employer payroll taxes. these measures have put us on firm financial footing to date, but given the uncertainty around how long our current environment is likely to last, the pace of recovery and the impact on our clients, we continue to closely monitor our key operating metrics and have identified additional measures, if warranted, based on future changes to our revenue outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2021.
despite some of the challenges caused by the current environment, we continue to see a substantial number of opportunities based on our unique ability to help our clients and prospects navigate these uncharted waters. since the onset of the pandemic, we've remained focused on how we can support our clients through the most challenging business climate many of us have ever experienced. as i mentioned, a portion of our clients are small and middle market businesses and many were hit hard by the impact of the stay-at-home and related efforts to flatten the curve. we immediately began to shift resources and engage our subject matter experts to help our clients respond, plan and take advantage of the opportunities as the federal relief packages began to be released.
a great example of this work is the covid-19 resource center we established on our website that brings together thought leadership, new content and tools from across cbiz to assist our clients on a wide variety of challenges, concerns and questions. we have developed 18 webinars based on our new content to date all of which are available on demand through our resource center. these webinars bring our clients and prospects the most up-to-date information and guidance available and typically attract more than 1,000 attendees. following each webinar, we have a team of people who reach out to participants to follow up on any questions or needs they may have. as a result of this and other outreach efforts, we are working with our clients and prospects on a significant number of new engagements and proposals.
we recognize that this is a time when our clients need us the most and our continued outreach and support has been well received. while the characteristics of the business provide us with comfort that much of the revenue that we received from the essential services that we provide will be realized this year, there remains a great deal of uncertainty around the duration and severity of the pandemic on the economy as a whole and on the demand for some of the services that we provide. given that uncertainty, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance, which was provided on february 20, 2020. so with that, i will turn it over to ware grove, our chief financial officer for a few comments on our financials, and then we'll be back to talk more about our plans for returning to a new normal and our approach to mergers and acquisitions in our current environment. ware?
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jerry, and good morning everyone. as i normally do, i want to take a few minutes to run through the highlights of the numbers we released this morning. more importantly, i want to shed some light on the uncertainty in the business environment and the actions we are taking.
total revenue for the first quarter was $277.5 million, an increase of 2.8% over first quarter a year ago with same unit revenue up 0.9%. impacted by some of the events related to the covid-19 health crisis in the first quarter, the margin on income from continued operations before tax was 18.1% compared with 19% for the first quarter a year ago. with an effective tax rate of 26.7%, net income was $36.8 million this year or $0.66 per share compared with $0.67 a share in the first quarter a year ago.
adjusted ebitda was $57 million or 20.6% of revenue in the first quarter. total revenue within our financial services group increased by 2% with same unit revenue up by 1.2% in the first quarter. with a migration to working from home that occurred in mid-march, there were inefficiencies during what is normally a very highly productive and busy tax time for tax-compliance work. our workforce is equipped for and is accustomed to working remotely. however, at the same time, many of our clients, who were also adjusting to working remotely focused on their own immediate issues in response to the onset of the pandemic and the overall sharing of information that commonly occurs during this time, did experience some delays. as a result, our productivity suffered and this impacted first quarter revenue.
turning to the benefits and insurance business, total revenue grew by 4.4% in the first quarter with same unit revenue declining by 0.6%. we are very pleased to see the continuing improvements and the new business generated as a result of our investment in new producers, and we have seen stronger client retention as well. there was a decline in revenue in our retirement advisory business related to the general decline in market asset valuations at the end of the first quarter. also, the level of non-recurring actuarial project work in the first quarter of this year did not match the level of a year ago. with the loss of productivity in the second half of march, combined with the other items we have commented on, we estimate the first quarter revenue was impacted within a range of approximately $4 million to $5 million, the majority of which is related to tax-compliance work that will get recaptured later this year.
in addition, while the cares act and the economic relief measures enacted are helpful, the extended stay-at-home orders and the associated economic disruption have created financial distress throughout the economy. as jerry commented, we have a large and diverse set of clients with no particular concentration but you should be aware that we increased our bad debt reserve by $2 million in the first quarter to recognize the increased payment risk and receivables. bad debt expense for the first quarter of this year was 82 basis points of total revenue compared with 39 basis points in the first quarter a year ago.
we made three acquisitions in the first quarter that will have an annualized revenue contribution of approximately $6.1 million. acquisition-related spending in the first quarter was approximately $12.4 million. for the balance of 2020, earn-out payments for acquisitions previously closed are estimated at approximately $10.6 million, and for 2021 approximately $11 million, for 2022 approximately $7.7 million, and for 2023, $700,000 and for 2024, approximately $200,000.
during the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $29.5 million. as covid-19 related issues became disruptive to the business environment, in mid-march, we suspended further share repurchases. with the share repurchase activity to date, we expect our full year fully diluted share count at approximately 55.5 million shares.
now let me turn to how we are dealing with the current environment. in normal conditions, cbiz generates strong cash flow from operations. as we enter the second quarter, we are managing our liquidity very carefully. we want to navigate through this period and emerge with financial capacity and the wherewithal to take advantage of acquisition and other investment opportunities that lie ahead. to preserve cash, we are taking advantage of the cares act provision that enables companies to defer the payment of employer payroll taxes. in addition, we are watching customer collections on receivables very carefully as clients take actions to preserve their own liquidity. days sales outstanding on receivables was 94 days at the end of the first quarter this year compared with 97 days a year ago. i want to remind you that day sales outstanding typically increase in the first half of the year as we build receivables and they normally liquidate into cash later in the year.
our strong balance sheet has given us great flexibility to deploy capital for strategic investments. in late march, as we observed the dysfunction in the capital markets that was occurring at that time, we made a decision to draw down $210 million on our credit facility. our liquidity is strong and this decision was made strictly as a precautionary measure to preserve our financial flexibility in the event further disruptions were encountered. at the end of march, our cash position was $216.9 million. net of the cash position, our debt outstanding was $166.1 million, which results in a net debt leverage as measured against our trailing-12 month ebitda of 1.4 times. as jerry outlined, we have taken a number of actions to manage expenditures and cash flows. in fact, with the actions taken to date, our cash position has improved by approximately $18 million from $216.9 million at the end of march to $234.5 million at the end of april. this is during a time when our normal seasonal pattern is to use cash. this is very positive confirmation that our initial efforts are on track. but it remains very unclear what the ultimate impact may be. like many others, we are actively modeling different scenarios and we have prepared contingency plans.
as a result of the high degree of uncertainty, as jerry mentioned, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. when business conditions are ready, we want to be well-positioned to deploy capital for strategic investments and acquisitions, including the potential for further share repurchases. depending upon how the economy rebounds, longer term, we are navigating through this period of uncertainty in order to emerge in strong condition and be ready to achieve the same revenue growth, operating leverage and cash flow attributes that we have recorded over many years for cbiz. so with these comments, i will conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ware. as you would expect, we have a comprehensive plan in place to bring our team members back into our offices and client sites in a measured and responsible manner. with offices across the country, we are closely tracking the state and local plans in each region and what is required to safely reopen our offices for team members, clients and visitors. as stay-at-home and related efforts begin to expire or ease, we will be bringing our team back in three phases. in order to do this, we have numerous safety measures in place including plans to maintain social distancing within our workplace, continued use of virtual meeting tools and enhanced protocols to protect our team members' health. as part of this process, we also plan to resume client-related travel and work at client sites in the near future.
while i'm confident that the actions we are taking now will ensure that we have a safe and healthy workplace, we have also learned a great deal over the past two months. our team did a remarkable job in shifting to remote work arrangements and embracing new technology. this experience has illustrated what is possible with more people working remotely and how we can best support them in the future. overall, we will be taking these lessons learned to help accelerate our thinking on everything from future real estate needs to recruiting for talent. i believe that what we've learned through the crisis will continue to shape our strategy through the recovery and beyond.
finally, with regard to m&a, in addition to the three transactions that we closed in the first quarter, our m&a efforts were active right up until the onset of the pandemic. we began 2020 with a robust pipeline of potential acquisitions, including a number of larger deals and we're making steady progress when the effects of the pandemic hit in mid-march. at that point, like most other firms, we made the decision to put a hold on closing any further transactions in the short term. we made that decision not only to conserve cash but equally because we always strive to provide the teams that join us with the best possible on-boarding experience and we believe that, that would be nearly impossible to create in the current environment. waiting to close pending transactions will allow us to be much more thoughtful about the integration experience for the sellers and it dissolves the time, resources and attention necessary to ensure a successful transition. we are also continuing to actively engage in conversations with prospective acquisition candidates and believe that new opportunities will emerge in the coming months as professional services firms better appreciate the advantages of being part of a large well-capitalized and diverse organization like cbiz, that is better able to weather the storm and provide resources and solutions to clients that smaller organizations may not have the breadth or depth to provide. with that, i will now turn it back over for q&a.

thank you. we will now begin the q&a session. [operator instructions] the first question will come from andrew nicholas with william blair. please go ahead.
andrew nicholas -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. hope each of you is safe and healthy. just recognizing the current environment is unique in a variety of ways, but still wanting to use the last recession as a reference point, can you maybe talk through how the business mix today compares to '08, '09 and maybe how you think those differences or the major differences are likely to reflect themselves in your financial performance this time around?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
so, andrew, it's jerry. good morning, thanks for the question. we've looked a lot at that environment and the positives are that if you look back at our performance during that period of time, we actually performed quite well, certainly relative to many other businesses in the environment and i think it's the key attributes of the business that allowed us to do that. first, the fact that we provide, in large part, essential services to our clients and our clients need those services, kind of regardless of the business climate. second, it's times of challenge and complexity that our clients most turn to us and we saw that then and we see that now as we've developed our covid resource center and really worked hand-in-glove and side-by-side with our clients to help them navigate in this very complex environment. so that not only creates opportunities for us to generate revenue as a result of those consulting engagements, but it also helps with retention and it certainly helps to build a goodwill.
so we came out of that environment, again, relatively strong compared to others. we're confident that the attributes that we -- that led to that are equally applicable today. on top of that, since that time, 12 years, we've made substantial investments in our processes, in our systems, in our infrastructure, and i believe that we're a much stronger organization today than we were even back then. and so all of those things should help us to emerge from this environment strong as well.
andrew nicholas -- william blair & company -- analyst
great, thank you. and do you expect any competitive dislocation to come out of the current environment, and if so, where would you expect that to be concentrated within your various businesses? and then any color on how you expect cbiz to capitalize would be helpful.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's interesting. here is what we're hearing -- and its early. right? it's early and time will tell. right? but we're hearing that certainly many of the smaller competitors that we face off against are significantly capital constrained in this environment. they did not have strong balance sheets. they did not have access to capital. they had embedded retirement obligations that were unfunded. there is a number of factors that i think are placing significant strain on many of the competitors, and i'm referring specifically in the accounting industry right now and we've seen that. many of them have had substantial reductions in staffing, they've -- some of them have really kind of closed their doors through this period of time to try to conserve cash. all of that should allow us to increase market share. we were proud of the fact that not only didn't we close our doors, but we very proactively engaged with our clients throughout this period of time, we've engaged with a substantial number of prospects throughout this period of time and we would expect that as a result of our approach, our resources, our size, our scale, that we should gain market share in this environment.
andrew nicholas -- william blair & company -- analyst
great, thank you. and then if you wouldn't mind, i'll squeeze one more in, before getting back in the queue. just on the expense base, i think you mentioned 60% of that expense base is in the form of wages. could you provide a little bit more color on what within that compensation line is variable and the extent to which you expect to be able to flex that up and down depending on kind of the top-line environment? thank you.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't have the exact percentage, andrew, but let me just tell you a little bit by category, what we're talking about, and i mentioned that a high percentage of the -- of our highest wage earners have a significant variable component. so on the benefits and insurance side, many of our high wage earners are commission driven. they get paid a higher commission based on new revenue that comes in the door and then they get paid a lower level of commission on retained business. but that commission structure is variable and in years where there is high levels of production, obviously, they earn more as they should. in years where it's a little bit more challenged, our compensation in those areas is less.
turning to our financial services group, we have approximately 300 of our top wage earners, our managing directors fall in that category. there is approximately 30% of the compensation for that group that's somewhat variable, part of it is tied to the performance of the individual office and that office making plan and then part of it is tied to their individual goals. but again, much of that is variable based on revenue production, hours billed, client realization, all the key metrics within that group. so again while i don't have an exact percentage as to what that calculates to it, as i said, substantial percentage for both categories of high wage earners within our organization.
andrew nicholas -- william blair & company -- analyst
great, thanks a lot.
operator
the next question comes from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
brendan popson -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, guys. this is brendan on for chris. i wanted to ask what's -- and i know it's going to be tough to answer with any kind of precision. but with what you can see now, what is your view on 2020 revenue? and then and even more importantly, is that a -- when we're thinking about 2021, do you view that 2020 as a new base for looking at growth levels beyond 2020 or do you think that there is reason to believe there could be some kind of catch-up for some of the revenue that shows up in '21 or what's your base as we sit today? what's your view on that?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let me just say that we withdrew guidance, we're not yet in a position to be able to give guidance for the remainder of 2020 as a result of all the factors that everybody else is struggling with as well, that being the duration of the existing environment, the impact of the environment on cbiz and our clients and when eventually we do start to come out of this, the pace of that recovery. so for all of those reasons, we don't yet have enough visibility into 2020 in order to be able to give guidance on the number. with that said, here is the comforting facts, right, like i said on the call, to the extent that we had some of the revenue that we otherwise would have expected to occur in the first quarter, certainly, as it relates to the extension of tax or the preparation of tax returns, we expect that, that revenue will be realized in 2020.
there are other components of our revenue stream and i'm thinking, particularly our government healthcare consulting business where -- while that -- those are long term contracts that work needs to be done, we believe that, that business will remain strong throughout the year. what happened was the federal government gave relief to the states and then providing some of the critical information that we need in order to do our work, that work, again, will get done. but the question is, does some of that push into 2021? time will tell. but again, we're confident that the work is not gone away, the work will get done, and we believe a good deal of it will get done in 2020. we just don't have visibility into the full scope of that work and when it will be realized.
brendan popson -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay and then kind of a similar line of thought, but looking at your margins, your target pre-tax margin improvement 20 basis points to 50 basis points a year, obviously fy '20 is going to be tough for that and fall shy -- probably fall shy at that level. but again, is there a reason to think that that's, whatever level you fall to, that's the base and you'll look to improve 20 basis points to 50 basis points beyond that, or will there -- is there also potential for some kind of margin catch-up in -- beyond 2020?
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, brendan. this is ware grove. yeah, that's another difficult one to answer. jerry said it well, some of this revenue will get caught up and will be spread later in this year, some of it may get pushed into next year. one thing to keep in mind, as you look at the margin in the first quarter, we commented that we increased our bad debt allowance by $2 million. that's about an 80 basis points impact on first quarter margins. we thought that was a prudent move in light of the economic stress throughout the economy at this point in time, and don't know how it's all going to turn out yet, but that did have a big impact on first quarter margins. that will not hopefully be a recurring item. so that's a recoverable item once that charge is done and enough and behind us.
the other things are really difficult to answer. it depends on revenue growth, our cost structure. we do have levers we're pulling to mitigate the impact on margin. but we can't completely mitigate all impact. and as we restore it, it just depends on how quickly the costs and the revenue can come back. it would be our intent over a longer period of time, and i'm not talking specifically in '21 versus '20, to continue to feel the business has the capability, with operating leverage built into it, to improve margins by 20 basis points to 50 basis points a year over time, the same attributes we feel that we've demonstrated and have a good track record of in the past. we feel those same attributes are still there in the business once we get through this.
brendan popson -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay, great, thank you for that color.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, marc.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, marc.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hopefully, everybody is safe and well and certainly wish you all the best. i wanted to touch a little bit on some of the commentary in the press release. just wondering if you could spend some time discussing some of the comments around increased demand, particularly around some of the government initiatives, kind of, maybe if you can sort of talk about kind of how that has materialized and if there has been a precedent that you've seen before that would drive something like that. and then i guess, included in that somewhat is, is that -- could you talk a little bit about where that demand is coming from, from existing customers, new customers, maybe what that mix might look like?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, marc. again, i think i've said it before, i said it on the script here, in a situation environment where there is complexity and challenges in the environment, our clients turn to us for help and helping them to navigate through this, we've seen that in this situation. someone referenced 2008, and 2009, you saw it back then as well. we saw it -- when you asked have we seen it before, we saw it with some of the healthcare issues a ways back. we've seen it with tax reform. so any time that there is changes or complexity in the environment, our clients and the market in general is far more receptive to the types of things that we have, the tools that we have and the services we have and the ways that we can help them. i think what's unique about this one and what really shines a light on our really unique market differentiator is the types of solutions that are available to our clients to help them navigate in this environment are not monoline. and so if you look at the types of relief efforts that have been put in place through the stimulus packages, i think when we went through it, there were 12 different disciplines that were touched upon, anywhere from applying for the loans that were available, to understanding the tax impact, to payroll implications, to insurance applications.
i will share with you that there is no organization that has the breadth of services and the geographic reach and the scope that cbiz has in order to help our clients and others in the market. so as a result of that -- and when you say how many clients have we helped, we've helped thousands of clients with the ppp loans and similar financial packages. we've had, i think, over 12,000 or 13,000 participants so far in our webinar series. we've reached out to those participants one-on-one to follow up on their participation, asked if they have had questions, we've had considerable number of opportunities that have come out of those situations. we are starting, just now, to see some pretty significant revenue opportunities coming from that outreach. so while it's not in the numbers obviously that you saw, we're highly encouraged by the feedback that we're getting from the resources that we've made available and encouraged by the revenue opportunities that we're seeing coming out of it. and again while apples-to-apples, there is no direct comparison that i can think of in the past, i can also not think of anything that is more better suited for the types of services we have, the breadth and the attributes that we have in order to bring value to our clients in this environment.
one other question, you said how many were clients, how many were prospects. i think it was typically around two-thirds to one-third. participants on the webinars were about two-thirds being clients, about one-third of them being other prospects and people from the outside. so considerable number of opportunities for us to expand market share.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, that's great, thank you for the detail, not just in this question but provided previously as well. i did want to touch also on just sort of the tax filing cadence because since the last year in itself was not a normal year due to the delayed irs guidelines. and i think at some point during the year, you had mentioned if i -- tell me if i'm misremembering this but i guess the filing extensions were up 10% year-over-year last year or something along those lines. and i was wondering if you had like a similar view or number or kind of maybe what you're seeing compared to last year.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, marc. that's a great question. so let me give you a little bit of color around that. in the busy season, the typical january 1 through april 15, we typically file x number of tax returns, about one-third of those get filed -- their pass-through-type entities get filed by march 15, we -- obviously, this had not really hit us at that point and so all of those returns were filed. about two-thirds of the returns that would typically get filed during between january 1 and april 15, about two-thirds of them really get filed on or around march 15 -- i'm sorry, april 15. of those, very few of them were filed this year. so last year we had a number of extensions, as you alluded, that kind of came out of tax reform and complexities around that, but we still received -- we still were able to get a great deal, great number of those returns filed by april 15. this year, very few of them were filed and it makes sense, because what happened was not only were the deadlines extended, but the payment deadlines were extended as well. so if had just been that the returns were extended, nonetheless, what has to happen is the work is done on the returns and then people pay estimated taxes.
when they deferred not only the requirement that you file the return, but also the payment, basically, our clients put their pens down and they said, we'll get to you, but this is not our highest priority right now. they're working through liquidity and other issues, trying to take advantage of some of the stimulus program. so that work will get done this year, but it will be pushed out into the second and third quarter. so we saw a substantial amount of them pushed off that will be realized in the second and third quarters.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. that's very, very helpful. thank you very much.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over for closing comments.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
okay, chad. thank you very much. with all the uncertainty around the duration and impact of covid-19 and the pace of recovery, i want to remind you that cbiz came into this situation in a very strong financial position and we have a number of key attributes that should allow us to continue to remain strong in the current business climate. these include the fact that many of our services are essential to our clients, are highly valued and represent a very low cost to them on a relative basis. we have a high percentage of our revenue that's recurring. we have a high retention rate among our clients. we have a variable cost structure with built-in leverage. we're not capital intensive. we generate significant amounts of free cash flow and we have low net debt outstanding.
in addition, our clients turn to us in times of uncertainty and complexity and there are few professional service organizations as well-positioned as cbiz to provide the solutions to the challenges that many businesses now face. we believe that our size, our geographic reach and our breadth of services will allow us the opportunity to gain market share in this environment and to resume and accelerate growth when the business climate resumes.
i'd like to thank our analysts and investors for joining us on today's call and for your continued support. and finally, i'd like to close by thanking our team members who may be listening to today's call for your inspirational can-do attitude throughout this environment, for your dedication to our clients and for your support that you've shown to each other and to our communities. thank you and stay healthy.

jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. before i discuss our results for the quarter and year-to-date, i thought it would be helpful to review certain of the key attributes of our business that we discussed at the end of the first quarter. including that, approximately 70% of our revenue is generated from essential services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that we provide to our clients regardless of economic conditions in the market. we generally retain approximately 90% of our clients from year-to-year. we have a broad geographic footprint. we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. we enjoy strong and consistent cash flow.
we have a substantial amount of variable expenses in our business, including a considerable amount of variable compensation based on the performance of the business. we have a strong balance sheet with ready access to capital, and we entered into the current environment with very low amount debt and in a very strong financial position. and it's those attributes that make us confident that our business will continue to perform well in our current environment. and in fact, that's precisely what we experienced in the second quarter and year-to-date. for the second quarter of 2020, revenue increased by $1.4 million over the same period in 2019.
earnings per share increased by 30% from $0.30 per diluted share for the second quarter last year compared with $0.39 per diluted share for the same period this year. and our adjusted ebitda for the second quarter was $35.9 million compared with $28.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 24.7%. as we expected, our business performed best in those areas where we provide the essential services that our clients need regardless of the business climate. within our financial services segment, our core accounting service delivered strong performance throughout the second quarter, bolstered by the irs extension of tax filing deadline from april 15 to july 15.
we also received strong contributions from our risk and advisory practice and our litigation support practices within this group. within our benefits and insurance group, we were pleased to see strong contributions from our employee benefits business, our 401(k) advisory practice and the personal and commercial lines portions of our property and casualty business. in addition, we're encouraged by favorable market reaction to our new payroll platform that targets mid-size and larger clients with more sophisticated needs.
and as we described in the past, our business always benefits in times of complexity and change, and the economic hardship faced by many of our clients following the onset of covid-19, allowed us to showcase our breadth of services and depth of expertise. our teams quickly mobilized to help our clients and prospects understand and access the wide range of stimulus and other relief packages available in this challenging business climate, including the payroll protection plan and the main street lending program. while our approach resonated with our current clients, it also allowed us to attract and serve new prospects that need of more sophisticated support to take advantage of the emerging relief programs.
these efforts combined with our ongoing digital outreach and thought leadership has led to a more robust pipeline of prospects for new business. in addition, the support that we continue to provide to our clients, in many cases, is vital to their financial health and will deepen our ongoing relationships in ways that will improve client retention, and support ongoing growth. also, as we expected, we did experience some softness in certain business lines that provide more discretionary project-oriented services, those that require us to be at the client's site to perform our work and a small amount of business tied to those industries hardest hit by the pandemic, including hospitality and restaurant business.
with that said, it's worth noting that the amount of our revenue tied to clients in those specific industries represents less than 5% of our total revenues. we also experienced some softness in our payroll business, which was impacted by layoffs and risks among a number of small and midsized business clients, although we have seen an improvement in that area over the past several weeks. finally, our government healthcare consulting business continues to perform well, but did not provide the growth that we normally experience as a result of a slowdown in the delivery of the information from our clients that we need to do our work, and our ability to be on-site to perform certain work. with that said, we are working with our clients to adopt virtual solutions that will lessen the need to be on site.
and moreover, the work that we do in this area still needs to be performed. so we would expect the work that was delayed in the second quarter will shift to the second half of the year and possibly flow into 2021. we've been asked at a number of occasions to compare the current economic climate to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. although there are substantial differences in the two scenarios, it was the attributes of our business that i described earlier that allowed us to perform well during the financial crisis, and it's those same attributes that are allowing us to continue to perform well in our current environment. in addition, since that time, we've made substantial investments in our people, processes and technology.
these investments have been meaningful in numerous aspects of our business, including the expansion of our producer team, implementation of a more sophisticated payroll platform, and improvements in our processes and systems with the goal of enabling more granular visibility into the profitability and pricing in our financial services businesses. these investments make us significantly stronger and more resilient today than we were in 2008. as mentioned earlier, we came into covid-19 pandemic in a very solid financial position, coming off a strong performance in 2019. in addition, at the outset of the pandemic, we took a number of cost control measures to preserve cash and mature liquidity, including implementing our hiring freeze, placing limits on all discretionary spending and suspending our stock buyback program.
the strength of our balance sheet and our cost control measures have allowed us to avoid the more severe actions taken by many of our competitors, including across-the-board compensation reductions, significant reductions in workforce and extensive furloughs. we believe that our team members are among the best in the industries. and throughout this time, maintaining our workforce has been a key priority. we note from watching the experience of other professional services firm, following the 2008 downturn, that those that significantly reduced our workforce found themselves in a challenging position when conditions started to improve.
while that was not our experience in 2008, our own lessons and those from others continue to inform our approach to the pandemic. all that being said, we recognize that the pandemic may be with us for the foreseeable future. while we are pleased with our performance in weathering the storm to date, and we are presently more focused on growth opportunities in survival, we have identified a number of additional cost control levers that are available to us if we should need to use them in the future.
at this point, i'll turn it over to ware grove, our chief financial officer, to provide more specific details on our financial performance for the second quarter and year-to-date.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
well, thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. i want to take a few minutes to run through the highlights of the numbers released this morning. further, i also want to talk in more detail about some of the actions we continue to take as we respond to the changing business environment and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. total revenue for the second quarter was $236.9 million, an increase of 0.6% over second quarter a year ago, with same unit revenue declining by 1.4%.
with the margin on income from continued operations before tax improving to 11.9% compared with 9.3% for the second quarter a year ago, earnings per share were $0.39 compared with $0.30 a share a year ago in the second quarter. adjusted ebitda was $35.9 million, or 15.1% of revenue in the second quarter this year, a 24% increase over $28.8 million a year ago. for the six months ended june this year, total revenue grew by 1.8%. as a result of improved margin on income from continuing operations before tax at 15.2% compared with 14.5% a year ago, earnings per share were $1.05 compared with $0.97 for the six months a year ago.
adjusted ebitda was $92.9 million or 18.1% of revenue, and this is up 7.4% over a year ago. total revenue within our financial services business was down 0.2%, with same unit revenue down 1% in the second quarter this year. for the first six months, financial services revenue grew by 1%, with same unit revenue up by 0.2%. turning to the benefits and insurance services. total revenue grew by 2.5% in the second quarter, with same unit revenue decreasing by 2.2%. for the first six months, benefits and insurance revenue was up 3.5%, with same unit revenue declining by 1.4%. as jerry commented, our core business attributes with essential and recurring services was relatively stable in the second quarter.
some service lines, such as valuation, private equity advisory, property and casualty program business and payroll are more vulnerable to the unstable economic environment, and we are taking targeted actions to more aggressively manage costs within those businesses. these four business units or service lines represent approximately 9% of second quarter revenue and approximately 11% of revenue for the six months. excluding the impact of these units, that were more severely impacted, the remaining core business growth was 4.1% for the quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, with the underlying same unit organic growth at 1.9% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date.
second quarter and six month results benefited from the reduction in operating costs, largely focused on reductions in travel, variable compensation, marketing and other discretionary expenses. to help you better understand, within these categories, there is roughly $150 million of variable or discretionary expenses on an annual basis. now i do not want to lead you to believe it is possible to immediately reduce this level of expense dramatically over a very short term, but this is where we can have an impact to manage these expenses in order to mitigate revenue shortfalls and protect our margins in a targeted manner. now let me add two comments to add more color as you look at margin and think about expenses.
first, most of you are familiar with this, but please remember to consider the accounting impact for gains or losses on assets held in the deferred compensation plan, assets that were nearly $108 million at june 30 this year. eliminating the accounting for gains or losses, operating income was 12.9% of revenue in the second quarter compared with 10.1% a year ago. and for the six months, operating income was 15.7% of revenue compared with 14.9% a year ago. and for further information, general and administrative expense was at 4.1% this year versus 4.6% in the second quarter a year ago. and year-to-date, 4.3% versus the same number, 4.3% a year ago, excluding the accounting for the gains or losses.
the second item i want to talk about reflects lower cbiz employee healthcare benefit costs in the first half of this year compared with prior year. like many companies, we self-insure this program and we accrue costs in line with estimates that are developed every year. normally, there is only minor volatility to this expense compared with estimates. but with the general deferral of routine procedures and medical care in connection with the covid-19 outbreak, our cbiz employee healthcare benefit costs were significantly lower in the first half this year by $3.2 million for the six months.
this lower cost accounts for about 1/2 of the $0.09 eps improvement we reported in the second quarter compared with a year ago, and about 1/2 of the year-to-date improvement of $0.08 per share. it is unclear that this reduction in healthcare costs in the first half will persist over the balance of the year, and so we are projecting a more normal expense pattern for the remainder of the year. bear this in mind as you evaluate our first half results and think about the balance of the year. now at the end of march, debt outstanding on the credit facility, net of cash, was $166.1 million. and at the end of june, debt outstanding net of cash, was $110.3 million, a $56 million improvement during the second quarter.
as a precautionary measure at the end of march, we had fully drawn down all available capacity under our $400 million credit facility. with the stability we have experienced with improving liquidity during the second quarter, we have since repaid all excess borrowings. at the end of june, we have approximately $270 million of undrawn capacity and leverage is at approximately onetime measured against trailing 12-month ebitda. we are watching customer collections on receivables very carefully as clients take actions to preserve their own liquidity. our client service team has done a nice job utilizing tools and weekly dashboards to focus on client communication and cash collections.
dso was 87 days at june 30 this year, and that compares to 90 days at the end of the second quarter a year ago. remember that dsos typically increase in the first half of the year as we build receivables and that liquidate into cash later in the year. capital spending for the second quarter was approximately $2.7 million, and for the first half, capital spending was approximately $5.3 million. full year, we expect total capital spending within a range of $10 million to $12 million. bad debt expense for the six months was 63 basis points of total revenue compared with 30 basis points a year ago. this increase reflects the additional $2 million bad debt reserve we recorded in the first quarter.
as reflected in the improvement in day sales outstanding, client payments are coming in as expected, and liquidity has improved, but we are continuing to carry this reserve as the level of uncertainty and risk remains. as jerry commented, our diverse industry exposure mitigates this risk. and the bad debt allowance we recorded is focused on those specific clients within food service, hospitality or travel-related businesses, and that represents less than 5% of our total client service revenue. in addition to the three acquisitions that we announced in the first quarter, we announced one additional acquisition effective on july 1, that will have an annualized revenue contribution of approximately $1.2 million.
for the first six months, acquisition-related spending was approximately $16 million. for the balance of this year, earn-out payments for acquisitions previously closed are estimated at approximately $7.9 million. and for next year 2021, approximately $9.6 million; for 2022, approximately $8.4 million; and for 2023, approximately $800,000 with approximately $200,000 scheduled in 2024. during the second quarter, we suspended share repurchases as we prepared for the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business. with the 1.2 million shares repurchased in the open market during the first quarter, we used approximately $29.5 million for this. and as a result, we expect our fully diluted share count of approximately 55.5 million shares for the full year.
our effective tax rate for the first half was 25.6%. and for the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate within a range of 24% to 25%. as jerry described, we took swift measures early in the second quarter to prudently manage costs and protect our liquidity. we generated good first half earnings and ebitda. cash flow is strong. liquidity has been preserved, and we are very well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to invest in long-term growth.
with the continued risk and uncertainty in the economy, we are also ready with contingency plans to address different scenarios that could unfold, should the need arise. as we navigate through this period of uncertainty, we are accomplishing our goal to preserve our liquidity. and we want to have the financial capacity to take advantage of acquisition and other investment opportunities that lie ahead, including share repurchases. we are pleased with the stability and performance of our core businesses. and as i outlined earlier, as we addressed the other business service lines that were impacted to a greater degree, we are taking actions so that when the economy recovers, we will be very well positioned for further growth.
so with those comments, i will conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i'd like to touch on a couple of additional areas before we turn it over for q&a, including a brief update on our response to covid-19 and where we stand today. our priority continues to be the health and safety of our team members and our clients. at the outset of the pandemic, we shifted approximately 95% of our team to working from home starting in mid-march. we are pleased with how quickly our team adapted to this change, especially with the adoption of new technologies to support video conferencing and virtual collaboration. we're now in the process of reopening our offices nationwide and welcoming our team members back.
starting in may, we began a phased approach to reopening our offices, which included new safety guidelines and protocols. we are now actively enforcing social distancing and requiring the use of mask in all shared and common office spaces. overall, we are being measured in our approach so we can continue to adapt and learn as we go. further, we are using everything we've learned so far through this experience to inform our planning for the future. this includes establishing the appropriate systems and guidelines to introduce more flexibility into where, when and how we work going forward. next, i want to briefly discuss our efforts around m&a.
so far this year, we've completed four transactions, and we started 2020 with a full pipeline of potential opportunities, including several pending transactions we placed on hold at the outset onset of the pandemic. we elected to put these transactions on hold at the time to both conserve cash but also to ensure that we could support the complete integration of these businesses into cbiz. we strive to create the best possible onboarding experience for our acquisitions. and we were concerned that we might not be able to have achieved this given the constraints in the early days of the pandemic. we are now in the process of actively reengaging these transactions while renewing efforts around our pipeline.
the actions we've discussed today ensure that we have the capital available to make strategic acquisitions and move quickly to be opportunistic in this changing environment. we believe that there will be new opportunities in the near term, especially given our firm's recent experience with covid-19. given the unique attributes of our business and our demonstrated resilience, i believe we can offer potential targets a level of stability and opportunities that many others cannot.
we can better articulate now the value of being part of large, well capitalized and resilient organization like cbiz, that is able to emerge even stronger from a crisis of this nature. looking forward, the key takeaway from today's call is that our current environment has validated cbiz' business strategy. what we've seen in this environment is that the right mix of core essential services and advisory and specialty services will give us the ability to perform well in the near term, regardless of the shape and pace of recovery, while maintaining our focus on long-term growth.
while we anticipate that some of our services would perform better than others in this situation, and that's exactly what we experienced, we believe that our advisory private equity and other specialty services will allow us to accelerate growth when conditions improve. every action that we've taken since the onset of the pandemic has been not only to protect the business in the short term, but to position us for long-term growth and success as well.
with that, i will now turn it back over for q&a.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from andrew nicholas of william blair. please go ahead.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
hi, good morning. i wanted to start with just an update on client retention. is there any detail you can provide on that front, how it progressed over the course of the quarter? any color on july trends? i'm just i guess i'm particularly interested to the extent to which pressure on the smb market and your existing client base could impact the outlook for first half of next year?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
so andrew, it's jerry. as i said at the in my comments opening comments, we generally have about a 90% retention rate across all of our clients. and we're experiencing similar retention in this environment. there are a couple of small pockets of our clients that are being more impacted than others. we have a specific part of our property and casualty business that is specializes in program business for the hospitality airbnb and that type of an industry as well as action water sports and those types of things. that has been more impacted, although, again, when you take the aggregate amount of all of our clients in those spaces, it's less than 5% of our total revenue.
and we also saw a some impact on the some of our smaller clients within our payroll business, which hit its kind of peak as far as attrition in april, although it's recovered significantly since then. so all told, what i would say is, i believe the 90% retention rate across the board is holding for us. and i think the really positive note is that like we experienced in 2008 and '09, we're also seeing in this environment that our clients are extraordinarily resilient, and we're seeing that in this environment.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and as my follow-up, and i apologize if i missed this, there's a lot of good detail in the prepared remarks. but could you quantify how much revenue in the government healthcare consulting business fell out of the second quarter? and what your current expectations are in terms of realizing that revenue over the next two or three quarters?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. andrew. and i think the second part of your question is key because that revenue is not lost, it just gets pushed out. so what's happened is basically with the slowdown, cost reports and access to client information has slowed down into us. so our efficiencies have suffered a little bit as a result. for the first half, this business was relatively flat. and we typically say this grows in the mid to high-teen range. so we expect stronger...
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
mid- to high single digits.
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, i'm sorry. i misspoke. mid- to high single-digit range. so given that it was a flat first half for us, that's the deferral of revenue that will spill into the second half if things normalize and the conditions are more normal in the second half.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
and just as a follow-up, i mean, is your expectation now that third quarter will be more like traditional mid-single, high single-digit-type growth? or is this kind of the type of thing that would build up again next quarter and really kind of all catch up in the fourth quarter and early next?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. it's a little hard to tell, andrew, just given the pace of recovery and when we can get back on-site and the receptivity of our clients to allowing us to do more of this work virtually. but there is an expectation, as were said that this work will get done, whether it's the third quarter, fourth quarter or kind of flowing into 2021, it is essential services. we haven't lost these contracts. and we will get this work done. timing is a little bit more difficult to predict.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
great, thanks a lot.

our next question comes from chris moore of cjs securities. please go ahead.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. it was quite a good quarter. maybe a bit of a loaded question, but what's the biggest uncertainty at this point from keeping you guys from reinstating guidance? obviously, another big flare is one. but are there other areas where just visibility is just isn't there at this point in time?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes, chris, as you know, the second half of our year is more heavily reliant on project work. that work tends to be driven in large part by activities among our clients, acquisitions, capital expansion expenses and improvements. those things tend to be based on the confidence level of our clients as to market conditions and their opportunities within those market conditions.
and as we go out and speak with them, which we always do, what we're hearing from them, like others kind of throughout the country is that while they always tend to be optimistic about their business and what the prospects are, they're less confident about what's going on today in the economy, and they really can't predict or are reluctant to predict when they might, again, begin to expand their businesses and make those types of investments. so all of that translates into that will impact one way or another, the amount of project work we do in the second half. and we just don't have a basis for trying to estimate what that might be.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
fair enough. makes sense. towards the end of your prepared remarks, jerry, you were talking about the m&a opportunity. and you can't get too specific, but it sounds like things really were or are ramping there. you have a sense yet whether or not some of these targets are still available? and is that potentially should we look to be seeing more in the second half of this year?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
well, as always, it's difficult to predict the timing of the closing. but let me answer your first question first, which is, are they still in the pipeline? the answer is yes. none of the transactions that we of any size that we were having discussions with prior to the onset of the pandemic have dropped off that list. in fact, we've reengaged in all of those conversations. we're encouraged actually in a number of areas where while the mix of their revenue may have shifted, their revenue has held up quite nicely in this environment, which gives us confidence that with the stability of that business, in those, in particular, are our discussions that we are pursuing more actively in this environment.
in addition, we believe, as we said at the in the first quarter notes, that there's going to be opportunities for us to have discussions with very highly regarded competitors, particularly on the accounting side, where in the past, we would speak with them and they there was a real connection with cbiz. they liked our story. we had ongoing dialogue, but they were doing so well that there was no need for them to really make a decision at that point.
they many of them have now seen how advantageous it is to have the scale, the geographic diversity, the industry diversity, the breadth of services that we've all been able to bring or cbiz has been able to bring to our clients and that message is resonating with them today in ways that it may not have resonated before. and so we're now initiating conversations with some of those really highly regarded prospects in the market that we're very, very encouraged by.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thanks guys.
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thanks, christian.

[operator instructions] and our next question comes from marc riddick of sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
good morning, mark.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i was wondering if you'd touch a little bit on and i know it's a very different circumstance. but as you recall, last year, we had the delayed filing activity. and i think if i remember properly, i think you had maybe mentioned that there was about a 10% i'm trying to remember if it was 10% that had chosen to 10% growth year-over-year of those who have chosen to file extensions. did you i was wondering if you had anything similar, if you could sort of talk about maybe what the filing extension activity is this year versus last? and how it might be the same and how it might be different? and then i have a follow-up on that.
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. thanks, marc. that's a good question. we do measure that, the number of extensions, the percentage of returns that are on extension and for different reasons, they are at about the same levels this year compared to last year. last year, it was a result of tax reform. this year, it's the result of the cares act, but we're at about the same levels.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then i was wondering shifting gears into some of the client needs and sort of how that's morphed and evolved during the course of the year. and the challenges that they face. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing of those addressing those needs and sort of how you what how we should be thinking about what that pricing dynamic might look like and what it might look like going forward should further covid-19-related small business needs evolve. i was wondering if you could spent a little bit of time talking about that.
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. let me take it in two pieces here. first of all, the immediate work that we did for our clients to help them assess the relief package that were in the market and particularly the work that we helped them with in applying for the loans. that tended to be lower margin work for us. but it was important, nonetheless, because certainly, it helped to preserve the client. it certainly helped to strengthen the client relationship. it also helped us to get in front of prospects that weren't receiving that level of support from from the competitors in the market, from their other service providers.
and so it was important to us on a lot of fronts, albeit at a somewhat lower realization rate. the second part, and again, more encouragingly is that our pipeline as a result of all of the work that we did, the spadework that we did during that period of time, the webinars, the thought leadership, the digital outreach, our pipeline, the top of the funnel for prospects is at an all-time high. now historically, that it takes a while to convert that pipeline into closings, and we're seeing that, right? we're working through that pipeline.
but that work that is converting is at our is at a higher rate than the initial work that we did and at the rates that we would expect to receive. so a little early to tell how this all shakes out. but important for us to do the work that we did in the early stages to help support our clients for all the reasons we indicated and very encouraging from both the size of the pipeline and the work that we're that's coming out of that tends to be higher rate, higher margin.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. that's certainly helpful. and then in a way that kind of segues into what i kind of always ask about is, i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your marketing plans and spend and maybe what you've seen there or if you have any thoughts there? the tricky part of these things as far as gaining new customers is it's sometimes hard to parse out what to give credit to. but certainly, you'd undergone the brand building efforts. and i was wondering if you could sort of update us on that and what that would look like going forward?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. so the discussion over the past several years has been around our national branding campaign. as we indicated in the first quarter, when covid started, we put that on hold really to conserve as part of our focus on conserving cash as we've reported, as were reported. we feel very comfortable there. so if you took the political cycle out of here, which means that advertising during that period of time, third quarter and fourth quarter is going to be very costly. we would be considering at this point, reinitiating some of that because we have the ability to do it, and we think it's important to continue to do that on an ongoing basis.
although we have suspended our national branding campaign, i believe we've more than made up for that in all of the other things that we've done during this period of time that i've referenced earlier, which is the webinar programs which have been highly successful. we continue them to this day. the digital outreach we've had and other efforts that we've had to go into the market and really tell our story because of this unique environment has really, i think, gone a long way in helping to build our brand across the board.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then the last one for me. i was wondering and thank you for giving the details around the how you see the acquisition pipeline developing in those conversations. is there any particular regional mix that you're seeing any differently than maybe you might have looked at, at the beginning of the year as far as targeted areas or opportunities or anything that might be driven by different regions experiencing different financial characteristics?
jerome grisko -- president, chief executive officer
no. the answer is we really our strategy holds. our strategy is to look at very attractive geographic markets based on the demographics of that market. we're always interested in those and remain interested. we have not seen a particular we've not been in discussions with a particular target in a geography that has been disproportionately impacted based on this environment, if that's really the question. so as i responded earlier, in fact, a number of the more promising acquisitions targets that we've been talking to have actually held up quite well in this environment. they're in different geographies, but they've actually held up quite well. so we're encouraged by that.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thank you very much for the color.

operator
good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for the cbiz third quarter and nine months conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to lori novickis director of corporate relations. please go ahead.
lori novickis -- director, corporate relations

i will now turn the call over to jerry for his opening remarks, jerry.
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, lori, good morning everyone. i am pleased to speak with you this morning about the very strong results that we experienced for the third quarter and year-to-date. but before i get into the details on our performance, there are a few key points that i would like to emphasize, starting with the resilience of our business. as we expected, the fundamental characteristics of our business have allowed us to continue to perform well in the current economic environment.
demand for our core accounting in many of our core benefits and insurance services remains strong. these are central and recurring services which make up approximately 70% of our revenue, have fueled our performance through this quarter and from the start of the pandemic. we are also starting to see increasing demand for a number of our advisory more project-based services. these were areas where we experienced some decline in the first and second quarters. our financial results were bolstered by the prudent responses to expense management that we put in place at the onset of the pandemic and the proactive steps that we've taken throughout the last nine months to protect the company. these moves have been effective in allowing us to preserve the substantial investments that we've made over the years in our team which will position us to accelerate growth when the economy begins to improve.
we also continue to be proactive with our outreach to our clients and our prospects. our clients turn to us for advice and solutions in times of change and uncertainty, and we've been hard at work over the past nine months to help them mitigate the challenges and pursue the opportunities presented by the current business climate. for example, earlier this year, we mobilized quickly to help our clients understand and access the wide range of federal stimulus and relief programs like the payroll protection plan and the main street lending program. we are watching current discussions around the new economic stimulus package carefully and are prepared to once again assist our clients in taking advantage of opportunities as they become available.
these efforts allow us to expand and strengthen our client relationships, which ultimately leads to higher retention rates. similarly, our timely thought leadership in digital marketing efforts have resonated with prospects. the breadth and depth of our services and expertise and our ability to provide holistic solutions truly differentiates us from many of our competitors and this led to a full pipeline of prospects. a great example of our ability to offer more comprehensive in correlated services is the recent launch of our accelerated recovery webinar programs. these programs feature cbiz experts on topics that can help our prospects respond to their most pressing issues, make better decisions and act on them to advance critical strategies for their own recovery.
the market response has been overwhelmingly positive as prospects recognized how cbiz can provide value quickly in a wide range of areas. overall, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance given the unique circumstances that the current business climate presents. the quarter played out as expected with the changes in adjustments we've made having the intended effect. for the third quarter of 2020 revenue was $238.4 million, a slight decrease of $1.4 million over the same period in 2019. however, income from continuing operations improved by 12.5% and ebitda increased by 8.3% for the most recent third quarter compared to the same period a year ago. from a year-to-date perspective, we recorded revenue of $752.8 million, an increase of $7.5 million over the prior year. income from continuing operations improved by 8.6% and adjusted ebitda improved by 7.6% over the same period in 2019.
within our financial services segment, our core accounting and tax services continued to perform well, which reflects the steady demand for these essential services. as expected, the extension of tax filing deadline from april 15, to july 15, shifted revenue from the first and second quarters to the third quarter. that work is now completed and we would expect that the remaining revenue related to tax plant work to be relatively consistent with more normal years. our results within this segment also reflect continued strong performance from our litigation support practices. in the second quarter, we know that m&a transactions were largely put on hold as most businesses shifting their focus to addressing issues brought on by the pandemic. these delays impacted a number of our advisory services that focus on transaction support. recently, we have seen signs of improved activity in this area, which is good news for a number of our advisory services businesses.
turning to our government healthcare consulting business. while we continue to experience reasonable growth within this business, the rate of growth has slowed as a result of covid-related issues. on our last call, we talked at length about the slowdown down and delivery of information from our clients and constraints around being onsite to complete certain aspects of the work. while we ended the third quarter in a better place than when we started and the demand for these services remains strong, the timing of certain work will remain a question in an area that we will continue to monitor closely. some of that work may be delayed into 2021 and we will know more as we progress through the fourth quarter.
within our benefits and insurance segment, we are seeing strong performance from our employee benefits business, our 401k advisory business and the personal and commercial lines portions of our property and casualty insurance business. we have experienced some softness in our payroll business related to early decline in the number of people on payroll of certain clients based on layoffs and leaves. after the initial drop in april, the number of pays improved in may and has remained fairly stable since that time. also, our clients and prospects continue to express interest in our new upmarket payroll platform and our pipeline of new business with this product is very encouraging. before i turn it over to ware to provide more specific details on our financials, i wanted to take a few minutes to talk about two acquisitions that we completed in the quarter.
we've completed five acquisitions so far this year and we started the year with the strongest pipeline of opportunities in recent history. while we caused our m&a efforts at the onset of the pandemic, our most recent transactions demonstrate our readiness to pursue strategic opportunities and our ability to close transactions in this business climate. on our last call at the end of july, i touched briefly on the acquisition of prince-wood insurance, an independent agency and leading provider of financial insurance and advisory services located in woodbridge, virginia. prince-wood is the second property and casualty insurance related acquisition so far this year as we continue and invest in areas of our business like property and casualty insurance that have been strong contributors to our historic growth.
in september we also completed the acquisition of arc consulting and arc placement group, apg. both companies located in san francisco, california. the acquisition of arc and apg adds to our advisory services capabilities within our financial services group. arc consulting assist finance departments with complex accounting reporting and compliance needs that require a high level of technical knowledge, including gaap and sec requirements. the arc team is often engaged to assist clients with complex capital structures with the potential for public offering or strategic exit. apg focuses on an interim and direct placement of finance and accounting channel to meet the needs of arc's clients. this acquisition was already under way when the pandemic hit. rather than moving forward at that uncertain time, we put the deal on hold as we continued to monitor their performance.
we were pleased to see the resilience in their business during this timeframe and we moved quickly to complete the transaction in the summer. the expansion of advisory services within our financial services group is another critical step to establish the right mix of services to respond to our clients and prospects increasingly complex needs. our mix of core essential services along with the advisory and specialty services, has enabled us to maintain our performance while positioning the business to long-term growth. in many ways, our experience in 2020 has further validated cbiz's business strategy. strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important part of our efforts for short-term recovery within the business as well as long-term growth.
towards the end of the second quarter, we reactivated our m&a sourcing team and are in discussions with a number of very attractive acquisition prospects. we believe that there will be new opportunities in the near term especially given companies' and firms' recent experience with covid-19. given the unique attributes of our business and our demonstrated resilience, i believe we can offer potential targets a level of stability and opportunity that many others cannot. we can better articulate now the value of being part of a large well-capitalized and resilient organization like cbiz that is able to emerge even stronger from the current economic environment.at this point, i will turn it over to ware grove, our cfo, to provide more specific details on our financial performance for the third quarter and year-to-date there. ware?
ware h. grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, jerry, and good morning everyone. i want to take a few minutes to review the highlights of the numbers we released this morning and talk about the actions we have taken as we navigate through covid-related challenges. as jerry commented, the majority of our core businesses are performing well. through our diversity of clients that we serve, coupled with the recurring and essential nature of our core services has providing stability to our results.
reported total growth has impacted by a small number of businesses within our mix of services that are more severely impacted by covid-related influences either because these services are project-oriented, they are more directly impacted by the higher unemployment trends or they are more highly dependent upon travel-related or client-facing activities. for example, looking at those services most severely impacted we can identify unique areas of our business that comprise approximately 15% of our nine months revenue this year. spread between both the financial services and the benefits and insurance practice groups, collectively, these businesses reported a decline of $12.9% in revenue for the nine months. to illustrates the stability of the remaining 85% of the core services, when you eliminate the impact of those businesses that have been more severely impacted the remaining core cbiz revenue grew by an adjusted 4.1% with same unit revenue growing by an adjusted 1.9% for the nine months ended september 30, this year.
within financial services for the third quarter total revenue was up 1.1% with same unit revenue flat from a year ago. for the nine months, total revenue within financial services was up 1% with same unit revenue also flat. revenue in core tax and accounting services has grown but we have also recorded modest growth in the government health-care consulting business where growth has slowed a bit this year due to disruptions in the availability of cost reports and other information or limited access to client sites that we need under normal circumstances. this work still needs to be done and some portion of this work may push into 2021.
within the advisory or project oriented businesses and financial services activity is rebounding as travel restrictions are lifting and the outlook is improving. turning to benefits and insurance, total revenue for the third quarter declined by 4%. the same unit revenue declined by 6%. for the nine months ended september 30, total revenue grew by 0.9% and same unit revenue declined by 2.9%. similar fashion with financial services a portion of the benefits and insurance business is impacted by covid-related factors, including higher unemployment trends. the core recurring services such as group health benefits, property and casualty, commercial coverage or retirement investment advisory services, have been very stable. retention in these businesses has been solid this year and the new producer investments we have been making are having a very positive impact.
there is a pool of variable cost within the business and we have carefully managed cost this year with an eye toward making prudent decisions, appropriate for the circumstances but also avoiding across the board actions such as risks or other actions that may compromise our ability to grow once more normal conditions return. improved margins have resulted from lower costs, which include a natural reduction in travel-related expense, lower marketing and event sponsorship costs, lower variable compensation levels, lower benefits and healthcare costs and other actions to defer discretionary items where possible. beyond these cost reductions, we've also taken very targeted actions to right-size costs in those operations that have been more impacted by economic conditions this year.
as you think about the cost structure and the margins as an important reminder, it is important to eliminate the impact of accounting for gains and losses on the assets held in the deferred compensation plan. as a reminder, this does not change the reported margin on pre-tax income but elements of operating income are impacted. eliminating the impact of gains or losses for the third quarter, gross margin was 16.4% compared with 15.6% a year ago. general administrative expense was 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.6% a year ago. for the nine months, gross margin was 18.9% compared with 18% and general and administrative expense was 4.3% compared with 4.4% for the nine months a year ago.
in our second quarter conference call, i commented on the favorable impact of lower benefits costs. as with many others, we've experienced favorable adjustments to healthcare cost this year resulting from the general covid-related deferral healthcare that has occurred since march. for the third quarter and for the nine months this favorable item accounts for about 40% of the increase in pre-tax income compared with the prior year. under normal circumstances, there may be some minor adjustments to this estimated cost throughout the year and the favorable adjustment to costs through the first nine months this year, may not recur as the economy and individual behaviors return to normal in the future. importantly, cash flow has remained positive this year. at the end of september, outstanding debt on our $400 million unsecured credit facility was $110 million and that leaves $284 million of unused capacity.
client cash remittances continue to be stable with days sales outstanding, improving to 87 days this year, compared with 94 days at september 30, a year ago. earlier this year, we recorded an additional $2 million of bad debt reserve at the end of march. for the nine months, bad debt expense was 42 basis points of revenue compared with 26 basis points for the nine months a year ago. the additional reserve recorded at the end of the first quarter anticipated a higher risk generally associated with those clients whose business is focused on travel, entertainment or restaurant associated industries. with our diverse set of clients, these types of clients represent less than 5% of our client base. acquisition-related spending including earn-outs paid on previously closed acquisitions totaled $48.8 million through september 30. for the balance of this year, we expect to pay an additional $3.7 million.
for 2021, we expect to pay approximately $12.4 million and for 2022, we expect to pay approximately $11.3 million for earn-out payments on acquisitions previously closed. then for 2023, an additional $3.7 million is planned and for 2024, approximately $3.1 million. acquisitions continue to be our highest priority as the best long-term use of our capital. however, we also have the flexibility to repurchase shares. after suspending share repurchase activity near the end of the first quarter, since that time we have experienced strong cash flows. as a result during the third quarter, we elected to resume share repurchase activity. we initiated a 10b repurchase program during september and we repurchased approximately 165,000 shares through september 30. in october, we have repurchased an additional 166,000 shares.
combined with the 1.2 million shares that were repurchased in the first quarter of this year, to date through october 27, we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $37 million. considering this recent share repurchase activity, we are projecting the full year, weighted average share count at approximately 55.5 million shares for 2020. capital spending in the third quarter was approximately $4.1 million and for the nine months, capital spending was approximately $9.6 million. full-year capital spending is expected at approximately $12 million this year. the effective tax rate for the nine months was 25.7% and for the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate within a range of 24% to 25%. as we navigate through this challenging environment, we are pleased with the steady performance of our business.
we are extremely pleased to record improved margins with a 9.3% growth in earnings per share for the nine months ended september 30 of this year. as a reminder, fourth quarter results are typically more dependent upon project work, and that may lead to volatility in the fourth quarter results. with ongoing risks and uncertainty in the months ahead, we continue to prudently manage costs. where portions of our business have been more severely impacted, we are continually assessing the business and have taken more targeted actions. we are ready with further contingency plans, if necessary. most importantly, with a strong cash flow attributes of our business, our liquidity is stable. we have the capacity, we are continuing to make investments in the business to enhance the long-term growth prospects for cbiz and we are well-positioned for growth once we get beyond the covid-related impact to the economy.
so with these comments, i will turn it back over to jerry.
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you. ware, i'd like to touch on a couple of additional areas before we turn it over for q&a. throughout the last nine months, there has been a great deal of discussion on how small businesses are likely to fare in the months ahead, given the impact of the pandemic. at cbiz, we serve a wide range of clients with varying sizes and across many industries and geographies. that diversity within the mix of clients that we serve, helps us to insulate against business conditions that have a disproportionate impact on certain client populations. moreover, while we do serve a large number of small businesses, a significantly larger portion of our revenues come from clients with annual revenues in excess of $20 million. businesses of this size have historically proven to be far more resilient than smaller businesses in an uncertain and challenging business climate, such as the one year now facing.
turning to the upcoming presidential and congressional elections. we've also received a number of questions around what different outcomes might mean for cbiz, our clients and the future of our business. throughout our 24-year history, we've been through a number of changes in our nation's administration and had a sustained growth regardless of who is in the white house, or the congress. regardless of the outcome of next week's selections, we expect to experience continued change in complexity in the laws and regulations that apply to our clients, which is good for our business as our clients turn to us to help them understand the impact of these changes on their businesses. finally, i want to provide a brief update on our efforts to make diversity and inclusion a central part of our cbiz culture.
earlier this summer, following the tragic death of george floyd, cbiz moved to develop a comprehensive long-term diversity and inclusion strategy that meaningful action and lasting change. we want to begin with those things that we can influence and, in some cases, control when it comes to our team, our culture and our company. we also hope to drive change within professional services industry and we intend to use cbiz's position and voice to join with other like-minded companies to be a catalyst for that change. too often we watched these kinds of efforts become more about checking boxes than taking action. we've taken some important first steps in this journey, which included signing onto the ceo action for diversity and inclusion pledge in september.
the ceo action for diversity and inclusion pledge was the largest ceo-driven business can limit to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace. signatories to the pledge include leaders from more than 1,000 of the world's most well-recognized companies and organizations, representing over 85 industries. by signing the pledge, the leaders of these companies have all committed to focus on a shared goal, to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace. i am proud to affirm my personal commitment to diversity and inclusion by signing of this effort. i believe our active participation with the ceo action for diversity and inclusion pledge will connect us with others and help to accelerate our work in this area.
with that, we will open it up to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question today will come from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. if you could just talk a little bit about pricing. just trying to understand, is pricing power much different between financial services and benefits and insurance, and what has the current environment during fiscal year 2020, what's pricing been versus typical?
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
chris, first of all, the pricing is a little bit different between the two divisions, as you know, within the benefits and insurance division, we often times are paid a commission, which is really a product of, or driven by the service that we provide, so a percentage of the premiums that the client may pay is a typical compensation system advantage to mature. so while not exclusive, we obviously have fees related to our payroll services and some of our advisory services, much of the revenue there is more commission-driven.
within our financial services group, we are often -- most of that revenue is in fact fee-driven and we have not seen or heard of a lot of fee pressure in this environment, really. i think what we've experienced is that our clients are turning to us for advice and as to how to navigate in this environment. and that advice is less fee-driven and more value-based on the expertise that we bring to bear, so not to say that it will come at some point in the future as we bid for work going into 2021, but so far to-date, i have not heard of significant fee pressure.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it, it's helpful. on the government healthcare front, demand is still strong, timing uncertain. again, is that mostly travel challenges or something else that's embedded in there? just trying to get a sense in terms of -- for the first nine months, how significantly impacted that business segment was?
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
so, as you know, we typically enjoy high single-digit organic growth year-over-year in that business. we are still experiencing nice growth in that business, and it continues to perform well and as you indicated, the work is there, the demand is high, we have had some covid-related challenges. they fall into two buckets, the one is the one that you identified, which is if we are required to be on-site to do certain work, that obviously has been somewhat impacted by this environment, although even in those instances, like many other companies in this environment, we're getting more comfortable with delivering network virtually.
our clients are able to work with us virtually, and so we're establishing a new workflow relative to work that was traditionally done on-site in many of those instances. the other kind of hurdle that we've begun to overcome here in that business is the fact that some of the state governments were given some latitude and some reprieve on when they were required to submit the background information and data that we need in order to do our work, and just, it was, as you would expect, just the product of other priorities. but that work also seems to be flowing more freely to us and we've had a couple of good months in that business. time will tell if there are further delays based on the impact of covid in various states and then in the various clients.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it and it's helpful. and last from me and it's a tough question, trying to get a sense, assuming no big covid shutdowns over the coming months, in terms of your expected visibility, would you expect to be in a position in february, from where you sit today, to give fiscal 2021 guidance?
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
you know, chris, i think it's too early to call that at this point, but certainly if there are no further covid shutdowns, if there is a vaccine on the horizon or may be in place by that time, we would hope that we could put guidance back in place as quickly as we can, given a more certain environment.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. i appreciate it. i'll jump back in line. thanks.

[operator instructions] the next question is from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti &amp -- analyst
hi, good morning. hello. i wanted to just go over a couple of things, a lot of which you covered on the prepared remarks, which is great. i wanted to see if you could just bring us up to speed, maybe on some of the decision-making that you may be experiencing, whether it'd be anecdotal or what have you, as to the waiting for the current lack of or potential stimulus, what you might be seeing as to what customers -- the response for them and what delays that may be, and their decision making that may have an impact on your business currently? and what you see that maybe playing out?
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
marc, this is jerry. obviously, there's lots of discussions around when that next wave of stimulus may be available. i think overwhelming sentiment is that it will come at some point, whether it's shortly after the election or early into 2021. i know that our clients are tracking that. i know that it would be helpful for many segments of the economy and certainly for a lot of our clients. but what i will say is that, it really shines a light on the value and the differentiated value that we can bring to our clients with a holistic approach, when we help them through the first wave of the ppp loans and the main street lending type programs that are available.
so we stand ready. we have our finger on the pulse of what might come, and as soon as it does come, we will mobilize as we did in the first instance to help our clients there. the second part of the question really is, how important is that to our clients. i will tell you that we have surveyed our clients informally, as well as we've had some client's panels that we've talked to and, not surprisingly, our clients are more optimistic than some of the newspaper reports and others may indicate. we tend to represent a very resilient segment of the population, as far as businesses are concerned, while they all had to readjust their businesses based on the current environment. i think the sentiment is more optimistic as they look forward. so i think that's been reflected in our results and we would expect that to continue to be the case going forward.
marc riddick -- sidoti &amp -- analyst
that's encouraging. and i was wondering if you could share a little bit of time talking about the longer-term market share opportunities? i mean, providing these services and being a trusted advisor at a challenging time certainly is a competitive differentiator and i wanted to get a sense of how you feel about the opportunity to gain a greater share of wallet from existing customers, bringing on new customers, as well as maybe if you could touch a little bit on, if you have any thoughts on those who were maybe outsourcing some things that they had been doing themselves up to this point with the greater complexity and how that could lead to new business into accounts going forward? thank you.
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
i'm going to take the questions in order. first of all, as to market share and how we are faring in this environment. actually yesterday, i believe, there was an article in accounting today, we were lead article there as to our unique value proposition relative to certainly many of our competitors, as to the breadth and depth of services that we're able to provide, and how well that's being received into the market. and so if you haven't seen it, i'm happy to send you a link to that article, but it did a very nice job of describing how uniquely positioned we are in this environment to bring more than just the monoline view and solution to our clients.
because, as you can imagine, the challenges that are being faced by many businesses are multi-disciplinary and there are really no others in the country that are as well-positioned as we are to bring a multi-disciplinary holistic approach, comprehensive approach to the solution. so as far as market share is concerned, we're very encouraged by the reception that we've received to our digital outreach through our webinars to our other thought leadership pieces going not only to our existing clients, but also the products. i'm sorry, prospects, and then the pipeline of new business opportunities that are flowing from that. so we are very encouraged by that. as to outsourcing, i will say we haven't seen a dramatic difference at least i haven't heard of a dramatic difference in and how receptive the market is to that although logically would say that in time like the ones that we're facing.
now, our clients are most interested in focusing on their core competencies and the things that they do best and looking to others to help them with things that that may not be a core competency, including outsourcing things not building not incurring net expense to build their own infrastructure and cost that turn to organizations like ours that already have made those investments that can help them through this thing. so i think all of that's at play right now and certainly a message that we're delivering to the market and again, we're very encouraged by the reception that we are receiving in the pipeline of opportunities that we see.
marc riddick -- sidoti &amp -- analyst
okay. and then one last one for me, i wanted to get a sense of, it's probably early, but maybe it's too early. maybe it's not, i'm not sure, but i wanted to get a sense of, as you look at current tax code changes what we have so far. is there a sense of what level of complexity that might look like year-over-year? i know we've had certain years where the complexity was far greater than others. i was wondering how that might look relative to maybe the last few years as far as the year-over-year changes of tax cuts? thank you.
jerome p. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
so as we look forward, right, it really kind of depends on what happens in the upcoming elections here. i think under regardless of what that outcome is there is likely to be changes in our tax cut. just as a result of all the stimulus and other dollars, other money that have been put in the economy and that was, have to be repaid at some point. so i think tax laws are likely to change as we said repeatedly over the year's complexity and change is good for our business, because it does two things.
our clients of course turn to us to help them understand how that impacts them and their businesses and we help them navigate those that analysis but maybe equally important, it really does i think shine a light on cbiz in our unique value proposition to prospects and it gives us an opportunity to go out and have that discussion and demonstrate how we could bring different levels of solutions to the clients in the prospects that their current provider may not be able to provide. so i think, whenever there is changes whenever there is complexity, it's good for us. we've proven that over the years and i think kind of regardless of what happens in the upcoming elections. we're likely to see range in complexity.
marc riddick -- sidoti &amp -- analyst
makes sense. i greatly appreciate the commentary. thank you very much.

jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, lori. good morning, everyone. with the release of our results this morning, we were pleased to announce growth in total revenue, income from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. throughout the past year, i emphasized the fundamental characteristics of our business that i believe enable us to continue to perform well in both favorable and less favorable business climates. as i described on our second quarter call, these characteristics include that approximately 70% of our revenue is generated from essential services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that we provide to our clients regardless of economic conditions in the market. we generally retain approximately 90% of our clients from year-to-year. we have a broad geographic footprint. we serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. we enjoy strong and constant cash flow and have a substantial amount of variable expenses in our business. our ability to grow throughout the challenging business climate that was 2020 is a testament to those characteristics, the strength of our business model and the agility and resilience of our team. as expected and reflected in our results, some of our businesses performed better than others in more uncertain and volatile business environments. generally, the essential services described earlier tend to continue to perform well even in more challenging business climates while certain more discretionary services are less predictable.
many of our more discretionary services are in higher demand when our clients are pursuing or making decisions around growth, such as acquisitions or significant expansion plans. we saw much of this play out during 2020. within our financial services group, we experienced strong performance from our core tax & accounting business and our litigation support business and continued steady performance from our government healthcare consulting business. we also experienced a slowdown in the second and third quarters in demand for certain of our more discretionary project-oriented services, such as our valuation business and portions of our private equity advisory practice. however, demand for many of those services began to rebound in the fourth quarter, particularly for those services that are tied to supporting our clients' pursuit of acquisition opportunities. one note on our government healthcare consulting practice. on our last call, we discussed how the rate of growth had temporarily slowed during covid due to restrictions of access to client facilities and delays in receiving client information.
in the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the rate of growth for that business resume to more normal levels, and we expect demand for the services provided by that business to remain strong throughout 2021. turning to our benefits and insurance group. we had a similar experience to our financial services group with strong performance from the essential services that we provide, including our employee benefits business, the commercial and personal lines portion of our property and casualty business, the advisory services we provide for our clients on the retirement plans and demand for our upmarket, more robust payroll platform. from a consolidated view, the solid results that we experienced for those services were somewhat clouded by the softer results from a relatively small portion of our property and casualty business tied to the hospitality and adventure sports, a decline in the number of payrolls processed for some of our smaller clients, particularly those tied to the restaurant industry and a number of other more project-oriented service lines. the encouraging note here is that we expect the portions of that business that were negatively impacted by the soft economic conditions to return to more normal growth levels once the economy improves. one last note as it relates to our benefits and insurance business. we have made substantial investments over the past several years in hiring, training and supporting new producers within this group.
those investments are essential to drive sustained long-term organic revenue growth. the early report card on those investments is very encouraging. and as a group, the new producers that we brought into this program are outperforming our projections. as a result, we are continuing to invest in our new producer program and to expand this program to other business lines. now looking forward, we enter into this year in a position of financial strength with a very strong balance sheet, low debt and ready access to capital. as we demonstrated in 2020, we also have a significant amount of variable expenses and considerable discretionary spending items that we can manage to preserve liquidity, if economic conditions are worse than currently anticipated.
while much remains uncertain, we expect client demand for our core essential services to remain strong and for client interest in many of our more discretionary services to increase as business conditions continue to improve. based on our performance in 2020, the financial strength of the business, the cost control measures that we have at our command and our current view of the business climate for 2021, we have elected to reinstate guidance for this year. i want to caution that while we are comfortable issuing annual guidance, we do expect more volatility than we ordinarily experience when comparing a given quarter to the same period in the prior year. so we would caution against doing so. our decision to reinstate guidance is based on a couple of key assumptions that shape our outlook for 2021. these assumptions include the first six to nine months of 2021 will be similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2020, and we expect continued recovery in the m&a market, which impacts many of our more project-based and private equity services. we saw improvement in the fourth quarter and expect this trend to continue throughout 2021.
at this point, i will turn it over to ware grove, our cfo, to provide more specific details on our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. ware?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. i want to take a few minutes to run through further details and the highlights of the numbers we released this morning. the total revenue growing by 1.6% for the full year and margin on pre-tax earnings from continuing operations increasing by 90 basis points. we were pleased to report earnings per share of $1.42 for the full year, up 11.8% over $1.27 reported a year ago. to recap a few important points. as the impact of the covid pandemic unfolded, there was considerable risk and uncertainty everywhere. we took a number of immediate actions to protect our liquidity, and we took measures to prudently control expenses with a view toward preserving our ability to serve clients in order that we could emerge as a strong and healthy business ready to resume growth. we have not been completely immune, but with many actions we took, coupled with the dedication of our cbiz team, we are pleased that our business model has weathered the storm, and we are now a stronger company for the experiences in 2020. our primary concern operating under the pandemic environment was to protect our liquidity. perhaps the best measure of our success in 2020 is the continuing nature of our strong positive cash flow. we ended 2020 with $108 million of outstanding debt on our credit facility, increasing only $2.5 million from $105.5 million at year-end a year ago.
after an active first quarter in 2020, repurchasing 1.2 million shares and closing three acquisitions, we paused both acquisitions and share repurchase activity from mid-march through mid-september until we could develop more confidence with the stability of our cash flow trends. for the full year of '20, we closed seven acquisitions and utilized $89.7 million of capital for acquisition activities. we also deployed $57.6 million to repurchase approximately 2.3 million shares for the full year, including the repurchase of one million shares in the fourth quarter. for the full year, with $147.3 million of capital used for these two purposes, our borrowing increased by only $2.5 million. this results in a leverage ratio of approximately 0.8 times on adjusted ebitda of $132.1 million, with $286 million of unused capacity. going into '21, this offers us great flexibility to continue to deploy capital for acquisitions and for continuing our share repurchase activity. through february 16 to date this year, we have repurchased an additional 600,000 shares, and we intend to continue to repurchase shares. with this recent activity, when combined with shares repurchased in 2020, this has resulted in the repurchase of more than 5% of our shares outstanding. when you also consider the 1.2 million shares repurchased in the prior year 2019, we have repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares or roughly 7.5% of shares outstanding within the past two years, and we've utilized nearly $100 million of capital for these activities.
considering our strong balance sheet and cash flow attributes, we can repurchase this level of shares without compromising our capacity for acquisitions. with the seven acquisitions closed in 2020, plus an eighth transaction we announced effective on january one this year, collectively these newly acquired operations will generate approximately $48 million of annualized revenue. strategically, these acquired operations will further strengthen benefits and insurance services. we'll add an important component to our financial advisory services and we'll add capacity in order to accelerate the rollout of our integrated payroll services platform that focuses on upmarket clients. acquisition-related payments for earn-outs from previously closed transactions are estimated at $13.6 million in 2021. in 2022, we estimate a use of approximately $15.4 million, approximately $9.1 million in 2023, $13 million in 2024 and approximately $800,000 in 2025. for 2020, capital spending for the full year was $11.7 million, of which $2.2 million was in the fourth quarter. we expect capital spending within a range of $12 million to $15 million, looking ahead into 2021. depreciation and amortization expense for the full year of '20 was $23.1 million, $9.6 million of depreciation with $13.5 million of amortization. in the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization expense was $5.9 million. a major concern for us as the pandemic unfolded in 2020 was our clients' ability to pay receivables.
as we transition to remote work conditions at the end of the first quarter in 2020, our team did a great job refining and adopting new processes and digital tools for billing and management of receivables. these tools are now a more permanent fixture in our workflow processes and in our communication with clients. days sales outstanding performance on receivables improved this past year despite the volatile conditions and financial stress throughout the economy. at the end of the year, days sales outstanding stood at 72 days compared with 75 days a year earlier. although not completely immune to financial stress, this is also good evidence that with our diverse client base, there is no significant concentration of clients in the more severely impacted areas of the economy, such as hospitality, travel, restaurant or entertainment businesses. at the end of the first quarter in 2020, we recorded an additional $2 million of reserve for bad debt. with continuing uncertainty in the economy, although days sales outstanding performance has improved, we continue to carry that level of reserves for bad debt. for the full year of '20, bad debt expense was 45 basis points of total revenue compared with 25 basis points of total revenue for 2019. total consolidated revenue for the full year was up 1.6%, with same unit revenue declining slightly by 0.4%. in the fourth quarter, total revenue grew by 3.9% and same unit revenue grew by 1.1%. within financial services, total revenue for the full year was up 2.1%, with same unit revenue up 0.8%. in the fourth quarter, total revenue in financial services was up 6.6% with same unit revenue up 3.3%.
turning to benefits and insurance. for the year, total revenue grew by 0.5%, with same unit revenue declining by 3%. and in the fourth quarter, revenue declined by 0.8% and same unit revenue declined by 3.2%. as i indicated in our third quarter conference call, revenue growth numbers were impacted by a relatively small number of our operations, where the nature of advisory or transactional services was more severely impacted by economic conditions. for the full year, these businesses represented 16% of our total revenue, but collectively, these businesses declined by 12.8% in 2020 compared with the prior year. adjusting total revenue to exclude the impact of these businesses, the remaining core revenue would reflect growth of 4.9% rather than the 1.6% reported. same unit revenue would reflect growth of 2.5% rather than the 0.4% decline reported. fourth quarter revenue adjusted to exclude these businesses, grew by 8.3% versus the reported 3.9% and same unit revenue grew by 4.7% versus the reported 1.1%. with pre-tax income margin improving by 90 basis points to 10.7% from 9.8% the prior year, we saw a favorable impact resulting from the cost control measures we took in deferring discretionary items, plus the favorable impact from the natural reduction in travel, entertainment expense and from the lower cost for our self-funded healthcare benefits. among other things, for 2020, t&e costs came in at approximately 30% of the prior year levels, and healthcare costs came in at approximately 85% of expectations as discretionary and elective medical procedures were deferred.
adjusting the reported operating margin to remove the impact of accounting for gains and losses on assets held in the deferred compensation plan, operating income was 11.2% for the full year, up 70 basis points compared with 10.5% in 2019. as jerry outlined, we think business conditions in 2021 will look very much like the environment we experienced during the second half of 2020. of course, the timing and impact of a successful covid vaccination rollout is very unclear, and there is still risk and uncertainty ahead. considering the stability and performance of our core businesses in 2020, together with the impact of recent acquisitions, we think revenue will continue to grow in a similar matter, as i just described. we are projecting total revenue growth in 2021 within a range of 5% to 8%. as a reminder, we do not provide guidance for quarterly results. but as you think about the year ahead, bear in mind, the first quarter last year was a relatively strong quarter before we felt a covid impact in the second half of march. with the 5% to 8% revenue growth expectation, we are looking to increase earnings per share within a range of 8% to 12% over the $1.42 recorded for 2020. consistent with our longer-term goals, we can manage a number of discretionary items, and we expect to improve margin within a range of 20 to 50 basis points. you will note the effective tax rate was 24.3% in 2020. aside from any change in tax law that may arise from the new administration, there are a number of variables that can impact our tax rate, either up or down. but as we look ahead to 2021, we are projecting a 25% effective tax rate.
ongoing share repurchase activity will impact the fully diluted weighted average share count. at this time, we are estimated 54.5 million fully diluted shares for the full year, down from 55.4 million shares in 2020. as i mentioned, we are continuing to repurchase shares, and we will update this estimate at the end of the first quarter and throughout the year. adjusted ebitda for 2020 came in at $132.1 million or 13.7% of revenue, a 9.6% increase from the prior year, and we expect to further improve that margin in '21. so in conclusion, we were pleased to see stability in client demand and cash flow as we progress through the year. we have emerged from the challenge of 2020 as a stronger company with stronger processes. going into 2021, we think our business will continue to reflect the stability, evidenced by the performance this past year. we recognize the uncertainty and risks ahead, and we will plan to update our expectations as conditions dictate throughout the balance of the year.
so with these comments, i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i'd like to touch on a couple of additional areas before we turn it over for q&a. first, i would like to talk about our unique position in the market and how it allows us to provide solutions to our clients that are unmatched in our industries. while we have a large number of very capable competitors for many of the services we provide, they are often not aligned and lack the ability to provide the holistic, multidisciplinary solutions that our clients need when analyzing decisions that relate to their most impactful opportunities or greatest challenges. we witnessed the strength of our business model throughout 2020 as we move quickly to collaborate across businesses, service lines and geographies to bring cbiz's resources and expertise to bear in coordinated services that were responsive to our clients' most pressing needs. we are encouraged by the value that our holistic multidisciplinary solutions approach brings to our clients and are excited for the opportunities that it presents for cbiz to further distinguish us from our competitors. next, relating to m&a. we welcome two outstanding organizations to our team in the fourth quarter. the acquisition of beyondpay brings additional implementation capacity to support sales of our upmarket payroll solution and follows another similar acquisition earlier in 2020. we also acquired borden perlman insurance agency within our property and casualty business. based in new jersey, borden perlman is a leading provider of property and casualty insurance with an over 100-year history of serving clients on the east coast.
both of these acquisitions provide strategic value, but are also strong cultural fits, which is the most important factor when we consider acquisition opportunities. as ware mentioned, overall, we completed seven acquisitions in 2020, all of which bring expertise, capacity, talent and a strong client base to our business. as i mentioned earlier, in 2021, we've already completed one acquisition with our core accounting and tax practices with the addition of middle market advisory group in denver, colorado. mma provides tax complying and consulting services to middle market companies and family groups across a number of attractive industries and complements our rapidly growing colorado practice. acquisitions continue to be an essential component of our growth strategy. while the m&a market slowed in the second and third quarters of last year, we are seeing activity resume. we are finding that our performance throughout the pandemic allows us to tell a compelling story when it comes to potential partners. the challenges faced by many of our smaller competitors throughout covid shined a light on the value that cbiz can bring to our team members and our clients as a result of our scale, breadth and depth of services and expertise. as a result, our pipeline of outstanding acquisition prospects is stronger than it has been in many years, and we have access to capital to be aggressive as we seek to take advantage of many of these opportunities as we can.
with this, i will turn the call over for q&a.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning, guys. maybe just talk a little bit more about the quarterly volatility, specifically how it relates to q1. so the midpoint guided revenue is 6.5%. does that apply to q1 is the reason to think given the strong q1 '20 that the growth in q1 might be toward the lower end of the range? or any thoughts there?
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. chris, it's jerry. hey, before i kind of comment on the specific question, i made note in my opening comments that we're really guiding to annual -- we have an annual guidance. we really caution against any quarterly comparison. i think this is going to be a far less predictable year. any quarter-to-quarter i think is going to be very difficult for us to be able to predict with any type of certainty or predicality. and as we sit here today, particularly as it relates to the first quarter, you're right. we came out last year in 2020 with a very, very strong quarter. and we think that's going to be a particularly challenging quarter to compare to this year. but again, we'd really like to dissuade you from comparing quarter-to-quarter. we're very comfortable with our annual guidance, but quarterly comparisons are going to be a challenge for us.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. that helps. i appreciate that. ware had talked about, and you guys have in the past, that kind of some of the expenses that were lower in fiscal '20 versus '21, healthcare and travel, i guess just a couple of things. do you expect those levels to still be kind of below, say, a normal 2019? and were there any kind of covid-related expenses in '20 that may not be repeating in '21?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. chris, this is ware. with respect to the healthcare costs, that's not so controllable. and we would expect while we got a favorable cost reduction last year just because of the dynamics of the healthcare industry and the deferral of a lot of treatments our costs were lower, we're planning and expect that those will normalize back to 2019-type levels, ok? with respect to travel and entertainment, we're still on kind of modified work conditions as is the entire economy so that while we got a pretty dramatic reduction last year just because we were on pretty severe lockdown situation for a period of time. that will creep back up, but it's still very controllable here, and we're expecting that that will creep back maybe half of the distance between 2019 and 2020, but not the entire amount, but we can still manage that. those are a couple of the big issues.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and were there any kind of -- any covid-related expenses that may not necessarily repeat in '21?
ware grove -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
i think the thing to bear in mind there, not necessarily expenses, but the impact on our business. in the first quarter, i commented on the impact on our advisory businesses and some of the p&c program businesses, things like that, that were more severely impacted. those had a relatively stronger first quarter before they were impacted late in the first quarter and through the balance of the year. so that's why we caution against the quarterly comparables. but that's where we felt the slowdown in those select businesses.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. i appreciate it. i'll jump back into line.
operator
our next question comes from andrew nicholas with william blair. please go ahead.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
hi. good morning. just wanted to start with a question on client retention. just wondering if you could provide any additional color on how it progressed over the course of the fourth quarter? and then any color on year-to-date trends or kind of how you're thinking about that through this year? and relatedly, how it kind of compares to this time last year?
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. andrew, this is jerry. as you know, we generally enjoy very favorable client retention rates in the 90 percentile range across our business lines. holistically, as a company, we actually -- when we went back and measured those things, we actually improved those retention rates in many of our service lines. not surprisingly, many of the clients weren't thinking about changing service providers during that environment. however, that was somewhat offset by some of the attrition that we did see in certain of the very specialized practices we have like the program business that we have within property and casualty that really serves the hospitality industry and the action sports industry.
so within our core services, i would say our -- our retention rates actually improved throughout 2020. but our total as a company retention rates remained in about that 90 percentile range just because of some of the offsets. look, i think we would expect that going into 2021 that the attrition that we saw in some of the businesses, that's kind of behind us, the program business, for example, on property and casualty, and we would continue to enjoy very strong retention rates in our core services into 2021.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and maybe as my follow-up, sticking with the one thing that you touched on there in your response. just the services most directly impacted by the pandemic. i think in the prepared remarks, there was a comment about 16% of revenue being down 13% or so in 2020. just wondering -- i think you mentioned some improvement in the fourth quarter there and to start the year. just wondering kind of what you're thinking about in terms of a growth rate for that same subset of business in 2021, what's embedded in guidance? and to the extent that vaccines take hold and the economy improves, if there's any upside in that area that's not baked in? thanks.
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
so andrew, again, this is jerry. what i would say is that it's hard to take any particular segment of our business and really predict exactly how that's going to perform in this environment. what i would say as far as the growth rates are concerned, when we set our guidance, we looked at it at the highest level, knowing that things are going to come in different than we expect them to come in, in any given segment of our business, but we are comfortable at the highest level with the guidance that we provided. so it would be difficult for us to give you very specific guidance on a particular segment of the business.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
understood. thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. wanted to get a sense of the -- i appreciate some of the commentary -- hey there. i appreciate some of the commentary that you've already provided. i wanted to sort of touch a little bit on maybe how we should think about the complexity of the -- maybe the tax work specifically and how that might compare year-over-year with -- and what kind of opportunities that might provide for you? and also, i know the last couple of years, we've had the timing of federal balance offset. so i'd like to talk a little bit about maybe how we should be thinking about what the differences are as far as this year versus the prior years as far as tax filing activity?
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
okay. hey, marc, i have the tax filing question. the first part of that question, you broke up a little bit. can you please help us with that again? you were talking about some complexity in the business. i didn't fully understand.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
oh, sure. so we're talking complexity of what the filing that can be made. so not just in timing, but either as far as tax goes, as far as uncertainty as far as what may or may not be in stimulus packages, additional ppe opportunity -- ppp opportunities, things like that.
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
i got it. thank you, marc. so let me address them in order here. as it relates to complexity, we would expect some changes to come out of congress. and as you know, in our business, when there are changes that provide an opportunity for us to be in front of our clients in front of prospects, talking to them about how those changes impact their business. so any changes in the regulatory environment is generally positive for us. and so we would expect some of that. it's very difficult to measure. as you know, the biden administration is talking about another round of stimulus into the economy. they're talking about infrastructure. so all of that will provide opportunities for us to be talking to our clients about how that may impact them, and that's just nothing but positive. it's very difficult to put a precise forecast on that, but generally positive.
as it relates to the timing of tax filings, that's a very good question and one worth noting, again, another reason why it's difficult to measure us on a quarter-to-quarter. last year, as you know, the tax filing deadlines were extended from april 15 to july 15. we can then roll right into another -- the second busy season after that in the fall. that's not likely to recur this year. there is some discussion around moving the tax filing deadline from april 15 to maybe may 15, but it's not likely to push out as far as it did last year. more to come, that's still very uncertain. so for now, we are planning on an april 15 tax filing deadline. and you'll see it when we do if that extension gets pushed out.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. another one for me. i wanted to touch a little bit on your comment on the success of early investments on the new producer programs. just wondering if you could delve a little bit into that and maybe what you're seeing that gives you some confidence there and what we might see in future investments there. thank you.
jerome. grisko -- president, chief executive officer
yes. thanks, marc. so as you know, historically, if you go back several years, we were not growing organically at the rates that we would expect from a number of our businesses on the benefits and insurance side. primarily, the reason for that is we have outstanding teams there. we have outstanding producers. they do a very good job of -- in production. we just didn't have enough of them, right? so every year, you're going to lose, if you have a $100 million business, you should expect the industry kind of benchmark is 10%. so you'll lose 10%. so you go from $100 million to $90 million, you need to fill that back up, so go back up to $100 million, so $10 million of new sales before you're showing growth. and that just takes more and more producers. so realizing that that was a necessary investment, we started along this path about three years ago, 3.5 years ago.
as we would with any significant expense, we had models built and business plans established, and we are now going back, obviously, and measuring against those things. and our comments are that we are very pleased that the producers that we're onboarding are actually producing at higher levels than we had expected them to produce in the non-validated category, which is before they start to kind of cover their draws. and most importantly, the validated producers, which are the more seasoned producers that tend to produce at a much higher rate, they are achieving that position faster than we had expected in our model. so kind of check, check, check across the board. very pleased with that we decided to make those investments, very pleased with how those investments are performing. and we're taking much of the lessons that we learned principally within our employee benefits group. great shoutout and the team here have done a really outstanding job. we're taking many of the lessons that we learned there and bring them into other lines of business because of the success that we've enjoyed.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
that's very encouraging. thank you very much.

thank you, and good morning, everyone. with the release of our first quarter results this morning, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. we experienced growth in total revenue, same unit revenue, earnings per share and adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2021. these results provide important momentum for the remainder of the year. our results demonstrate the fundamental attributes of our business model that i've emphasized throughout the past year. these characteristics continue to enable our positive performance during both favorable and less favorable business conditions. these attributes include the proportion, representing approximately 70% of our revenue that comes from essential and recurring services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that our clients rely on us to provide regardless of business conditions. our high client retention rates, our broad geographic footprint, the diversity of our client base in terms of industry and size of business, our strong and consistent cash flow and the substantial amount of variable expenses in our business. we continue to capitalize on the stability that our business model affords. throughout the last year and into the first quarter of 2021, we have watched how these attributes provided us an opportunity for growth regardless of economic environment. in addition, we continue to be extremely vigilant in managing our overall expenses and discretionary spending. practices we focused on at the start of the pandemic and carried into the first quarter of this year.
as recovery continues, and we return to some level of normalcy, these expenses will begin to return as well, albeit at somewhat reduced levels compared to 2019. now i will turn to the performance of our two primary practice groups. within our financial services group, we continue to experience very strong demand for our core services, including many of the compliance-related services that are weighted more heavily toward the first quarter of each year. this year, the irs tax filing deadline was extended to may 15, so a portion of our tax compliance revenue work will extend beyond the traditional mid-april time frame. within our discretionary and project-based businesses, we continue to experience increasing demand for our litigation support business and are seeing returning interest in our private equity advisory services and our valuation services. further, we anticipated that some project-based and discretionary work that was put on hold or delayed last year would carry over into 2021, and we are seeing that now, especially for our services that touch m&a transactions. while it is still too early to tell if this trend will continue throughout the year, all signs are positive and we remain encouraged based on the general level of optimism we are hearing from our clients and the external signs of economic recovery.
also, important to note, the passage of the most recent covid relief bill and stimulus package, like those passed in 2020, present new considerations for businesses and translates to more opportunities for us to deepen our client relationships and offer support when our clients need it most. we continue to be active in our outreach and engagement of our clients to help supporting accessing these new and expanded opportunities. our government healthcare consulting business ended 2020 strong and started this year with tailwinds as delayed contracts resumed, and we find our clients have largely adjusted to working with us using virtual tools. we are also seeing new projects move forward, including increasing interest in our services related to managed care, which means additional opportunities for this business. turning to our benefits and insurance group. we started the year strong and are seeing a continuation of the positive trends that we experienced in the second half of last year in our employee benefits business, the core of our property and casualty business, and the advisory services provided within our retirement plan services businesses.
client retention is also up for these same services so far in 2021. from a consolidated viewpoint, we continue to experience some softness in the portion of our payroll business that generally serves smaller businesses, including a number in the food services industry. to put this in context, the total revenue from this segment of our payroll clients represents less than 4% of cbiz' total revenues. one additional area i want to highlight is our investment in producers. our ability to track, retain and develop our producers is essential to accelerate organic growth, and i am pleased to report that our overall number of producers is up at the start of 2021, and we continue to make progress in this area. the new producers we brought on in recent years continue to outperform our projections. and as a result, we are continuing to add new producers and to expand this program to other areas of our business. in summary, we are pleased to start 2021 in a position of financial strength with a strong balance sheet, low debt and ready access to capital.
with that, i will turn it over to ware for his comments.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. i want to take a few minutes to run through the highlights of the numbers we released this morning. with total revenue growing by 8.4% in the first quarter, revenue growth from acquired businesses accounted for 4.8% of that growth, with same unit growth up by 3.6%. after facing uncertainty in 2020 coming into this year, we were unclear how the year-over-year comparison to 2020 would unfold in the first quarter. the core business has continued the steady performance that we saw through much of last year. and as expected, the advisory and transaction-oriented business services that were more vulnerable to the conditions encountered last year have largely stabilized, and we are positioned to record growth this year. our financial services group recorded total revenue growth of 8.1%, with same unit revenue growth of 4.5%. with no industry concentration within our core services clients, the diverse set of clients we serve lend stability to this business.
the acquisitions we closed last year are performing extremely well, with the only soft comparison being the private equity focused advisory business where the first quarter this year compares with a strong first quarter a year ago. we currently have a full pipeline of prospective work within this group and we expect to report growth for the full year. continuing to work under remote conditions, our government healthcare consulting business had a strong first quarter. turning to the benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by 9.6%, with same unit revenue growth of 1.6% in the first quarter this year. some of the transactional-based businesses, such as payroll services, are soft in comparison with first quarter a year ago. but after reporting a same unit revenue decline of 3% for the full year last year, the 1.6% first quarter same unit revenue growth within benefits insurance this year is noteworthy. as jerry commented, our investment in additional producers that has occurred in recent years is resulting in stronger pipelines of new business. we are continuing to invest in bringing additional producers onboard to further enhance growth prospects.
when coupled with strong client retention, we are well positioned for growth. as jerry discussed, we remain vigilant in managing our expenses, which include for example, lower levels of expense for travel and entertainment that given the constraints caused by the pandemic are directly tied to our remote work. also, as a reminder, in the first quarter a year ago, we recorded an additional $2 million of bad debt expense. and so with the improvement in client receivables we are seeing, bad debt expense was lower this year. we are pleased to report 390 basis point margin expansion on pre-tax income, leading to a 39.4% increase in earnings per share, up to $0.92 per share this year compared with $0.66 in the first quarter a year ago. as we progress through this year, we intend to resource some level of discretionary spending, and that may challenge the year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter and for the balance of the year. for example, our investment in our national marketing media campaign was paused throughout 2020, but this is now under way in the second quarter. also, last year, as we pointed out in our quarterly calls, benefits and healthcare costs were lower as many medical procedures were delayed or deferred. after experiencing lower trends in this cost in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, benefits and healthcare costs were again lower in the first quarter this year.
this expense is hard to predict in the near term, but we expect a more normal level of expense over the balance of this year. so bear in mind, this trend may create some volatility to margin as we progress through the balance of this year. you will see a table attached to our earnings release that reconciles the impact of the accounting for gains and losses in our deferred compensation plan assets. this impacts our reported gross margin, which was 27.1% on an adjusted basis this year compared to 22.6% a year ago. and operating margin on an adjusted basis was 22.4% compared with 18.2% a year ago. as a reminder, there is no impact to pre-tax income. cash flow has continued to be strong, with days sales outstanding on receivables improving from 94 days a year ago to 91 days this year. seasonally, cbiz typically uses cash in the first quarter each year as receivables build in connection with our busy season revenue. at march 31 this year, the balance outstanding on our $400 million unsecured credit facility was $162 million compared with $108 million outstanding at december 31, 2020. this leaves approximately $230 million of unused capacity at march 31. so we have plenty of dry powder to address strategic acquisition opportunities as well as continue with share repurchases. in the first quarter, we used approximately $32.7 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. since the end of the quarter through april 27, we have purchased approximately 270,000 additional shares under a 10b program for a total of approximately 1.4 million shares repurchased this year to date. as a result of this repurchase activity, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count for 2021 within a range of 54 million to 54.5 million shares, which represents a slight reduction in our full year expectation compared with guidance earlier this year, and we will provide further updates as we progress through the year.
of course, strategic acquisitions continue to be the top priority as we deploy capital. with over $200 million of unused capacity, we have the flexibility to be aggressive in pursuing potential acquisitions. last year, we closed seven acquisitions, and we announced an 8th acquisition effective on january one this year. collectively, these acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $48 million of annualized revenue, and we will see these transactions contribute to revenue growth throughout this year. in the first quarter, we used $3.7 million for acquisitions, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in previous years. future earn-out payments are estimated at approximately $11.8 million for the balance of this year, $16.1 million next year in 2022, approximately $9.7 million in 2023, approximately $13.5 million in 2024, and $800,000 in 2025.
jerry will comment further on the recently announced acquisition, which is effective on may 1. and to be clear, the numbers i just referenced do not include the impact of this new acquisition. beyond the acquisition we announced today, we continue to have a full pipeline of potential acquisitions. capital spending in the first quarter was $1.1 million. last year, capital spending for the full year was $11.7 million. and for 2021, we continue to estimate capital spending at approximately $12 million to $15 million for the full year. adjusted ebitda grew by 28.5% to $73.3 million reported in the first quarter this year, up from $57 million a year ago. the margin expansion on adjusted ebitda was 370 basis points to 24.3% of revenue this year compared with 20.6% a year ago. the effective tax rate in the first quarter was 24.1%, and we continue to project an effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 25%. of course, as a reminder, the effective tax rate can be impacted either up or down by a number of factors that can be unpredictable, and we are not speculating on the impact of potential legislative changes in the tax rate that may occur.
so with these comments, i'll conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i'd like to touch on a couple of additional areas before we turn it over for q&a. first, in regards to m&a, we started 2021 with the strongest m&a pipeline we've had in many years. already this year, we've completed one acquisition within our core accounting and tax practice and another within our retirement plan services business. i mentioned the acquisition of middle market advisory group during our last call. m&a provides tax, compliance and consulting services to middle market companies and family groups in a number of attractive industries and is located in denver, colorado. this acquisition complements our rapidly growing denver based practice. i'm also pleased to announce the acquisition of wright retirement services, a provider of third-party administrative services to retirement plan clients across the country. located in valdosta, georgia, wright retirement services has a long-standing relationship with cbiz as a client, and we are excited by the opportunity to offer their clients a broader array of services. as we commented in our earnings release, we are also pleased to announce our latest acquisition and welcome the new team to cbiz.
this week we signed definitive documents to acquire the non-attest assets and business of bernston porter, a bellevue, washington based accounting firm. as you know, for a number of years we've talked about identifying partners and completing acquisitions in attractive and growing markets. the pacific northwest has been high on our list. to enter a market like this, we wanted to do it with a partner that brought the size, scope and client base that would serve as a platform and be a catalyst for growth in that region. and as always, we prioritize cultural fit, alignment of values and strong leadership as essential for future success. over the years, we've evaluated a number of opportunities in the greater seattle metropolitan market, and that process led us to bernston porter. founded in 1985 by bob bernston and greg porter, over time bernston porter grew to be one of the top 10 cpa firms in the puget sound region. bernston porter's team, under the leadership of president mary actor, brings with it an outstanding reputation for exceptional client service, a commitment to the growth and development of their team members, and service to the communities where they work and live, all qualities that align with cbiz' core values and beliefs. the effective date for this acquisition is may 1, but we wanted to do announce it today as all conditions to closing have been satisfied. i want to take this opportunity to welcome the bernston porter team to cbiz. m&a continues to be a key component of cbiz' growth strategy and will be a top priority for us in 2021 and beyond, especially as we see increasing interest in cbiz as a potential partner.
our performance over the last year on the backdrop of the pandemic demonstrates the value and stability of our business model. we also continue to emphasize our unique position in the market, given the breadth and depth of our expertise and services and our strong and steady cash flow. our access to capital allows us to continue to make investments in the business that many of our competitors simply cannot afford. we know that these messages resonate with firms in each of our various businesses, and we are eager to explore these opportunities. i would now like to turn to our revised guidance. as a result of our strong performance in the first quarter and the acquisition of bernston porter effective on may 1, we are revising upward our previously announced guidance. our revised guidance is to grow revenue between 8% to 10% and earnings per share within a range of 12% to 15% for the full year of 2021 compared to the full year of 2020. while there is still uncertainty as we navigate this next phase of the pandemic, our guidance assumes that recovery will continue and that business conditions will remain the same or improve throughout the remainder of the year. with this revision and guidance and the announcement of the acquisition, i want to point out that bernston porter is a traditional accounting firm that recognizes a disproportionate amount of its revenue in the first half of the year due to the timing of tax deadlines in the busy season. given the seasonal nature of this business, the earnings impact of this acquisition will be more fully realized in 2022 and beyond.
with this, i will turn it over to q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question is from andrew nicholas from william blair.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
thank you and good morning. i wanted to start with the question on m&a. and i mean it with respect to the broader market, not cbiz specifically. obviously, it was in, i think, record levels throughout the first quarter. is there any way for you to maybe help me or help us dimensionalize how much it positively impacted your growth in the period? and also, how you think about your exposure to that dynamic for the business as a whole?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
so andrew, this is jerry. when you think about how it impacted our growth, that would be difficult to really tell and i'll tell you why. there's really two pieces of our business that really are highly dependent on, specifically highly dependent on acquisitions. the first is the obvious one, the private equity advisory business that we have. that's now about a $50 million business. in that business, we provide quality of earnings, we provide fp&a, we provide a host of other services principally and primarily to private equity funds for their portfolio companies in assessing acquisition opportunities. that $50 million is obviously highly tied to the general broader overall m&a activity market. but we also do an awful lot of work with our clients within our traditional accounting practice around helping them structure and consider capital, large capital investments of all sorts, certainly including m&a. and that's a little bit more difficult for us to assess as to how the direct dollar impact. but i will tell you that a more robust economy, a more favorable business climate for m&a certainly helps us in our growth for the year.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
great, thank you. that's helpful. and then i know you touched on it a little bit in your prepared remarks where, but gross margins at the segment level looked to beat records by a pretty sizable amount for each segment. so i was kind of hoping you could spend some time walking through what's driving that improvement and maybe speak to the sustainability of that level of performance in future years, understanding that q1 is seasonally high and that there are some costs that you'll layer back in as the pandemic kind of hopefully fades away. but any color there would be helpful.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, andrew, thanks. yes, the gross margins and pre-tax margins were extraordinarily high in the first quarter, and they were aided by a couple of year-over-year comparisons, which quite frankly, won't be sustainable throughout the year. they were unique to comparing this year and the expense levels versus last year, which was largely pre- covid expense levels. so first of all was the bad debt expense, roughly a $2.2 million swing. that's a one-time first quarter comparison that won't be sustainable for the balance of the year. also we had, on the benefits and insurance side, we typically get in the first quarter the carrier contingents and carrier bonuses that relate to the prior year of client retention and claims experience and things like that.
so that also was kind of a one-time non recurring favorable thing to the first quarter, and that was a $1.4 million item. and then when you just look at the other expense items like travel and entertainment, it continued to be very low this year as it was most of last year. but in the first quarter, remember, covid really didn't start to impact our expense levels until about midway through march when to stay at home orders and those things started to impact the business. so once again, you have kind of a favorable year-over-year comparison in the first quarter with respect to the expense levels. so the key takeaway would be that, yes, we're very pleased to see that big margin expansion for the first quarter. but we're going to experience some choppiness this year as we signaled with the original guidance.
we're going to see some choppiness this year with respect to the year-over-year comparisons just because -- and another example we talked about was the marketing media campaign. we totally paused and pulled that out of the mix last year on a discretionary basis just to protect the business. this year, we think it's the right thing. it will enhance long-term opportunities. so in the second quarter, you're going to see the impact of that expense, whereas last year you wouldn't have seen it. so i think it's fair to say that we will see margin expansion this year. we commonly say on a long-term basis, it's our goal to get 25, 20 to 50 basis points improvement each and every year. and i think that will occur this year, but it certainly won't be upwards into the 300-plus basis points just because of the things i talked about.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you very much. and if you wouldn't mind me squeezing one more in on the government healthcare business, i think you noted in your prepared remarks some acceleration there. but i'm just wondering -- well, i guess first, could you say what the specific growth was for that business in the quarter? but also, maybe just more qualitatively, how close is that business to returning to pre-pandemic type utilization levels? and if you have any thoughts on the recovery cadence for those levels to the extent that they haven't already come through? thank you.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
andrew, this is ware again. that business, and you may remember and maybe that's behind your question, we've often said it typically grows in the high single-digit range. but at some point, it gets big enough that the percentages get really tough, but the growth dollar-wise is still pretty impressive. last year, as we converted to remote conditions, the good news was we saw very little disruption in client work, but some of it was pushed out and delayed just because remote work is less efficient. and so some of that will come back into this year. and we did grow in the first quarter, kind of mid-single-digit range, not high single-digit range, and that's the expectation for the year.
andrew nicholas -- william blair -- analyst
thanks again.

[operator instructions] our next question is from marc riddick from sidoti & company.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. so, wondering if you could talk a little bit about the opportunities for growth around hiring and maybe what you're seeing there and what those plans may be to sort of take advantage of future opportunities? and then i have a couple of follow-ups around that.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, more specifically, marc -- i'm going to answer it, i'm not sure i really fully understand the question, but what we're -- in our plan, in our guidance for this year is the staffing that we have today. so we think we have plenty of staffing to achieve the guidance that we set out as far as growth is concerned. we are seeing, as you see generally in the economy, that there are some constraints on resources that are available. we believe that we have a compelling value proposition to our workforce, and we think that we'll win our share.
but there's no question that there is somewhat of a tightening of the labor market, certainly across the board, and that's also true in our industries. with that said, there's other opportunities, other levers in addition to just headcount that we can pull to achieve the growth that we, again, that we have put into our guidance in things including pricing, things including the types of services that we provide to our clients, the programs that we put in place to help our clients navigate things like the additional stimulus packages that are in the works. so we think we have a considerable number of levers that will help us get the growth that we've guided toward. hiring is certainly one of them. and we talked a little bit about the producer program. we also believe that we have a real and very attractive model to recruit into on the producer side, and we're confident that we will continue to add to those numbers.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then one of the things i wanted to circle back on, and during the course of the pandemic one of the things that you were very active with, was the outreach programs that you had for your customers as far as providing resources for information and sort of helping both your existing customers, but new potential customers sort of navigate as much as possible from an information standpoint, navigate the pandemic with information and webinars and the like. and i was wondering if there was any thought or if you've had the opportunity to sort of look at how that can sort of work going forward and maybe how that has translated into new customer growth and what that part may have played in generating the numbers that you were able to deliver today? thank you.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, mark, thank you. we learned a lot last year, right? first of all, it was very affirming as to our business model, our approach, the value of the breadth and depth of services that we provide, the value of the depth of the expertise we provide. and as i commented last year and i think at the end, early this year, that all came together in the way that we holistically packaged our products and services through webinars and through other client outreach programs to be able to serve them in ways that many of our competitors can't.
they just don't simply have the scope of services or the depth of expertise. and we've received terrific feedback from our clients and prospects through that engagement. and so to your question, that will continue into the future. we have programs that are continually being developed and hosted. we invite, again, clients, we invite prospects, key decision-makers to participate in those programs. and as a result, we are very, very pleased with the kind of top of the funnel on our new clients and additional revenue pipeline. so those things have worked for us. we learned how to execute that on those things much better in 2020 through the pandemic, and those programs will continue into the future.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then the last one for me, and i know this might be a little tricky, but i guess a couple of years ago we had the federal delay due to the -- following the company shutdown. last year, of course, was the initial pandemic and this year a one month delay in federal. is there sort of a way to -- so we haven't had a normal season, i suppose, in several years, but is there a way to sort of think about quantifying maybe how much potential revenue may have shifted or maybe even if there's a way to sort of think about what that difference might have been, if not versus last year because last year, of course, was unusual as well. maybe sort of compared to what it traditionally would have been under normal circumstances. thanks.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so marc, great point, what we're learning is there is no typical year, ok? we are always going to face something there. a lot of times, i think the very positive message that hopefully you've received over those periods of times, is that business doesn't go away. it may be deferred. there may be other reasons why the revenue might shift from one quarter to another or into the year. but generally, the revenue, once we have these contracts, we have long-standing relationships with these states. that work needs to be done. we're going to get that work done.
and it's really just a timing issue as between quarters and years. and that's often why it's very difficult and we caution against trying to model quarter-over-quarter results for us. because those can be large swings in a business as sizable as m&s and with regard to how large those contracts are. with that said, i think the best guidance that we can provide is the guidance that ware alluded to in his remarks, which is we've traditionally grown that business at kind of mid to high single digits. while it will be harder in the future to keep the percentage of growth at those levels as the business gets lower, i think you could look at certainly the dollar impact of that growth being fairly consistent over longer periods of time year-over-year.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i really appreciate that, and i just want to sneak in one last one. i wanted to sort of touch on, and this is sort of more general, but i wanted to get a sense of what your feelings were as to -- you guys have always done acquisitions and executed really well on them. and i was sort of curious as to maybe what those conversations are like? or it seems as though you would be a more attractive destination, relatively speaking, in the eyes of potential partners, future partners following the challenges like we've seen. so i was wondering if you got a sense that the conversations that you're having now, are they different than they were maybe five, six years ago when it's sort of fresh and clear that you're an attractive destination and future partner? thank you..
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, marc, they're not only different from five and six years ago, they're different from 18 months ago as a result of what we experienced over the past 20 -- in 2020 compared to many of our competitors. so let me kind of talk about both of those things. first of all, i think what people come to appreciate and recognize is that when they look back over our performance over a long period of time, we've had sustained revenue growth, we've had sustained earning margin, and we have substantial scale.
and so those attributes allow us to continue to make investments in the business, investments in practices, investments in technology, investments in people, investments in the growth and development and products and solutions for our clients that simply smaller competitors, they just don't have the resources to make those investments. and they come to appreciate those things.
the difference really over the past 20 months or -- i'm sorry, really over the past year since 2020 is, prior to that time, and we've seen this at various points in our history, prior to that time, we're only interested in bringing on the most highly regarded service providers in our markets and in our industries. and when we have those conversations with, whether it's on the accounting side or the benefits insurance side, oftentimes the response is, we know cbiz, we like cbiz, we really like what you're doing, we'd love to be part of it someday. but there's no compelling reason to do it today as opposed to tomorrow. what changed in 2020 is that they faced pressures that they would not typically face in more favorable economic conditions.
and things like being able to maintain your workforce, being able to continue to make investments in the business, being able to bring the types of programs that we're able to bring to our clients to help them in that very uncertain and unsettling time as we did in 2020. and then the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of our cash flow, breadth and depth of expertise, all of those things, we're telling that story. we were telling that story, by the way, in 2019 as well. but we're telling it in 2020 and 2021, and they're hearing it different, and they're leaning into that message more. and as a result, as i said at the outset of this call, we have had the fullest pipeline of m&a transactions that i've seen in many, many years, and that continues, and there's a great receptivity to the message.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst

our next question is from chris moore from cjs securities.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
right. good morning. just a few here. one follow-up on the gross margin. so obviously, where -- you did a good job going through where some of that excess margin is coming from. on the discretionary side, travel expense, does it impact the segments the same or differently?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, probably the bad debt expense delta would be clearly more oriented toward the financial services side, where we've got kind of the traditional billing and trade receivables with our clients. the carrier contingents would be impactful on the benefits and insurance side. and then i think on the travel and entertainment side, which i called out, it's probably proportionately equal to kind of the sales mix or the revenue mix between the two. without getting too -- i just don't have the details, but i think that is safe.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's fine. that's helpful. still, i want to make sure that i understand from a seasonality standpoint. obviously, financial services, very seasonal. on the benefits and insurance piece, the margins you walked through where in terms of why q1 gets impacted sometimes, etc. i guess, more from a revenue standpoint, you did $87 million in revenue in the first quarter in benefits insurance, 1.6%, i think, same story you said, so some acquisitions in there. what i'm trying to understand is, is that $87 million moving forward? how does the q1 revenue seasonality and benefits insurance, how significant is it?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, great question. most of the businesses that are embedded into the benefits and insurance aren't really seasonal. for instance, employee benefits, it's kind of throughout the year. and the payroll business is throughout the year pretty equally. retirement planning services, same thing. on the property and casualty side, when we see renewals that happen typically annually, you typically recognize the revenue there. so that might be a little more front-end loaded, kind of a year-end cycle as opposed to a midyear cycle. but i would say it's not highly seasonal because we have a fair share of clients that do a midyear renewal as opposed to a calendar year end renewal. i think the one seasonal thing that we did talk about was, that the carrier commissions that come through based on the prior year. and they typically come through in the first quarter.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and the last one, just in terms of the 8% to 10% revenue guide, is that pretty evenly skewed between acquisitions and same store? or is it more skewed toward to the acquisition side?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
it's probably -- it's safe to say that with the acquisitions accounting for a larger portion in the first quarter, that will continue throughout most of the year. that -- it's probably 2/3, 1/3 split as opposed to the typical kind of 50-50 split that might be more true over time.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
chris, i do want to clarify though, we don't -- we only count in that number, kind of acquisitions that have been closed. as you know, there are a -- there's a high [mortality] rate, it's hard to predict. so i don't want you to think that we have future acquisitions in that number.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
understood. understood. i got it. okay. that's helpful. i will leave it there.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. just -- we did eight acquisitions through january 1, plus just announced a new one. so it is more heavily weighted toward acquisitions this year.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst

jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. with the release of our second quarter results, i'm proud to report another quarter of exceptional performance, with strong growth across nearly every major service line. but before i comment on our most recent results, i'd like to discuss the legal settlement that was announced at the end of june. the settlement related to a lawsuit pertaining to actuarial services provided eight years ago by a former employee regarding valuation of pension plan liabilities. this suit was unusual in a number of ways, including the complex and technical nature of both the claims and defenses by each of the parties. there was also very little legal precedent related to many of the claims that guide the jury in their deliberations. these facts created unique risks, including the claims by plaintiff could have resulted in large jury verdict of up to several hundred million dollars if the jury elected to award punitive damages.
we were in the midst of the trial when the parties reached an agreement. given the complexity of the facts, the risk of substantial loss and the uncertainty inherent in jury trials, and this one, in particular, we believe that settling the case for the amount previously disclosed was the most responsible decision for the company and our shareholders. moreover, this settlement does not materially increase our debt and our steady cash flow, strong balance sheet and access to capital allows us to continue to make investments to grow our business, complete strategic acquisitions, buy back stock and fully fund our operations. it's also worth noting that this is the first legal sentiment in our 25-year history relating to an errors and omissions claim that substantially exceeded the limits of our insurance coverage.
and while we do not disclose the limits of our insurance coverages, we have considerably increased the amount of our coverage for e&o claims over the past eight years. it's also important to view the impact of the settlement in context as a nonrecurring events and not allow it to overshadow the exceptional performance and results that we are seeing in our business. with that, i want to turn to our performance for the first half of 2021. i am pleased to report that through the first six months of this year, we are seeing improved performance from nearly every major service line, resulting in the strongest year-to-date organic revenue growth that we've experienced in over a decade. within our financial services group, we continue to experience very strong demand for our core accounting and tax services.
we are also seeing a return of demand for our more project-oriented advisory services, particularly those related to helping our clients with acquisitions and divestitures. in addition, over the last several years, we've made substantial investments in tools and systems that assist our leaders to improve revenue and profitability and accelerate the time it takes to collect accounts receivables. our most recent results within our financial services division reflect the outcome of those investments. our government healthcare consulting business has -- also continues to enjoy solid growth. although that business has been somewhat impacted by delays, as some states are holding off on certain work until they are more fully reopened and resume more normal operations. even with these potential delays, the work is required and will be completed at some time in the future, but we are monitoring how timing may impact the rate of growth for this business through the remainder of the year.
turning to our benefits and insurance group. the trend continues to follow what we saw in the second half of last year with high demand in our employee benefits, property & casualty and retirement plan advisory businesses. within our property and casualty business, our commercial side of the business is fueling very strong growth. while we are also seeing steady improvement on the program side, throughout last year, we talked about some areas of our p&c program business being more impacted by the covid-19 pandemic than others. for example, the reduction in leisure travel and related spending, we experienced early in the pandemic impacted parts of that business like adventure sports. these areas are starting to come back as these industries continue to recover. in our payroll business, last year, specifically, during the second quarter, we saw a drop in the number of pays as our clients reduced their workforce.
while this trend eventually levelled off later in 2020, we are now seeing the number of pays trend upwards again, which points to recovery among our clients and creates additional opportunities for this business. while the number of pays has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there are reasons for optimism, given the current trends. client retention within our benefits and insurance business remains strong. similar to our financial services business, we are also experiencing increasing demand for many of our project-based services. for example, the improving economy is driving new sales and growth within our executive recruitment and compensation consulting practices as many businesses look to add talent and fill critical roles. one additional area i want to highlight is our investment in producers.
our ability to attract, retain and develop our producers is essential to accelerate organic growth, and i am pleased to report that we continue to make good progress in this area. the new producers we brought on in recent years in our employee benefits business continue to outperform our projections, and we have also added to the number of producers in our retirement plan services and our property and casualty businesses. we have also added to the capacity within our recruiting team to be more targeted in our outreach and accelerate our efforts to secure talent. with that, i will turn it over to ware for his comments.
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. i want to take a few minutes to go over the highlights of the numbers we released this morning and talk about what we expect for the full year. the results we reported for the second quarter and first half include the impact of two major nonrecurring items. as required, the reported gaap numbers fully reflect the impact of those items. but in order to provide greater clarity on the results from continuing operations, we have also presented adjusted numbers to exclude the impact of those items. jerry talked about the settlement we reached on the upmc matter and the second quarter charge of $30.5 million that we reported, net of insurance coverage. in addition, during the second quarter, we divested a small noncore wholesale insurance operation, and we recorded a gain of $6.4 million as a result of that transaction.
the earnings release includes a reconciliation of those nonrecurring items from the gaap presentation to arrive at adjusted earnings per share numbers. of course, we can answer any further questions you may have on these two nonrecurring items during the q&a period following our comments. but without going into further detail, i will focus my comments here on the adjusted numbers. we think the adjusted numbers are most useful to you as you assess the health and performance of our ongoing business. we are very pleased to report strong growth in total revenue of 17.6% in the second quarter and total revenue growth of 12.6% for the six months ended june 30. revenue growth is being driven by a combination of strong, same unit growth of 10.5% in the second quarter and same unit growth of 6.8% for the six months.
the acquisitions we made last year and through the first half of this year, have contributed 7.1% to growth in the second quarter and contributed 5.9% to revenue growth in the six months. the business service lines that were more covid impacted and reflected declines in 2020 are now recovering and have recorded growth through the first half this year. as we finished 2020, i commented that those businesses represented about 16% of total revenue, had collectively declined 12.8% for the full year 2020 compared with 2019. collectively, these businesses recorded growth of 6.7% for the first half this year, which is in line with consolidated first half same unit revenue growth. as evidenced by this very strong first half, 6.8% same unit consolidated revenue growth, the core businesses that recorded growth last year in 2020 are continuing to perform very well the first half this year.
acquisitions continue to be an important component of our growth strategy. as a reminder, we announced seven acquisitions last year in 2020 that are expected to contribute $45 million of annualized revenue. through the first six months this year, we made four additional acquisitions that are expected to contribute $42 million of annualized revenue. the newly acquired businesses are performing very well, and we continue to evaluate a number of potential acquisitions with an active pipeline under review. total revenue in our financial services group increased by 21.1% in the second quarter, with same unit revenue up by 13.3% compared with a year ago. for the six months, total revenue grew by 14%, with same unit revenue up by 8.5%. turning to the benefits and insurance group.
in the second quarter, total revenue grew by 11.7%, with same unit revenue up by 5.3%. for the six months, total revenue within benefits and insurance grew by 10.6%, with same unit revenue up by 3.4%. the revenue growth recorded this year has been fueled by the tools and investments we have made in recent years. there have been significant investments to build stronger producer teams. we have developed tools to optimize profitability of client engagements within financial services. plus our focus on digital marketing efforts is resulting in a stronger pipeline of potential new business. and importantly, we have focused resources to boost acquisition activity. all of these initiatives are gaining traction and represent a concerted effort to enhance revenue growth while achieving operating leverage to improve margin over time.
eliminating the two nonrecurring items, pre-tax income margin was 12.7% in the second quarter, up 90 basis points compared with 11.8% a year ago. for the six months, pre-tax income margin was 17.5%, up 230 basis points compared with 15.2% a year ago. with early seasonal tax work this year compared with last year, we experienced tailwinds in the first half this year. the second half of the year is seasonally more heavily reliant on project work. the business is performing very well, but second half revenue growth may be less certain. a lower cost structure in the first half this year continues to reflect lessons learned from our experience with the pandemic and that is reflected in higher first half margins. as i commented at the end of the first quarter, we are selectively restoring discretionary items that may present some headwinds and margin pressure in the second half of the year.
as we begin to get back in front of clients and prospects, related t&e expense may begin to increase from current extraordinarily low levels. with marketing costs after suspending all programs a year ago, we elected to conduct a second quarter media campaign this year, and we are considering a second campaign later in the year. within our benefits costs, healthcare costs have continued to be lower than expected through the first half this year. health care benefit costs are not highly controllable in the short run, and we are expecting second half headwinds as medical visits and elective procedures are beginning to resume in a more normal level of activity after seeing low levels in 2020 that have continued through the first half of 2021. eliminating the impact of nonrecurring items, we are pleased to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 for second quarter, up 28.2% compared with $0.39 compared a year ago.
for the six months, adjusted earnings per share was $1.43, up 36.2% compared with $1.05 reported a year ago. cash flow and liquidity continue to be strong. at june 30 this year, there was $163.3 million outstanding on our $400 million credit facility. this results in a leverage measure of 1.0 times ebitda at june 30 with approximately $230 million of unused capacity. after giving effect to the upcoming payment for the upmc settlement amount, leverage will increase to approximately 1.25 times ebitda with slightly over $200 million of remaining unused capacity. during the first six months this year, we closed four new acquisitions and used $51.2 million for acquisitions, including earn-out payments for acquisitions closed in previous years. we also actively repurchased shares in the open market, and we used $63.4 million to repurchase approximately two million shares through june 30.
with respect to future earn-out payment obligations, we estimate approximately $5.5 million over the balance of this year, approximately $20.8 million in 2022, approximately $14.4 million the following year in 2023 and $17.7 million in 2024 with another approximately $800,000 in 2025. the strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we have ample flexibility to strategically deploy capital to actively pursue acquisitions and conduct share repurchases. looking back 18 months during this challenging time period from january of 2020 through today or through june 30 of this year, we have closed 11 acquisitions using approximately $140 million of cash for acquisition purposes. over the same 18-month time period, we've also used approximately $120 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares, which is nearly 8% of shares outstanding. capital spending.
the first six months this year was $3.3 million with $2.1 million in the second quarter. this is lower than in recent years and reflects the intentional deferral of spending for facility-related decisions in 2020. in a normal year, we expect capital spending of approximately $12 million. but for 2021, we expect capital spending will come in at approximately $8 million. day sales outstanding on receivables continue to reflect improvement. at june 30 this year, day sales outstanding stood at 84 days compared with 87 days at june 30 a year ago. with a diverse set of clients and no concentration in industries such as hospitality, entertainment or travel that may have higher risk attributes, our receivables have continued to perform well. you may recall, we recorded a $2 million provision for bad debt in the first quarter a year ago, with bad debt expense for the first half a year ago at 62 basis points of revenue.
bad debt expense for the first six months this year is only five basis points. adjusted ebitda for the first six months this year was $116.2 million or 20.1% of revenue. this represents a 25% increase over $92.9 million in the first six months a year ago. for the first six months this year, the effective tax rate was 24.01%. looking to the full year of 2021, there are a number of unpredictable factors that can impact the effective tax rate, either up or down, and we expect to continue -- we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 25%. with the share repurchase activity to date through the first half, we expect full year 2021 weighted average fully diluted share count to be approximately 54 million shares. as a result of first half acquisition activity, we are raising our full year revenue guidance, and we now expect total revenue growth in a range of 10% to 12% over the prior year, and that this is up from 8% to 10% growth previously.
first half growth in adjusted earnings per share reflects the fact that the business is very healthy. as we set full year expectations for adjusted earnings per share, we are weighing the uncertain potential to incur higher benefit healthcare costs in the second half, coupled with our desire to selectively restore some level of marketing or other client-related activities designed to enhance revenue growth over time. for those reasons, the level of margin improvement achieved in the first half this year is likely not sustainable for the balance of the year.
we also need to be prudently cognizant of the continuing potential volatility and uncertainty in the environment. at this point, we expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share to grow near the higher end of a range of 12% to 15% over the $1.42 eps reported for 2020. of course, we will have an opportunity to revisit this guidance at the end of the third quarter. so with these comments, i will conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i'd like to touch on our m&a activity before we turn it over to q&a. as i discussed last quarter, we started this year with the strongest m&a pipeline we've seen in our recent history. m&a continues to be a key component of cbiz's growth strategy and will remain a top priority for us in 2021 and beyond, especially as we see increasing interest in cbiz as a potential partner. our performance over the last year on the backdrop of the pandemic demonstrates the value and stability of our business model. we also continue to emphasize our unique position in the market, given the breadth and depth of our expertise and our services. moreover, our steady cash flow, strong balance sheet and access to capital allows us to continue to make investments in the business that many of our competitors simply cannot fund.
we know that these messages resonate with firms in each of our various businesses, and we are eager to explore these opportunities. so far this year, we've completed four acquisitions with three of those coming in the second quarter. during the second quarter, we completed one acquisition to support our retirement plan services business and another, the acquisition of berntson porter, a core accounting firm located in the pacific northwest, which i discussed in our last earnings call. most recently, at the beginning of june, we completed the acquisition of optumas, a firm based in scottsdale, arizona that specializes in providing actuarial and consulting services to government healthcare agencies to assist in the administration of medicaid programs. optumas has a long history of partnering with cbiz, and this acquisition will allow us to expand our relationship with existing clients and enable opportunities to scale these services through our national infrastructure. with this, i will turn it over for q&a.

[operator instructions] the first question today will come from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
hey good morning guys, i have a couple of question.so yes, same-store growth was up, i think, 6.8% in the first half. i'm just trying to get a better sense in terms of how pricing increases works in that. can you maybe talk a little bit the mix between price increases and increased volume from cross selling, share gains, etc.?
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hi chris, this is ware. we did get some higher yield and some price increases aligned with some of the efforts we talked about to increase or improve efficiencies and the engagement on the financial services side. and then, of course, market conditions on the property and casualty insurance side are -- it's a strong market. so there are some increases there as well. we typically would say, and i don't think this is anything unusual for the first half this year, about half of the increase is due to volume and just increased activity, whereas about half of it is due to pricing increases. i think that's the case here for the first half this year.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it, very helpful. how much revenue did the divested wholesale insurance business? how much was that generating on a kind of trailing 12-month basis?
ware grove -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, chris. this is ware again, slightly less than $3 million. it's actually a pretty small non-core piece of our business.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it, and just last one for me. on the university of pittsburgh settlement. so i know there's one other active case out there zotec partners. i'm wondering if maybe you could kind of compare and contrast that to the university of pittsburgh. for example, you talked about no real legal precedent, which was a big risk factor on university of pittsburgh, very complicated. kind of any thoughts on the zotec side.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
chris, this is jerry. yes, i'll provide a couple of comments on that. what i would say are very different facts and circumstances relating to upmc compared to zotec. the upmc claim was at its core an errors and omissions claim relating to work that we did, very complex actuarial work we did on a pension plan. the zotec case actually is a claim by the purchaser of, if you recall, our medical billing business some years ago. and again, very different claims, very different facts and circumstances, and we believe we have, as we've announced, strong defenses to that claim, and we will vigorously pursue those defenses.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it, i'll leave it there. thanks guys.
operator
[operator instructions] next question will come from marc riddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi good morning. so i was wondering if you could discuss a little bit around the announcements around the new headquarters and maybe some of the things that are going into to that and from a time frame and sort of how that might flow. i know that the pressures talked about next september. but i was wondering if you could sort of give a little bit of color around that and what we can expect there?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
so this is something we've been working on for a while. we've been in our existing facilities for about 18 years. and candidly, just the way that we work and the way that our workforce comes to work and the way we collaborate with each other has changed over that period of time. and while we're very happy with where we are and enjoyed certainly the time that we spent here, we were really excited about the opportunity to enter and to be an anchor tenant at a brand new facility, state of the art, we are actually at the table helping to design that facility as the acre tenant, and it will allow us to really prepare for the next 20 years and what that work -- the way our workforce comes to the office, the way that we collaborate with each other, the way that we collaborate with our clients, including state of the art technology, workflow in the design and the workspaces that are within that facility.
so kind of across the board, really just a great opportunity for us to do that. you probably also saw that we received considerable support from the state of ohio and from the local governments, and we're really appreciative of that partnership as well. so kind of everything came together to allow us to do this, and we're excited about what that means for us going forward.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and then the timing, i guess, is more -- so we're looking at the fall of next year. if i remember correctly, are we sort of targeting from a seasonal standpoint, it certainly doesn't -- it would be after tax season, but i was wondering if we should think about any potential disruptions or anything going on those lines to take into consideration for next year?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes, mark, the time -- you're right. it's in the fall of next year. we don't have exact kind of move in date, but it will be the fall of next year. the only kind of potential disruption, and i think it's pretty insignificant, particularly in light of what we've learned over the past year is that there will be some gap between the time that we leave this space, our existing space and the time that the next space will be available. but we're working through that now in the combination of flex base, which is available in our local market and some continued remote work will allow us to bridge that gap. so really no bearing material bearing on the business in the move that we can see right now.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay great, and then i was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about -- you touched on this in your prepared commentary, but i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on maybe some of the progress you're making because certainly from the numbers, it certainly seems as though it's positive. but are some of the benefits that you're getting from your marketing programs, whether it be the -- sort of the digital outreach that was ramped up during the pandemic, and maybe we're seeing the benefit of some of that as well as further progress that's made of those new contracts? and then maybe you could also talk a bit about how we should think about or how you feel your local market share has progressed during the course of the challenges of the pandemic?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
we see this like many businesses. we learned a lot over the past 16 months, right? and one of the things i think that has been most beneficial to us is our ability to provide really our value, our unique value proposition, which is breadth of services and depth of expertise in a way that, candidly, we haven't experienced before covid. so an example of that is when we sit with a client and our clients have multidisciplinary needs, pre-pandemic, oftentimes, we would have to fly people in from around the country, the experts, the subject matter experts to sit with our clients and sit with our team to solve whatever challenges or opportunities the client was working on. today, through the virtual tools that we've all learned to adopt, that's much easier to do.
our clients are far more receptive to that, and we're far more comfortable providing services in that way. as far as digital is concerned, we reached out to our clients, the outside of the pandemic with, as we talked about in earlier calls, very frequent webinar programs, trying to anticipate what was front of mind for them, what their greatest needs were in putting programs in front of them. and that effort has continued. we've also learned to follow-up with our clients using those digital channels and digital outreach in ways during that pandemic, and that effort has continued as well. and as a result of that, the top of the funnel for our sales pipeline has not been this full in many, many, many years.
so not only have we learned to identify opportunities and put them in the top of the funnel, but also to convert those opportunities to sales in a hybrid approach, some face-to-face, but certainly some more virtual. so -- and we're learning to close those opportunities as well. so we've learned a lot. we continue to learn, but the future looks very promising in all those regards.
marc riddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
very encouraging. thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] at this time, there are no further questions in the question queue. this will conclude today's question-and-answer session, and i would like to turn the conference back over to jerry grisko for any closing remarks.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sean. before i conclude the call today, i want to put our performance for the first half of this year in the context of our business model and what we believe these results mean for the rest of the year and beyond. over the last several quarters, i've emphasized the fundamental attributes of our business model, including the essential and recurring nature of our services, our high level of client retention year-over-year, the diversity of our client base in terms of size and industry and our broad geographic footprint. as we've demonstrated over the last 16 months, these attributes allow us to perform well even in uncertain economic conditions. moreover, the breadth and depth of our services puts us in a unique position to be responsive to our clients' needs, especially when they require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. i've talked about the importance of our model because of the strength and stability it offers in both good and less favorable economic conditions.
the extraordinary results we reported today are a testament to this model, but also demonstrate the potential of our business moving forward. for the first half of 2021, nearly all of our service lines are growing, many at the rate we have not experienced in year. in these results, we are seeing the return on our long-term investments we've made in our people, tools and systems. we're also seeing the value we bring to our clients in both new ways, but also in the services and solutions they rely on year-over-year. and of course, our team continues to be the driving force behind these results. the energy and commitment of our team and their willingness to go above and beyond for our clients and each other is evident in our performance. i'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in the first half and even more excited about what is possible as we look ahead. based on our strong performance year-to-date, we increased our revenue guidance today, and we are guiding adjusted eps growth to the high end of the 12% to 15% range that we previously announced.
for the reasons were outlined earlier, we are not yet prepared to increase our adjusted eps guidance, but remain optimistic, given the momentum in our business, and we look forward to revisiting this at the end of the third quarter. i want to close by thanking our analysts and our investors, as we always do for your continued support. and i'd also like to take this opportunity to invite our analysts and shareholders to participate in our virtual investor conference to be held in september. that will include deeper dives into our business, operations and culture, in addition to q&a with ware and i and some of our business leaders. you will be receiving an invitation and more information in the coming weeks. thank you for your time, and have a great day.

lori novickis -- director of corporate relations

i will now turn the call over to jerry for his opening remarks.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lori, and good morning, everyone. with the release of our third quarter results, i am extremely proud of our performance to date. our results in the third quarter and throughout this year continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business. we started this year with a good deal of optimism, especially given the performance of the business since the onset of the pandemic, the steadily increase in demand for our services that were experienced through the second half of last year and the level of confidence about the business climate that we're hearing from many of our clients.
even with our optimistic outlook, our performance to date has exceeded our expectations. while we oftentimes experienced some seasonal slowness in the third quarter, that has not been the case this year. the strong demand for our core essential services that we experienced through the first half of this year has continued through the third quarter, and our results have been bolstered by very strong performance from many of our more project-oriented advisory services that are often viewed by our clients as being more discretionary. and perhaps most encouraging, the strong performance reflected in our year-to-date results is coming from both of our major practice groups and across nearly all major service lines of our business.
within our financial services group, we continue to experience strong performance from our core accounting, tax and advisory businesses. and in addition, during the third quarter, we saw steady demand for our tax consulting services and robust demand across the board for our advisory services. these results reflect the strength of our current business climate and the overall confidence and optimism of our clients. as our clients take steps to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate growth in the future, these actions should translate into additional project-based advisory work for us. within our government healthcare consulting business, we are experiencing a rate of growth in the mid-single digits.
while this growth is consistent with our experience since the onset of the pandemic, we would expect to see accelerated growth in the months ahead as more states fully reopen and some delayed work resumes. a complementary acquisition that provides actuarial services that we made this past summer, is creating additional opportunities for us to bring even greater value to our government clients in the administration of complex healthcare programs.
now turning to our benefits and insurance group. we are also experiencing the continuation of the strong performance that we saw for the first half of the year. we continue to see steady demand for our core employee benefits, property & casualty and retirement plan advisory businesses. as we've discussed on prior calls, we've made substantial investments over the past several years to accelerate organic growth within our employee benefits business by adding to the number of producers. we are very pleased with the results that we are seeing in this area and the impact of our efforts are evidenced in our results today. within these results, i also want to emphasize the importance of client retention.
we continue to see retention rates of over 90% without our employee benefits business and for many of our other businesses within our benefits and insurance group. these levels of client retention speak to the value that our clients receive from our team and our commitment to bring them solutions that are unmatched in our industries. within our property and casualty business, we continue to see steady demand and production for both the commercial and program components of the business. we've described in the past earnings call how some industries like hospitality, lodging and adventure sports, were disproportionately impacted during the pandemic. we are seeing the return of these businesses.
and while some are not yet back to pre pandemic levels, the trend is positive. the strength of the market is also providing additional lift to our retirement investment services business and an increase in demand for more project-based work, such as our executive recruitment and our compensation consulting services. our payroll business is the one area where we continue to experience some softness. as we've mentioned on previous calls, this business serves a larger number of smaller employers that continue to be disproportionately impacted by current business conditions, including labor shortages.
overall, we couldn't be more pleased with our year-to-date results and the performance of our business. i will remind you that during our last earnings call, we raised our full year revenue guidance. today, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our revenue guidance and our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the remainder of 2021 and where we'll walk through what we expect in his comments.
with that, i will turn it over to ware.
lori novickis -- director of corporate relations
thank you, jerry, and good morning, everyone. our results for the third quarter and for the nine months ended september 30 continued to be very strong. i want to take a few minutes to talk about the highlights. with revenue up by 18.6% in the third quarter, and up by 14.5% for the nine months, demand for our core services continues to be stable and strong. same unit revenue for the third quarter grew by 8.3% compared with last year. and for the nine months, same unit revenue grew by 7.3% compared with last year. we are seeing growth in both our financial services group as well as the benefits and insurance group.
in the third quarter, total revenue in the financial services group grew by 20.4%. and for the nine months, revenue grew by 16%. same unit revenue in the financial services group was up by 9.2% in the third quarter. and for the nine months, same unit revenue was up by 8.7%. we are seeing growth across all major service lines, with particularly strong growth within our advisory business services. within our benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by 16.1% in the third quarter. and for the nine months, total revenue grew by 12.4%. same unit revenue within benefits and insurance grew by 6.6% in the third quarter. and for the nine months, same unit revenue grew by 4.4%. with the exception of our payroll services, where we are experiencing some slight softness, we are seeing growth in all service lines.
the investment in producers that has been underway for some time now is continuing to show positive results. the acquisitions we made last year and through the first nine months this year are performing well. these newly acquired operations contributed 10.3% to total revenue growth in the third quarter and contributed 7.3% to total revenue growth for the nine months. as we presented second quarter earnings earlier this year, we made an adjustment to eliminate the impact of the $30.5 million nonrecurring upmc settlement that was announced on june 30, plus an adjustment to eliminate the impact of the $6.4 million nonrecurring gain on sale from a divestiture that occurred in the second quarter. as required, gaap numbers are reported in our financial statements and the earnings release includes a reconciliation schedule from gaap numbers to the adjusted numbers.
on an adjusted basis, for the nine months, adjusted earnings per share was $1.84 compared with $1.41 a year earlier. this is up 30.5%. in the third quarter, earnings per share was $0.41 compared with $0.36 a year ago. in line with our comments during the second quarter call earlier this year, as we began to restore discretionary expenses, such as marketing, travel or as other healthcare benefit costs began to normalize from abnormally low covid influence levels from a year ago. we cautioned that expense headwinds would impact margin in the second half this year. as a result, margin on income before tax declined in the third quarter from 11.4% a year ago to 10.3% this year.
this is not a reflection on the health of the business. this is simply a reflection of the year-over-year pandemic influence impact on these costs, which reflect abnormally low levels a year ago. on an adjusted basis, eliminating the nonrecurring items i mentioned, we are very pleased that margin on income before tax for the nine months has improved by 120 basis points, up to 15.2% versus 14% a year ago. to date this year, we have closed five acquisition transactions that will contribute approximately $72 million of annualized revenue. through september 30, we have used $74.8 million for acquisition purposes, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in prior years.
future earn-out payments are estimated at approximately $6.6 million for the balance of this year, $26.7 million in 2022, $19.3 million in 2023, $22.9 million in 2024 and approximately $6 million in 2025. our continuing priority is to utilize capital to enhance growth through strategic acquisitions, and we continue to have a very active pipeline of potential acquisitions. with our strong cash flow, we also have the flexibility to repurchase shares. through september 30, we utilized approximately $85 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares. and since that time, through october 26, we have repurchased an additional 258,000 shares.
as a result of these share repurchases, we expect full year share count within a range of 53.5 million to 54 million shares. with strong revenue growth and expansion of margin, cash flow has continued to be strong. at september 30, debt outstanding on our unsecured $400 million credit line was $190.2 million with $201.6 million of unused capacity. leverage under the credit facility was 1.2 times adjusted ebitda at september 30. as a reflection of cash flow, adjusted ebitda for the nine months this year was $153.5 million, up 21% from $126.9 million a year ago. focused primarily on facility and office improvements, capital spending through september 30 was $6.5 million, with $3.2 million spent in the third quarter. full year spending may come in between $8 million to $10 million.
day sales outstanding on receivables was 88 days at september 30, and this continues to reflect improvements that were gained over the past 12 to 18 months. bad debt expense through september 30 this year was approximately 10 basis points of revenue compared with 41 basis points a year ago. our effective tax rate for nine months was approximately 24.5%. there are a number of unpredictable factors that can impact the tax rate either up or down, but we expect the effective rate for the full year within a range of 24% to 24.5%. as we look at the remainder of the year and update guidance on our full year outlook and as you begin to compare expectations to last year, be aware of the year-over-year anomalies to the items that i mentioned earlier.
headwinds with higher expense levels compared to last year on the same items we experienced in the third quarter, such as healthcare and benefits, travel and marketing are expected to persist for the remainder of the year. in addition, consider that we closed several significant business acquisitions in the financial services space in midyear this year. these operations will have a very positive full year impact on both revenue growth and contribution to earnings, and this will provide a significant tailwind for us in 2022. however, recognizing the typical seasonality of these businesses with higher first half revenue and profitability, we are projecting a slight operating loss in these newly acquired operations in the fourth quarter this year.
one other nonoperating item to point out is the impact of the timing of vacation expense accruals. in a normal year, vacation expense accruals are relieved throughout the year. last year, as we work with clients to maintain high levels of service throughout the pandemic conditions, a higher portion of vacation time was delayed into the fourth quarter. as a result, there was a larger-than-normal fourth quarter favorable adjustment last year as vacation expense accrual was relieved. this year, vacation accruals have followed a more normal pattern, so there is no significant favorable adjustment projected in the fourth quarter.
of course, there is no full year impact, and this is purely a covid influenced accounting anomaly that will be unique to the comparison of fourth quarter this year compared to fourth quarter a year ago. with revenue up 14.5% and adjusted earnings per share up 30.5%, the health of our business is very strong. as we consider the unique items described above that are projected to impact the balance of the year-over-year comparisons, our expectations for the full year are as follows: total revenue growth in 2021 is expected within a range of 12% to 15% over 2020.
adjusted earnings-per-share growth is expected within a range of 20% to 24% over the $1.42 earnings per share recorded in 2020. we expect a full year weighted average share count within a range of 53.5 million to 54 million shares. and unpredictable factors can impact the tax rate either up or down, but we expect a full year effective tax rate within a range of 24% to 24.5%. again, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the business this year. despite the several headwinds i described that impact the second half comparisons this year, the business is very healthy, and there are considerable growth opportunities as we look ahead.
so with these comments, let me conclude, and i'll turn it back over to jerry.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ware. i'd like to touch on our m&a activity before we turn it over for q&a. as i discussed last quarter, we started this year with the strongest m&a pipeline that we've seen in our recent history. the annualized revenue contribution from the five transactions that we've already closed this year will provide nice momentum going into 2022. in addition, we continue to have a very strong pipeline, including some larger deals, and there's still opportunity for us to close one or more of these transactions before year-end. while we are always looking ahead, i'd like to take a moment to talk about the most recent group to join our team.
f in early september, we completed the acquisition of shea labagh dobberstein, and accounting, tax and advisory services firm based in san francisco, bay area. sld serves privately held businesses, individuals and nonprofit organizations across the west coast and has offices in san francisco, san mateo and walnut creek, california. this acquisition is part of our long-term growth strategy on the west coast. sld complements our existing geographic footprint and increases the visibility of our brand while adding valuable capacity and scale in this growing market. moreover, we always seek to find partners that share our commitment to client service and demonstrate a strong cultural fit and alignment on core values. sld checked all of these boxes and more, and we look forward to working together to bring even greater value to our teams, our clients and to accelerate growth.
with this, i will turn it over for q&a.

[operator instructions] the first question will come from chris moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. thanks for taking a couple of my question. so same-store growth for the nine months, 7.3%; financial services, up 8.7%, b&i, up 0.4%. so do you expect the relative contribution to same-store growth to become more balanced over the next few years or financial services likely to be -- continue to be the key driver there?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
so chris, this is jerry how are you today? what i would say is they're both benefiting. both sides of our business are benefiting from a very favorable business climate for small middle market businesses generally. and that's really what we're experiencing today. as to the rate of growth between those two organizations, i wouldn't say that we would expect one to be stronger than the other, we would expect for both of them to continue to be reasonably strong, of course, subject to the business environment that they're facing. the growth is coming in a couple of different areas. part of the reason that the growth in financial services is a little stronger year-to-date and through the third quarter is really as a result of the extraordinary amount of activity that we're seeing in our advisory practice. and if that continues, largely driven by transactions and favorable outlook of our clients, we would continue to see stronger growth. but it's hard to predict those things.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that. so obviously, lower covid expenses in 2020 kind of impacts the comparison. we did a good job talking about the catch-up in the second half of 2021. and well, i recognize you're not providing 22 guidance. still trying to understand the adjusted eps range of $1 70, $0.76 this year. what should we be considering for 2022 versus just the normal growth of the following year? is there still a meaningful amount of catch up that's going to happen in 22 on the expense side?
lori novickis -- director of corporate relations
hi chris. this is kind of a -- and i think you nailed it. it's a bit of a complicated analysis when you look at 2020 versus 2021 and then flip to 2022. we had lower first half expenses this year, but they're normalizing in the second half. so yet again, in 2022, you should see a year-over-year comparison to some of these expenses that should be slightly higher than the full year run rate this year, ok? having said all that, the lessons learned for us as we've transitioned more to a virtual service model that the travel and entertainment component will probably settle in. historically, that's been about 2.5% of revenue, and we think it's going to settle in closer to 1.5% of revenue. and that's a sustainable, i think, long-term beneficial trend. the other expenses of marketing will probably stabilize at historic rates. and of course, healthcare and benefits will probably stabilize at historic rates as well.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's very helpful. and last one for me. just in terms of kind of bigger picture, how do you view the growth prospects of recent acquisitions versus the core business? i mean, for example, you got $72 million full year revenue acquired in 2021 given cross-selling and other opportunities, is it reasonable to think that revenue kind of grows more quickly than core revenue? i guess the real question is trying to understand if the kind of relatively high level of acquisitions in 2020 and 2021, create a little bit of potential, i don't know, revenue leverage for a lack of a better term? yes.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- as you know, it's hard to predict, right? our longer-term projection for that is that we will continue to grow in the 8% to 10% range and that about half of that will come in the form of organic growth and about half will come acquired. we were in those ranges historically. but in any given year, it's difficult to predict how much of that comes from organic versus acquired. as i've mentioned throughout this year and really the end of last year, we're really encouraged by the size of our pipeline and the size of the transactions that are in our pipeline, and that could lead to acquired revenue being at the higher end of those ranges in any given period of time, but it's very, very difficult to predict.
chris moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. all right. i'll leave it there. i appreciate it, guys.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from marc reddick with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
marc reddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
hi mark.
marc reddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
so i wondered if you could talk a little bit about -- first of all, i want to thank you for the -- all the commentary and everything they can from the investor day event, which was really great. last and also thank you for that. i wanted to ask a little bit about what you're looking at with the acquisition pipeline? and maybe if there's a way to sort of compare what you're seeing today and the opportunity that you're seeing today versus maybe historically, because you've always been quite active in the acquisition marketplace was. is there a way to sort of compare -- compare and contrast maybe what that environment is like today versus maybe some historical precedents?
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
hey, mark. this is jerry. what i would say is the pipeline today compared to prior to covid is fuller, and we would attribute that to a couple of things. first of all, certainly, within the accounting and tax side, that environment is changing somewhat in that over time, the firm's -- traditional accounting firms are recognizing that it's important for them to offer a breadth and depth of services and expertise that are going to require some investments back into the business, particularly on the advisory side. we've been making those investments for several years. others are now seeing the importance of doing that. so their decision is, do they make those investments themselves? or do they join a firm like ours, who's committed to making those investments and have already begun that process. so our story is resonating very well with many of the firms on the accounting space. the other thing that that the pandemic kind of shine the light on is the uniqueness just of cbiz. and it's the strength of our balance sheet.
it's the strength of our financials that allowed us, i think, to weather that storm in different ways in many ways better than many of the other firms. and not the least of which is how we supported our team members and kept our staff throughout that period of time. and so they understand that the value that, that would bring to them going forward. and lastly is just kind of the long-standing steady performance of our business and our culture and the values that we have, all of which resonate with those firms. and so as a result of getting out, telling that story more we've had a very receptive audience, and that's led to a much fuller pipeline today than we've seen in many years prior to this. on the other side of the business, i don't think the landscape has changed much. that's the benefits on insurance side. there remain opportunities certainly on the payroll side, certainly on the retirement plan services side and some opportunities as well within benefits and insurance and property and casualty, although that's a very competitive landscape has been, is -- will continue to be, given all the private equity activity in that space. so that's really what's leading to the pipeline that we have today.
marc reddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you for the color there. then i was wondering if you could switch gears a little bit. i wanted to go back to -- in your prepared remarks, making a mention on the retention being as high as it is or about 90% or so, i believe, is what was stated. -- you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in sort of post pandemic activity wise, if you're getting a sense of how that's creating cross-selling opportunities, maybe are you getting a sense that some of those folks that have may be worked with you in one area are now expanding. how should we think about the level of -- that level of retention and how clients are seeing you coming out of the pandemic.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, marc. the question really goes to two things. it goes to the retention of the clients we have and our ability to track new clients. and what we learned through the pandemic is that we have, i think, a unique value proposition to our clients and through prospects that allow us to do both. so, i think our clients, we were uniquely positioned to be able to help them understand some of the challenges that they were facing and some of the opportunities in front of them as a result of the breadth of our services and the depth of our expertise, which is really unmatched, i think, in our industries. and so we were able to bring them solutions, thought processes, analysis that brought great value to those clients. likewise, when many of others who aren't clients, prospects of ours were searching for solutions, we were able to reach those clients or those prospects through our thought leadership, through our webinars, and in many ways through digital channels that we had previously not really explored as much, but we had great success really beginning in the early stages the pandemic. we continue to have great success in our in our digital outreach to prospects into the market, and that also is allowing us to -- helping to fuel growth for us. so not only is it a retention tool, but it's also a growth opportunity for us.
marc reddick -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and that covers what would have been my next question.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to jerry grisko for any closing remarks.
jerome grisko -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you. this month marks an important milestone for cbiz as we celebrate our 25th anniversary. over the last 25 years, cbiz has become one of the leading providers of financial, insurance and advisory services to our clients and other businesses across the country. we're now a team of over 5,000 professionals with a network of over 100 offices in 31 states. for those of you who joined us during our investor -- virtual investor day presentation last month, we featured a brief video to highlight the history of how the company was founded and how we've evolved over time. if you haven't had an opportunity to view this presentation, you'll find it in the investor relations section of our website, cbiz.com, and i encourage you to take a moment to learn more about how we got here and our plans for the future.
i want to close today, as we always do by thanking our analysts and our investors for your continued support. and finally, our performance this year and the results that we continue to achieve are only possible because of our exceptional team. when i reflect on the past 18 months from the start of the pandemic and the changes that we've all adapted to, i'm inspired by how our team members continue to rise to the challenge. the growth that we've outlined today is a product of their tireless dedication and commitment to our clients and to each other. i'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together, and i want to express our gratitude to our team. thank you, and enjoy your day.
